It’s an attempt by the world&#8217;s governments to come together and create a set of international norms and standards for a reliable, trustworthy, safe, and secure Internet. It’s not an international treaty, but it does impose obligations on the signatories. It’s a major milestone for global Internet security and safety.</p>
<p>Corporate interests are all over this initiative, sponsoring and managing different parts of the process. As part of the Call, the French company Cigref and the Russian company Kaspersky chaired <a href="https://pariscall.international/assets/files/WG4-Final-Report-101121.pdf">a working group on cybersecurity processes</a>, along with French research center GEODE. Another <a href="https://pariscall.international/assets/files/WG4-Final-Report-101121.pdf">working group on international norms was chaired</a> by US company Microsoft and Finnish company F-Secure, along with a University of Florence research center. A <a href="https://pariscall.international/assets/files/10-11-WG3-Multistakeholder-participation-at-the-UN-The-need-for-greater-inclusivity-in-the-UN-dialogues-on-cybersecurity.pdf">third working group&#8217;s</a> participant list includes more corporations than any other group.</p>
<p>As a result, this process has become very different than previous international negotiations. Instead of governments coming together to create standards, it is being drive by the very corporations that the new international regulatory climate is supposed to govern. This is wrong.</p>
<p>The companies making the tools and equipment being regulated shouldn&#8217;t be the ones negotiating the international regulatory climate, and their executives shouldn&#8217;t be named to key negotiation roles without appointment and confirmation. It’s an abdication of responsibility by the US government for something that is too important to be treated this cavalierly.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is no surprise. The notions of trust and stability in cyberspace are about much more than international safety and security. They&#8217;re about market share and corporate profits. And corporations have long led policymakers in the fast-moving and highly technological battleground that is cyberspace.</p>
<p>The international Internet has always relied on what is known as a multistakeholder model, where those who show up and do the work can be more influential than those in charge of governments. The Internet Engineering Task Force, the group that agrees on the technical protocols that make the Internet work, is largely run by volunteer individuals. This worked best during the Internet’s era of benign neglect, where no one but the technologists cared. Today, it’s different. Corporate and government interests dominate, even if the individuals involved use the polite fiction of their own names and personal identities.</p>
<p>However, we are a far cry from decades past, where the Internet was something that governments didn&#8217;t understand and largely ignored. Today, the Internet is an essential infrastructure that underpins much of society, and its governance structure is something that nations care about deeply. Having for-profit tech companies run the Paris Call process on regulating tech is analogous to putting the defense contractors Northrop Grumman or Boeing in charge of the 1970s SALT nuclear agreements between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This also isn&#8217;t the first time that US corporations have led what should be an international relations process regarding the Internet. Since he first <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf">gave a speech</a> on the topic in 2017, Microsoft President Brad Smith has become almost synonymous with the term &#8220;Digital Geneva Convention.&#8221; It’s not just that corporations in the US and elsewhere are taking a lead on international diplomacy, they’re framing the debate down to the words and the concepts.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Different countries have their own problems, but we can point to three that currently plague the US.</p>
<p>First and foremost, &#8220;cyber&#8221; still isn&#8217;t taken seriously by much of the government, specifically the State Department. It’s not real to the older military veterans, or to the even older politicians who confuse Facebook with TikTok and use the same password for everything. It’s <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas">not even a topic area</a> for negotiations for the US Trade Representative. Nuclear disarmament is &#8220;real geopolitics,&#8221; while the Internet is still, even now, seen as vaguely magical, and something that can be &#8220;fixed&#8221; by having the nerds yank plugs out of a wall.</p>
<p>Second, the State Department was gutted during the Trump years. It lost many of the up-and-coming public servants who understood the way the world was changing. The work of previous diplomats to increase the visibility of the State Department’s cyber efforts was abandoned. There are few left on staff to do this work, and even fewer to decide if they’re any good. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-jobs-this-is-what-were-getting-wrong-when-hiring-and-heres-how-to-fix-it/">hard to hire</a> senior information security professionals in the best of circumstances; it&#8217;s why charlatans so easily flourish in the cybersecurity field. The built-up skill set of the people who poured their effort and time into this work during the Obama years is gone.</p>
<p>Third, there’s a power struggle at the heart of the US government involving cyber issues, between the White House, the Department of Homeland Security (represented by CISA), and the military (represented by US Cyber Command). Trying to create another cyber center of power within the State Department threatens those existing powers. It’s easier to leave it in the hands of private industry, which does not affect those government organizations’ budgets or turf.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to go back to the era when only governments set technological standards. The governance model from the days of the telephone is another lesson in how not to do things. The International Telecommunications Union is an agency run out of the United Nations. It is moribund and ponderous precisely because it is run by national governments, with civil society and corporations largely alienated from the decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Today, the Internet is fundamental to global society. It’s part of everything. It affects national security and will be a theater in any future war. How individuals, corporations, and governments act in cyberspace is critical to our future. The Internet is critical infrastructure. It provides and controls access to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a">healthcare</a>, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-to-build-satellite-internet-system-to-rival-spacexs-starlink">space</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/15/1080876311/ukraine-hack-denial-of-service-attack-defense">the military,</a> <a href="https://therecord.media/us-govt-reveals-three-more-ransomware-attacks-on-water-treatment-plants-this-year/">water</a>, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252513418/Ransomware-tied-to-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-last-year">energy</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/14/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/">education</a>, and <a href="https://threatpost.com/revil-hits-us-nuclear-weapons-contractor-sol-oriens/166858/">nuclear weaponry</a>. How it is regulated isn&#8217;t just something that will affect the future. It <i>is</i> the future.</p>
<p>Since the Paris Call was finalized in 2018, it has been signed by 81 countries &#8212; including the US in 2021 &#8212; 36 local governments and public authorities, 706 companies and private organizations, and 390 civil society groups. The Paris Call isn’t the first international agreement that puts companies on an equal signatory footing as governments. The <a href="https://gifct.org/about/story/#2017-year-in-review">Global Internet Forum to Combat Terrorism</a> and the <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/christchurch-call.pdf">Christchurch Call</a> to eliminate extremist content online do the same thing. But the Paris Call is different. It’s bigger. It’s more important. It’s something that should be the purview of governments and not a vehicle for corporate power and profit.</p>
<p>When something as important as the Paris Call comes along again, perhaps in UN negotiations for a cybercrime treaty, we call for actual State Department officials with technical expertise to be sitting at the table with the interests of the entire US in their pocket&#8230;not people with equity shares to protect.</p>

<blockquote><p>The group, which security firm Mandiant is calling UNC3524, has spent the past 18 months burrowing into victims&#8217; networks with unusual stealth.

<li>The use of a unique backdoor Mandiant calls Quietexit, which runs on load balancers, wireless access point controllers, and other types of IoT devices that don&#8217;t support antivirus or endpoint detection. This makes detection through traditional means difficult.
<li>Customized versions of the backdoor that use file names and creation dates that are similar to legitimate files used on a specific infected device.
<li>A live-off-the-land approach that favors common Windows programming interfaces and tools over custom code with the goal of leaving as light a footprint as possible.
<li>An unusual way a second-stage backdoor connects to attacker-controlled infrastructure by, in essence, acting as a TLS-encrypted server that proxies data through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS protocol</a>.</ul>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Unpacking this threat group is difficult. From outward appearances, their focus on corporate transactions suggests a financial interest. But UNC3524&#8217;s high-caliber tradecraft, proficiency with sophisticated IoT botnets, and ability to remain undetected for so long suggests something more.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc3524-eye-spy-email">Mandiant</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout their operations, the threat actor demonstrated sophisticated operational security that we see only a small number of threat actors demonstrate. The threat actor evaded detection by operating from devices in the victim environment&#8217;s blind spots, including servers running uncommon versions of Linux and network appliances running opaque OSes. These devices and appliances were running versions of operating systems that were unsupported by agent-based security tools, and often had an expected level of network traffic that allowed the attackers to blend in. The threat actor&#8217;s use of the QUIETEXIT tunneler allowed them to largely live off the land, without the need to bring in additional tools, further reducing the opportunity for detection. This allowed UNC3524 to remain undetected in victim environments for, in some cases, upwards of 18 months.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces &#8212; bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens &#8212; into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<p>Threat groups with known or suspected ties to the GRU have continuously developed and used destructive wiper malware or similarly destructive tools on targeted Ukrainian networks at a pace of two to three incidents a week since the eve of invasion. From February 23 to April 8, we saw evidence of nearly 40 discrete destructive attacks that permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations in Ukraine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mandiant:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/threat-intelligence">Mandiant Threat Intelligence</a> identified 80 zero-days exploited in the wild, which is more than double the previous record volume in 2019. State-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, led by Chinese groups. The proportion of financially motivated actors­ &#8212; particularly ransomware groups &#8212; ­deploying zero-day exploits also grew significantly, and nearly 1 in 3 identified actors exploiting zero-days in 2021 was financially motivated. Threat actors exploited zero-days in Microsoft, Apple, and Google products most frequently, likely reflecting the popularity of these vendors. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification of actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chromatophore size changes help squids communicate and camouflage their bodies to evade predators and hide from prey.
