<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School&rsquo;s about to be out for the summer in India&mdash;weeks earlier than planned. The sweltering spring heatwave that has built across the subcontinent since March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has in recent days forced several north Indian states to change schooling hours, revive lockdown-era online classes, and bring forward annual summer vacations. </span></p>

Until then, school hours are shifting forward, so that students can learn from 7 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., and return home for the hottest part of the day. The states of </span><a href="https://news.careers360.com/summer-vacations-chhattisgarh-schools-from-april-24-heatwave-heat-wave-in-india-bihar-telangana-odisha-andhra-pradesh"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chhattisgarth </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/schools-feel-the-heat-want-timings-changed/articleshow/91243552.cms"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haryan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced similar plans.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shutdowns like these save lives in India. The country is no stranger to <a href="https://time.com/6078019/city-heat-climate-change-inequity/" >extreme heat</a>, and authorities rely on </span><a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/india-and-pakistan-act-save-lives-from-extreme-heat"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring and warning systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent people from exerting themselves when temperatures get dangerously high. And states have brought forward school holidays</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/delhi-schools-ordered-to-close-early-for-summer-as-temperatures-soar"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with severe heat waves now regularly arriving weeks before the official start of summer, and after two years of COVID-19 closures that </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/world/asia/india-schools.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severely disrupted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian children&#8217;s education, some teachers say the country needs to do more to make its schools resilient to climate change. </span><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gurbachan-Singh"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gurbachan Singh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Punjab-based math teacher and representative for educators union the Democratic Teachers Front (DTF), accused the state of resorting to &ldquo;easy shortcuts,&rdquo; by shutting down schools. &ldquo;The government should give priority to holding regular classes and giving the schools proper power supply and weather-appropriate infrastructure instead of shutting them down,&rdquo; </span><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gurbachan-Singh"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singh</span></a> <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/school-timings-change-teachers-oppose-extended-summer-break/articleshow/91298531.cms"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Times of India</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is not the only country where weather extremes pose a challenge for schools. &ldquo;Climate change is increasingly having a very real impact on children&#8217;s opportunity to learn globally,&rdquo; says Robert Jenkins, UNICEF&rsquo;s director of education. &ldquo;We in the education sector are waking up too late to this challenge.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/rosa/media/11296/file/Rising%20to%20the%20Challenge.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2020 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by UNICEF of 25,000 students in eight <a href="https://time.com/longform/jacobabad-extreme-heat/" >South Asian countries</a>, 78% said climate change had impacted their education: 5% said climate impacts made their school unsafe, 19% said their journeys to school had been affected, and 25% said heat or flooding had left them unable to concentrate or forced them to drop out of classes. Heat is not the only culprit: in 2017, Vietnam had to close more than 325 schools in four provinces for nine days after a cyclone, and in 2015, a typhoon in the Philippines shuttered 803 schools for two weeks. The Global North is <a href="https://time.com/extreme-heat-climate-change/" >not immune</a> either. In the U.S., almost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in five students attended school districts that suffered federally-declared natural disasters </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104606.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">between 2017 and 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Such events are now happening &ldquo;with an increasing frequency, for a longer duration and over broader areas,&rdquo; Jenkins says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term implications for countries on the frontlines of climate change is worrying. A </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24639"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by U.S. nonprofit, the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that students in hotter countries performed worse than those in cooler countries on international standardized math tests. Within the U.S., researchers found a 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&deg;F </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase in the average temperature over a school year decreases test scores by 0.002 standard deviations&mdash;the equivalent of just under 1% of a year&rsquo;s worth of learning. It&rsquo;s hard to quantify the <a href="https://time.com/6093845/how-heat-hurts-the-economy/" >economic impact of climate change</a> on education systems, which includes everything from the cost of repairing damaged infrastructure to the knock-on effects on students&rsquo; future livelihoods, but the U.N.</span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/eap/media/4596/file/It%20is%20getting%20hot:%20Call%20for%20education%20systems%20to%20respond%20to%20the%20climate%20crisis.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the number is &ldquo;likely to be in the scale of trillions of dollars.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, governments have been slow to address threats to education as part of their climate plans, Jenkins says. In the short term, UNICEF is working with 145,000 schools in India on programs to share information about ways to stay safe while learning, and helping northern states to create heat action plans, which help schools determine risk levels at different temperatures. Some</span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ahmedabad-heat-action-plan-2016.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cities </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer pamphlets on heat risks for schools to send home to parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those steps only go so far. To keep children learning, many schools urgently need large-scale infrastructure improvements, Jenkins says, such as increased access to drinking water and sanitation, which is still lacking in large parts of rural India. Newly built schools need to be designed to be climate resilient&mdash;on stilts if they are in flood-prone areas, and with climate-specific architecture to mitigate heat risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 lockdowns have given many schools experience in running lessons remotely, but in Punjab, teachers&rsquo; unions </span><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/school-timings-change-teachers-oppose-extended-summer-break/articleshow/91298531.cms"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the government not to view online classes as a long-term solution to rising heatwaves. They cited lasting &ldquo;steep declines&rdquo; in student engagement due to &ldquo;ineffective online classes,&rdquo; and warned of a lack of access to internet and devices in low-income homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins agrees that school closures &ldquo;should be avoided at all times.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not only because of the risk of deepening educational inequalities, he argues, but also because schools, as the main way children and parents interact with local government in many parts of the world, can be a crucial platform for sharing information about safety precautions during climate disasters. &ldquo;Schools can be a really positive influence during those times, because children can engage their parents and their communities in the best way to deal with climate change.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Martyshkina did not expect to find herself living under the sea. But when she fled Ukraine on the first day of war, she did not expect much. As the sound of explosions on Feb. 24 sent her heart racing in her chest, all she knew was that she had to grab her 8-year-old son Danilo and run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Struggling to think clearly, she hardly packed anything. She just bundled her child on a bus that took a precarious route through the backroads of Ukraine to avoid the tortuous traffic jams on the main road to Poland. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We could see in the distance all the signs of the bombing,&rdquo; says Julia, a 35-year-old baker and cake decorator from Vinnytsia. Desperate to keep her child calm, she steadied her voice and told Danilo that they were on a special trip. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We are going to see Dad,&rdquo; she reassured him. </span></p>
<p>Dad&mdash; 36-year-old Vladimir, who is separated from Julia &mdash;was at that moment in the Netherlands, nearing the end of a stint of building work. He had been due to return home to Vinnytsia, a town about 250km southwest of Kyiv, a few days later. But instead he found himself racing to Poland to reunite with his son. Three days later, he brought the whole family back to the Netherlands.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is how Julia, Vladimir, and Danilo found themselves living in the hull of the M.L.V Castor, a restored Cold War-era Dutch gunboat docked in the center of Rotterdam&rsquo;s gleaming harbor. The re-purposing of the Castor to house 23 Ukrainians is part of efforts by the Dutch state to find beds for 50,000 Ukrainians, in a country facing its own acute housing crisis. Monasteries, holiday camps, private homes, army barracks and cruise liners&mdash;municipalities across the country have come up with their own unique solutions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 5.5 million people have fled Ukraine in the past few months, with most going to countries in the European Union. More than 3 million traveled to Poland, around 825,000 fled to Romania, and more than half a million are in Hungary. For the first time, the E.U. activated its </span><a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/rights-of-ukrainian-refugees-in-the-eu-explained-residence-education-work-more/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary Protection Directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that Ukrainians arriving in an E.U. nation have the right to live, work, attend school, and travel freely to any other E.U. country.</span></p>

<hr />
<p>Julia arrived on the M.L.V Castor on March 16, assigned her berth by the Rotterdam municipality after staying for a few weeks in a cramped room where Vladimir had been doing building work. While the couple are separated, they worked together for the best interests of their child. Julia recalls her first thoughts on seeing the 150-foot gunboat, restored to its original 1947 spec including three mounted cannons. &ldquo;Is it really possible to live here?&rdquo; she thought as she crossed gangplank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family&rsquo;s cabin is in the hull, below the water level. There are no portholes: just an emergency ladder leading up to the deck about 16 feet above. &ldquo;The first night I could not sleep because the water was slamming on the walls,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I kept thinking, &lsquo;I am in the water! I am under the water!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ship&rsquo;s owner, Mario van Parijs, says there was a similar reaction from many of the 23 people&mdash;mostly women and children&mdash;who were assigned to his ship by the Rotterdam municipality. He is bemused. He grew up on his parents&rsquo; commercial shipping vessel; living on the water is no big deal in a country with 280 miles of coastline, 3,700 miles of inland waterways, and one third of the land below sea level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Ukrainian people never realized that it is also possible to live on a boat,&rdquo; says the jovial Dutchman. &ldquo;One family actually left in the middle of the night. They got seasick.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former naval engineer relishes telling the history of the M.L.V Castor, clearly aware of its contemporary resonance. It was built just after the Second World War as the Dutch prepared for the Cold War and any potential hostilities from Russia. &ldquo;One of its goals was an evacuation ship for the government and the Royal Family, in case the Russians started throwing atomic bombs,&rdquo; he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the M.L.V Castor has a new incarnation as a museum ship, party boat, and floating hotel. As one of the few sailable vessels from its era, it </span><a href="http://dunkirk-the-movie.com/en/photo/2459"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeared in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s 2017 movie Dunkirk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Rotterdam municipality started preparing for the arrival of Ukrainians, they knew they had to come up with innovative housing solutions. Like many countries in Europe, the Netherlands is facing a housing crisis, with nearly a million new homes needed by 2030. There are already 35,000 refugees from other countries awaiting permanent accommodation, with many living in </span><a href="https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/nl/artikelen/persbericht/vluchtelingenwerk-rode-kruis-en-unicef-slaan-alarm-om-acuut-opvangtekort"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appalling conditions in tents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The first option was to book a lot of hotel rooms,&rdquo; Rotterdam&rsquo;s Vice Mayor, Vincent Karremans, tells TIME. &ldquo;We also started transforming offices that were empty. Then we started bringing them from the hotels to the river cruise ships.&rdquo;</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Max Pinckers for TIME</span><span class="caption" >Julia and Danilo Martyshkina aboard the M.L.V Castor in Rotterdam on April 30.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The M.L.V Castor is one of four river cruise boats that the municipality is hiring for three months to house Ukrainians. It even persuaded a cruise liner to sail one of its vessels into port, and 1,400 Ukrainians are now living aboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karremans says the city&rsquo;s past makes it open to those fleeing war: &ldquo;Only three buildings survived the bombardment in the Second World War. It is part of our history and our DNA. We feel the fate of the Ukrainian people.&rdquo; </span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia is grateful for the welcome she has received from people in Rotterdam, evidence of which is everywhere on the boat: the Officers&rsquo; Mess is littered with donated toys; tubs of toiletries brought by neighbors fill the shelves of the three bathrooms. When Julia started looking for work, the offers flooded in, and now she has three jobs: bartending, waitressing, and working in a karaoke lounge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The municipality funds the catering aboard the Castor, and every day there is a communal breakfast and dinner, served up by Van Parijs&rsquo;s wife Eelke as Ukrainian mothers dodge in and out of the galley to make meals for fussy children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia is in the thick of it. She is a radiant woman, warm and effusive with a smile that makes her look a decade younger than her 35 years. She seems happy and at home on the boat, affectionately chiding the ship&rsquo;s dog Butz, a heavyset brown Labrador who navigates the steep stairwells with considerable more ease than the Ukrainian children do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Julia is not at home, and she is not happy. Behind the smile, there are always thoughts of the war. &ldquo;When I was in Poland, I saw the planes in the sky, and I thought the bombs were coming,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I saw the birds flying above, I could not see that they were just birds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she goes out to her jobs in bars and cafes, she is incredulous that people can be out having a good time, and wants to ask them what they are doing, how they can carry on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ira Koval, a Ukrainian woman who volunteers with the Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation, which existed before the war but has mobilized to help the new arrivals, says she sees the same trauma in many of her compatriots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Life here is like a movie which is being played to you but it is not real,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It is great weather, everything is blooming, it&rsquo;s beautiful, you see people having drinks on the terraces, and you just escaped from bombings. It&rsquo;s an extremely difficult situation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trauma is one of the long-term issues that <a href="https://time.com/6169929/ukraine-orthodox-easter/" >European nations hosting Ukrainians</a> will have to deal with, as is education for millions of children who do not speak the language of the country in which they have sought refuge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The immediate need, however, is housing. Julia and her family must leave the M.L.V Castor on June 16. Nobody yet knows where they will go. There seem to be few plans in place beyond the temporary solutions, but Ukrainians cannot live on boats for more than a few months, and the thousands of people across Europe who have housed Ukrainians in their own homes are starting to feel the strain. Karremans says they are working on solutions, but concedes that they have not found them yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is this next phase of integrating the Ukrainian refugees that may prove the most politically testing for the European Union, and presents the possibility of tensions between the needs of the new arrivals and existing problems in their host nations. In the Netherlands, it is the balance of providing homes for Ukrainians when many Dutch people and refugees from other countries have been waiting years for stable housing. Germany is facing similar housing challenges. In Spain, the government must justify assisting Ukrainians find work when 12% of its population is unemployed. E.U. nations must find ways to navigate these delicate challenges if they are to prevent a backlash and surge in nationalist sentiment.</span></p>

      <description><![CDATA[Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made comments about the Holocaust that were deeply offensive to Jews]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6174152"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2" data-src="https://time.com/6174152/israel-putin-lavrov-holocaust/" data-widget-id="SB_4" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he accepted an apology from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday for controversial remarks about the Holocaust made by Moscow&#8217;s top diplomat.</p>
<p>The two leaders talked over the phone, after which an Israeli statement said Putin had apologized. However, the Russian statement about the call made no mention of an apology. Instead, it said they emphasized the importance of marking the Nazi defeat in World War II, which Russia celebrates on Monday.</p>
<p>Bennett emerged as a potential mediator between Russia and Ukraine shortly after Moscow&#8217;s invasion. But that role was thrown into doubt this week when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made comments about the Holocaust that were deeply offensive to Jews.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Asked in an interview with an Italian news channel about Russian claims that it invaded Ukraine to &ldquo;denazify&rdquo; the country, Lavrov said that Ukraine could still have Nazi elements even though its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn&rsquo;t mean absolutely anything. For some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish,&rdquo; he said, speaking to the station in Russian, dubbed over by an Italian translation.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who has harshly criticized Russia over the invasion, called Lavrov&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;unforgivable and scandalous and a horrible historical error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust,&rdquo; said Lapid, the son of a Holocaust survivor. &ldquo;The lowest level of racism against Jews is to blame Jews themselves for antisemitism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He demanded that Russia apologize, and Israel summoned the Russian ambassador in protest.</p>
<p>Bennett, who has been more measured in his criticism of Russia&rsquo;s invasion, also condemned Lavrov&rsquo;s comments. On Thursday, he said Putin had apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prime Minister accepted President Putin&rsquo;s apology for Lavrov&rsquo;s remarks and thanked him for clarifying the President&rsquo;s attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust,&rdquo; Bennett&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Evoking Russia&#8217;s deeply-rooted narrative of suffering and heroism in World War II, Putin has portrayed the war in Ukraine as a struggle against Nazis, even though it has a democratically elected government and a Jewish president whose relatives were killed in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Israel gained independence in the wake of the Holocaust and has served as a refuge for the world&rsquo;s Jews. The Holocaust and its remembrance remain central to Israel&#8217;s national identity, and the country marked its annual Holocaust memorial day last week. The Nazis and their collaborators killed 6 million Jews during World War II.</p>
<p>Israel has tried to maintain ties with Russia despite the war, in part because Russia has a large military presence in neighboring Syria, where Israel routinely strikes suspected Iranian military targets. Israel and Moscow coordinate their actions in Syria to avoid coming into conflict.</p>
<p>That paved the way for Bennett to be able to try to mediate between the sides in Ukraine, a role he seems to have resumed this week.</p>
<p>Bennett&#8217;s office said he and Putin discussed plans to evacuate civilians from a besieged steel plant in the port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine. That came after a call between Bennett and Zelenskyy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The statement from Bennett said Putin &#8220;promised to allow the evacuation of civilians, including wounded civilians, through a U.N. and Red Cross humanitarian corridor.&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Taiwan Is Abandoning Its Zero-COVID Strategy in Favor of a ‘New Model’ of Coronavirus Containment</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6174132"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6174132/taiwan-covid-strategy/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Taipei is easing COVID-19 curbs even as its daily cases are rising, in a strategy radically different from Beijing&#8217;s zero-tolerance policy that has shut down many Chinese cities and sent the economy into a tailspin.</p>
<p>On May 5, Taiwan recorded more than 30,000 new COVID-19 infections&mdash;crossing that daily threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. The current wave of infections looks to get worse for the island of 23 million, which has so far registered nearly 232,400 cases&mdash;some 215,000 since January&mdash;and 886 fatalities.</p>
<p>Daily caseloads are expected to rise even further because of the Omicron variant. Health minister Chen Shih-chung said earlier that Taiwan was on track to record up to<a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202204270023"  target="_blank"> 100,000</a> new infections daily, much more than the initial projection of 45,000.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Yet, in the face of this spike, the government has signaled a shift in the pandemic strategy it has been following for two years, away from virus suppression characterized by draconian travel restrictions, mask-wearing mandates, and fastidious contact tracing. A month into <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2022/04/08/2003776214"  target="_blank">the launch</a> of a &ldquo;new Taiwanese model&rdquo; of COVID-19 containment, asymptomatic and mild cases are being isolated at home, save for infected children. Close contacts need only be quarantined for three days instead of the earlier 10. Quarantine for arrivals will be cut down from 10 to just seven days.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6155737/hong-kong-covid-china-omicron/" >How Hong Kong Became China&#8217;s Biggest COVID Problem</a></em></p>
<p>Premier Su Tseng-chang said this new approach isn&rsquo;t exactly living with COVID-19, as the virus &ldquo;would not be allowed to spread unchecked.&#8221; But prevention of the virus from spreading is to be balanced with reopening the economy and allowing people to live normally, he emphasized. There would be no stringent lockdowns, Su<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-calls-chinas-covid-lockdowns-cruel-says-wont-follow-its-steps-2022-05-01/"  target="_blank"> told</a> reporters on May 1. Health officials are to focus on minimizing severe cases and maintaining &ldquo;effective control&rdquo; of mild or asymptomatic ones.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Taiwanese Strait, the zero-COVID policy has seen drastic restrictions on normal life. Entire cities in mainland China have been locked down for weeks. Ports and factories have had their operations suspended. Health apps on mobile phones govern access to transport and public facilities. Though curbs are now being loosened in Hong Kong, harsh travel restrictions over the past two years have temporarily reduced the proud aviation hub and freewheeling financial center to a shadow of its former self.</p>
<p>Experts say Taiwan must find its own approach given the highly transmissible nature of the Omicron variant. &ldquo;Any containment protocol has to be dynamically revised according to the situation of the epidemic or other characteristics of this virus,&rdquo; says Chen Chien-jen, who was Taiwan&#8217;s vice-president from 2016 to 2020 and is an epidemiologist by training.</p>

<h2><b>Why Taiwan put off moving away from zero-COVID</b></h2>
<p>Taiwan has successfully fended off COVID-19 outbreaks in the past. The island banned flights from across the strait in January 2020, immediately after the virus was detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Swift tracing of close contacts, mass testing, and a centralized mask distribution system helped Taiwan avoid a lockdown, save for some soft curbs a year ago to control an outbreak of the Alpha variant.</p>
<p>Last summer, Taiwan&rsquo;s COVID-19 response was again put to the test in the face of hundreds of new infections. At the time, the island was struggling to source COVID-19 vaccines and only 3% of its eligible population was vaccinated. New arrivals were required to undergo a 14-day quarantine, and strict contact-tracing policies were imposed on restaurants, stores and other businesses. Taiwan&rsquo;s COVID-19 cases ballooned to around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-extend-covid-19-curbs-schools-stay-shut-2021-06-07/"  target="_blank">11,000</a> by June 2021 and more than 800 people died during the wave.</p>
<p>Taiwan also began rolling out its locally developed vaccines around the same time. Chen tells TIME that a high vaccination rate, and the availability of rapid testing and antiviral therapies, had to be in place before Taiwan could move away from its de facto zero-COVID policy. The island has now vaccinated<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/taiwan"  target="_blank"> 79%</a> of its population, secured some<a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4515535"  target="_blank"> 40 million test kits</a>, and will have obtained<a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202204220014"  target="_blank"> 700,000</a> courses of Pfizer&rsquo;s COVID-19 drug, Paxlovid, by June. Around 180,000 courses have already been distributed to hospitals and pharmacies.</p>

<p>There has been some vaccine resistance among Taiwan&#8217;s elderly. &ldquo;There will still be groups who feel that since they had almost no chance of getting the virus when Taiwan had no cases, [they don&#8217;t] need to get the vaccine now&rdquo;, says Wayne Soon, a history professor at Vassar College in New York, who studies medical ideas and practices in East Asia. But COVID-19 immunization among those aged 75 and above has now reached 72.5%, with nearly 60% in the same age group having received a booster.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, by comparison, only around <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202201/12/P2022011200567.htm"  target="_blank">25%</a> of those aged 80 and above were vaccinated by January, just before a massive surge in infections. This led to many severe cases, overwhelming the health care system. Roughly 9,300 people have died of COVID in the territory, with 98% of those fatalities occurring in the latest, Omicron-driven outbreak. Over <a href="https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/pdf/death_analysis.pdf"  target="_blank">95%</a> of those who died were aged 60 and above.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, too, appears to be walking back its previous zero-COVID protocols, with curbs easing on businesses and travel. Huang Yanzhong, a global health policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations tells TIME that Hong Kong can likewise expect numbers to surge as regulations are loosened, but cases should be asymptomatic or mild&mdash;as are 99% of the cases in Taiwan&rsquo;s current wave of infection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot expect to move away from zero-COVID unless they experience this stage, this feature, this spike in cases, including the severe cases and also the mortality rate,&rdquo; Huang says. &ldquo;But that can be managed. That transition can be achieved [at] a manageable level.&rdquo;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[The son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos is leading the polls to become the next president of the Philippines—thanks in part to misinformation spreading on TikTok]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6173757"></div></div><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular posts on Joey Toledo&#8217;s TikTok account is a 13-second clip of <a href="https://time.com/6162028/bongbong-marcos-philippines-president-popular/" >Ferdinand &#8220;Bongbong&#8221; Marcos Jr.&#8217;s</a> conversation with Juan Ponce Enrile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the 94-year-old</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrile&mdash;who served as justice secretary and defense minister under Marcos&rsquo; father, the Philippine dictator <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960316,00.html" >Ferdinand Marcos Sr.</a>&mdash;claims that the Philippines was so safe under martial law imposed by the elder Marcos that a Filipino could leave his home unlocked, and &#8220;nobody would touch it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video received 92,000 views, and while Toledo has some doubts about Enrile&#8217;s claims (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just sure if [Enrile&rsquo;s] story is 100% percent accurate because he&rsquo;s already old&#8221;), the 27-year-old says he believes Enrile &ldquo;knows what happened during that time.&rdquo; </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal of the video on TikTok, and many others like it, goes a long way to explaining why Bongbong Marcos looks likely to win <a href="https://time.com/6168999/philippines-elections-celebrity/" >the May 9 presidential election</a>&mdash;potentially returning one of the Philippines&rsquo; most prominent dynasties to power more than 35 years after it was ousted following decades of dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the 32 pro-Marcos TikTok creators TIME contacted would not speak on the record. But one, Toledo from Nueva Ecija province, some 69 miles north of the capital Manila, agreed. Typical of many of his peers, he does not believe the well documented history of the Marcos family&#8217;s <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,958727-1,00.html" >human rights abuses and corruption</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working by day as an IT support desk staffer, Toledo has had his account for eight months but says he noticed a big uptick in followers when he began posting pro-Marcos videos. Toledo says he is not affiliated with the Marcos campaign, and is not paid for his content, but many of his posts to his 22,000 TikTok followers contain outright misinformation. One post, a repurposed video, suggests that the Marcos family&rsquo;s vast wealth comes not from the <a href="https://time.com/4442653/philippines-duterte-marcos-heroes-cemetery/" >looting of Philippine public coffers</a>, but from earnings as a lawyer. Another video asserts that Marcos was &ldquo;the best president in the world&rdquo; during his time in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, they offer insight into how Bongbong Marcos has been able to leverage social media to rewrite the history of his father&#8217;s rule in the Philippines. The Marcos family amassed as much as $10 billion in ill-gotten wealth according to the </span><a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/846731468338347772/pdf/438540WP0Box327377B0Star01PUBLIC1.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the dictator, 70,000 &#8220;enemies of the state&#8221; were arrested, 34,000 were tortured, and more than 3,000 killed, according to </span><a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/edsa/infographics/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But through countless TikTok videos, and other social media posts, a false picture of stability and economic growth has been created that leaves many Filipino voters pining for the &#8220;better years&#8221; of the Marcos regime</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcos leads by an unprecedented margin over other presidential contenders in pre-election surveys: Pulse Asia poll conducted in April showed him with a </span><a href="https://www.pulseasia.ph/april-2022-nationwide-survey-on-the-may-2022-elections/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">33-point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over his closest opponent&mdash;opposition candidate Vice President Leni Robredo. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigative reports from Philippine media outlets </span><a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/245402-networked-propaganda-marcoses-rewriting-history/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-yearender-marcos-jr-benefited-most-ele"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VERA Files</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that Marcos benefits from coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media platforms, especially through videos. Alan German, a campaign strategist at Philippine PR firm Agents International, tells TIME that some political content creators are paid as much as $4,700 on a monthly retainer basis&mdash;a small fortune in a country with a $170 monthly minimum wage. Bongbong Marcos, in an April 26 interview with </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/4/26/Bongbong-Marcos-fake-news-trolls.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN Philippines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has denied paying trolls to boost his image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While misinformation is common to social media everywhere, in the Philippines it is especially pernicious. <a href="https://time.com/5505458/facebook-maria-ressa-philippines/" >Facebook can be used data-free</a> on smartphones, but access to the wider internet, including TikTok, costs money. Together with the country&rsquo;s poor digital infrastructure, expensive cellular data and subpar media literacy, Filipinos often have difficulty accessing verified sources of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Facebook remains the dominant social media platform in the Philippines, TikTok has quickly become a widely used source for sharing political news and views in the Southeast Asian nation of 110 million. The Chinese-owned social media company is privately held, so its user data is hard to verify, but a report from </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-tiktok-stats#:~:text=The%20Philippines%20has%2036.0%20million,users%20aged%2018%20and%20above"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataReportal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an independent data aggregator on digital trends worldwide,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found up to 36 million Filipinos use the app. (The same data aggregator reports Facebook has as many as </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2022-essential-facebook-stats-for-q1-2022-v01"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 million users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Philippines.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo says it&rsquo;s fun to make and share pro-Marcos content on the app&mdash;not least because he enjoys getting a rise out of supporters of Marcos&rsquo; rivals. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s just to vex the other party so that they&rsquo;ll have some engagement. You know how Filipinos are: they love clashes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His feckless approach to TikTok may explain why it works so well for him. Jonathan Corpus Ong, a disinformation researcher at Harvard University, says that compared to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, TikTok&rsquo;s algorithm can catapult a user to stardom with just one post in a couple of days. This encourages users like Toledo to create punchy content in bulk in the hopes of winning viral fame. &ldquo;The potential of misinformative content to achieve a &lsquo;viral sensation&rsquo; kind of dynamic is much higher in TikTok than in other platforms,&rdquo; Ong says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristoffer Rada, the public policy head of TikTok Philippines, says that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once a video is flagged for disinformation, TikTok deprioritizes it.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Alex Bowie&ndash;Getty Image</span><span class="caption" >President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos (1917 &#8211; 1989) gives a pre-election campaign speech to supporters in the run up to the Philippine presidential elections of 1986, Manila, Dec. 7 1985.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., was president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. Many celebrate him for projects that survive to this day, including the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the country&rsquo;s longest inter-island bridge. But his two-decade rule was also marred by massive human rights violations, corruption, and stealing from the national treasury. He was ousted in 1986 through a popular uprising, <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960881-1,00.html" >the People Power Revolution</a>, and the Marcos family fled to Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning from exile in 1991, <a href="https://time.com/4583037/philippines-marcos-burial-duterte-human-rights-protest/" >the Marcos family began revising history in its favor</a>, denying allegations of atrocities outright or remaining silent. Family members took up seats in the local government of their home province Ilocos Norte, successfully rehabilitating their image. (The dictator&rsquo;s widow, Imelda, even ran for president in 1998 but eventually withdrew amid low public support.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the Marcos family has leveraged the power of social media to recraft the narrative even more. Political science professor Julio C. Teehankee at De La Salle University in Manila says that Bongbong and the rest of the Marcos family have adapted Marcos Sr.&rsquo;s support networks and vast wealth to create a &ldquo;well-oiled&rdquo; and &ldquo;well-financed&rdquo; social media campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other factors contribute to Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; popularity: Successive governments since the fall of the Marcos regime have failed to address basic social problems. </span><a href="https://psa.gov.ph/poverty-press-releases/nid/165535#:~:text=Among%20families%2C%20the%20First%20Semester,(Tables%201%20and%203)."  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one fifth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Filipinos live below the country&rsquo;s poverty threshold, while the riches are concentrated among businessmen and political families. A </span><a href="https://pidswebs.pids.gov.ph/CDN/PUBLICATIONS/pidspn1818.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a state-run think-tank estimated only around 1.4% of the population are high-income earners, estimated at $43,400 or more annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other factor is the age of the electorate. Around </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/2/8/youth-vote-56-percent-2022.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% of the 65.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registered voters are under 40&mdash;meaning that they either weren&rsquo;t born during the rule of Marcos Sr., or were too young to remember it. Teehankee says that social media, with its mandate to keep content short and succinct, flattens history&mdash;making it easier for myths and disinformation to take hold in the minds of young voters. &ldquo;They do not have any experience or memory or knowledge about the Marcos regime,&rdquo; he says, adding the Millennials and Gen Z appear to be driving much of the support for Bongbong Marcos on social media. Survey firm Pulse Asia also found that 72% of registered voters age 18-24 support Marcos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a tumultuous era in Philippine history, Marcos&rsquo; dictatorship is barely discussed in schools or in </span><a href="https://www.feu.edu.ph/index.php/2022/01/twistedtruths-the-dilemma-of-philippine-history-textbooks/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">textbooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result is that misinformation learned on social media tends to stick&mdash;even when supporters of Bongbong Marcos are confronted with fact-based rebuttals. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say [Ferdinand Marcos] really did steal money,&rdquo; Toledo says. &ldquo;There are a lot of projects built. Some of the money actually materialized.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo believes the fact of the Marcos dynasty&rsquo;s ill-gotten wealth is a falsehood peddled by long-time political rivals <a href="https://time.com/5793685/corazon-aquino-100-women-of-the-year/" >the Aquino family</a>. (After Marcos was ousted, Corazon, the wife of assassinated senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became president from 1986 to 1992 and their son, Benigno Aquino III, was president from 2010 until 2016.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in July 2003 that the $658 million in deposits made by Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda into Swiss bank accounts and foundations was unlawfully acquired. In 2018, Imelda was also convicted of graft related to private foundations she created for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiding unexplained wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Fighting disinformation on TikTok</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some users are crusading against disinformation by creating their own videos that seek to fact-check the historical white-wash. Mona Magno-Veluz, a 55-year-old genealogist and a self-identified history enthusiast, began posting about Philippine historical figures and events in July 2021 to alleviate boredom during COVID-19 lockdowns. On the anniversary of Marcos&rsquo; declaration of Philippine martial law on Sept. 21, she posted a video dispelling the notion that the economy boomed during the dictatorship. She </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JarcgiZgILZqVZfiuT6kaftvlAL6Iq5gazMfBniAEYI/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cited her sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and explained the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sXEMOgybku4j_OcbulPP-N_WG_gFYImOAHOOXNDE2U/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an external Google Docs link in her TikTok&rsquo;s page bio. That video has since had 1.6 million views and over 156,000 likes.</span></p>

<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of the response to her video was positive, Marcos loyalists attacked her in the comments section of her post. Magno-Veluz says many of them &ldquo;weren&#8217;t interested in understanding the economics. They were just there because they felt outrage that I hinted that the martial law era was not our golden years.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already a college student when Marcos was ousted, Magno-Veluz says she was surprised by how passionate Marcos supporters are in asserting that their version of history is more accurate. She says her critics&mdash;most of whom were too young to remember the Marcos regime&mdash;make her feel like &ldquo;being gaslighted by somebody who wasn&#8217;t there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok says it has partnered with the Philippine commission on elections and local broadcast network GMA News in a bid to combat disinformation on the platform. Leading newswire agency Agence France-Presse also partnered with TikTok to fact-check content shared by Philippine users. TikTok notifies those who post misinformation and takes their accounts down. A spokesperson for TikTok tells TIME that it does not share how many videos or posts have been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 70% of Toledo&rsquo;s posts on his political TikTok account now have disclaimers, which lead to the app&rsquo;s landing site for the May 9 polls. The site contains information about voting, but doesn&#8217;t attempt to fact-check false claims. Toledo says he hasn&rsquo;t received any warning from TikTok for promoting disinformation and adds that he is &ldquo;sure&rdquo; his posts &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t fake.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also says that he isn&rsquo;t worried about the shutdown of his account. &ldquo;The information will always be there. My account may disappear, but the information won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For Philippine voters, that is precisely the problem.</span></p>

<p>Gated communities are known for their manicured lawns, swimming pools, and wealthy residents. In Argentina, they&rsquo;re also known as the home of the world&rsquo;s largest rodents.</p>
<p>On a drizzly afternoon in March 2022, a family of nine capybaras&mdash;the larger ones weighing in at around 130 pounds&mdash;huddle together under the hedges that surround a famous soccer player&rsquo;s mansion. Munching intently on the grass, they barely look up when approached by cars or humans. These are just a few of the hundreds of capybaras that have taken over Nordelta, a private neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, over the last two years.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The capybaras have always been present here. For the first two decades after the community&rsquo;s construction in 1999, they kept themselves hidden, coming out only at night and darting from trees to lakes. But that began to change in 2020. With Nordelta&rsquo;s well-heeled human residents confined to their homes by Argentina&rsquo;s long and strict COVID-19 lockdown, its furrier inhabitants thrived. Spreading out across now empty parks, they reproduced rapidly, boosting their numbers by 16% in one year, according to estimates by local scientists. Then, after an unusually dry winter hit Argentina in June 2021, killing much of the grass in public areas, the capybaras got even bolder, crossing roads and venturing into private gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the conflict started,&rdquo; says Marcelo Canton, head of communications for the Nordelta Residents Association. The capybaras&mdash;known as &ldquo;carpinchos&rdquo; in Argentina&mdash;ate up lawns and massacred rose bushes. They caused traffic accidents, knocking delivery drivers from their bikes. Perhaps worst of all, for a country <a href="https://www.infobae.com/2011/09/16/605985-argentina-el-pais-la-region-mas-mascotas-habitante/"  target="_blank">fiercely devoted </a>to pets, the capybaras began to face off with dogs that confronted them on their new territory, causing injuries to both sides. &ldquo;Dog owners were very upset,&rdquo; Canton says. &ldquo;Especially because here, the dogs are mostly French Bulldogs or other small dogs. They can&rsquo;t defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class="image-wrapper no-caption"></figure>
<p>In July, a group of residents went to the press, griping about a capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; and calling for authorities to move the animals out to a nature reserve. The complaints triggered a huge backlash in both Argentine and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/22/argentina-capybaras-giant-rodents-gated-community"  target="_blank"> international media</a>. Viral posts on social media accused Nordeltans of hypocrisy, since their luxury neighborhood is built on the capybara&rsquo;s historic wetland habitat, with some dubbing the animals &ldquo;class warriors.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t help Nordelta&rsquo;s case that capybaras are extremely cute, with goofy rectangular heads and narrow eyes that make them look permanently sleepy.</p>
<p>But for all the anger leveled at Nordelta, the neighborhood does have a real problem on its hands: how do you deal with an influx of wildlife that wasn&rsquo;t there before in densely populated urban space? Cities around the world are increasingly having to answer that question. The expansion of urban areas, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is destroying the forests, wetlands and other ecosystems where animals have historically thrived. And at the same time, cities have become &ldquo;incredibly enriched environments,&rdquo; often containing an abundance of food, water, and shelter compared to their surrounding areas, says Peter Alagona, an environmental historian and author of<em><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520386310/the-accidental-ecosystem"  target="_blank"> The Accidental Ecosystem</a>.</em> The result is that animals losing their natural habitats are increasingly making the city their home.</p>
<p>Nordelta&rsquo;s confrontation with capybaras is just the beginning. Alagona argues that cities are due for a fundamental rethink of their relationship with urban wildlife. &ldquo;We need to start thinking about cities as multi-species communities, as potential refuges for creatures that, in the future, we may not see in natural spaces,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a grand ecological rearrangement taking place and cities are part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>About 15 miles west of Nordelta,</strong> the grass is tall and the air is full of mosquitoes. Wildcats, lizards, and nutria (the capybara&rsquo;s smaller cousin), roam unseen by humans on roughly 750 acres along the Luj&aacute;n River. Graciela Capodoglio, a former teacher, helped to found this nature reserve in Pilar, a suburb of Buenos Aires, in 2003, around the same time that gated communities began to proliferate around the city. Her goal was to use the space to teach city residents about the importance of protecting nature; today, the reserve is one of the region&rsquo;s last natural wetlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all this development, the animals have been corralled into smaller and smaller spaces,&rdquo; Capodoglio says over the hum of bugs and birds. &ldquo;And now, the whole country is suffering from a drought,&rdquo; which further threatens the wildlife here. The clearing of tens of millions of hectares of<a href="https://time.com/amazon-rainforest-disappearing/" > the Brazilian Amazon</a> and other rainforests, mainly for agriculture, has led, in the last few years, to the disappearance of South America&rsquo;s &ldquo;flying rivers,&rdquo; which once carried moisture across the region. The drier conditions, combined with rising temperature due to climate change, have sapped food and water sources for wildlife, and helped to <a href="https://time.com/5895167/brazil-fires-ricardo-salles-environment/" >spread forest fires.</a> In February, as wildfires lapped at the edges of Corrientes in the north of Argentina, newspapers published <a href="https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/incendios-corrientes-fuego-cede-impactan-imagenes-animales-huyen-llamas_0_jPdLaRffUJ.html"  target="_blank">dramatic images</a> of alligators, capybaras, and other animals fleeing the flames.</p>

<p>Capodoglio was &ldquo;furious&rdquo; when she read news stories about the capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; in Nordelta. And again, in January 2022, when similar stories popped up about <a href="https://www.ambito.com/informacion-general/pilar/alarma-los-countries-una-invasion-lagartos-n5353521"  target="_blank">an invasion of tegus</a>&mdash;black-and-white lizards native to the region&mdash;in gated communities near the Pilar reserve. &ldquo;The word invasion drives me crazy! They were here first,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>In pre-pandemic times, people concerned about tegus on their properties would contact animal rescue shelters to take them away. But with those centers mostly closed because of COVID-19, Capodoglio says the reserve received a rush of calls from concerned residents. &ldquo;I try to explain to them that the poor tegu is an inoffensive animal,&rdquo; she says, noting that the lizards, will cut off their own tails to run away from dogs or larger animals that catch them. &ldquo;And it helps you keep rats out of your house! Why do we need to look at all animals as attackers? It&rsquo;s such an anthropocentric view. It pisses me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over in Nordelta, Canton, of the residents association, says that the group that wanted to remove all capybaras from the neighborhood was a minority of about a hundred out of some 45,000. After the media firestorm, he says, a second group of &ldquo;environmentalist residents&rdquo; spoke up, opposing any measures that could affect the capybaras or their urban habitat. &ldquo;Then finally, a third group in the middle came up, who said &lsquo;okay we have to respect the animals, but what are we going to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 2021, that group made their case for some kind of intervention to the wildlife department of Buenos Aires province and in <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/amamos-a-los-carpinchos-la-respuesta-de-los-vecinos-de-nordelta-que-acusan-a-la-provincia-por-la-nid19082021/"  target="_blank">an open letter</a> in the national press. They pointed out that capybaras had been driven almost to extinction by poachers in Tigre, the municipality where Nordelta is located, by the 1990s, and that the creation of the gated community&mdash;where hunters don&rsquo;t venture&mdash;had saved the animals. But, they argued, the area &ldquo;could no longer feed or sustain&rdquo; today&rsquo;s numbers. The province <a href="https://www.infobae.com/salud/ciencia/2021/08/25/cual-es-la-mirada-cientifica-sobre-la-conducta-de-los-carpinchos-en-nordelta/#:~:text=Qu%C3%A9%20dijo%20la%20administraci%C3%B3n%20de,convivencia%20arm%C3%B3nica%E2%80%9D%20con%20la%20fauna."  target="_blank">agreed</a>, based on their observations from a visit in June, that there was an &ldquo;overpopulation&rdquo; problem. They then began to work with the municipal government and the Nordelta residents association&mdash;which acts almost like a local government because of Nordelta&rsquo;s private status&mdash;on a plan to restore &ldquo;harmonious coexistence&rdquo; between capybaras and humans, according to Canton, consulting with capybara experts at Argentina&rsquo;s national scientific research council, and a team of biologists hired by Nordelta.</p>
<p>Limiting capybara numbers is part of the plan. Officials have ruled out the idea of moving some capybaras to nearby nature reserves&mdash;suggested by the residents to bring the population back to the level it stood at five years ago&mdash;on the grounds that they had not learned to fear their natural predators and wouldn&rsquo;t last in the wild, Canton says. And there will, &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; be no culling of the animals in Nordelta, he adds. But capybara vasectomies are on the table. The province is consulting with vets before giving the greenlight for a trial, which would follow a few dominant males and monitor them for several years. A <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/15/deer-wars-and-death-threats"  target="_blank">deer vasectomy program </a>with similar goals in Staten Island has resulted in a <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2021/03/city-releases-new-data-on-controversial-staten-island-deer-vasectomy-program-is-it-working.html"  target="_blank">&ldquo;sizable decrease&rdquo;</a> in the deer population since 2016, but proved controversial among residents and conservationists. &ldquo;That is a mid- to long-term solution,&rdquo; Canton says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the only less natural measure that&rsquo;s under consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, the focus has been on softer measures. First there was an awareness campaign, using newsletters, social media, and outreach to local press to remind residents that capybaras are generally harmless and ideally are dealt with by simply ignoring them.</p>

<hr />
<p>Next, the residents association began creating new habitats for the capybaras inside Nordelta, so they wouldn&rsquo;t need to resort to gardens. The human residents stopped cutting the grass so often in public parks and near lakes, to make it more comfortable for capybaras, and left some areas on the edges of town to go wild. Then they installed three &ldquo;buffer zones,&rdquo; made up of reeds and bushes for the animals to shelter in, at the edges of lakes within the neighborhood. Three more are under development, along with another site at a currently polluted stream that enters Nordelta from the north.</p>
<p>Canton says the creation of these newly rewilded areas has helped keep capybaras away from residents. The real test, though, will come in the next few months, as the dry winter season in Argentina puts pressure on the giant rodents&rsquo; food supply.</p>

<p><strong>As the global conversation</strong> around the importance of preserving biodiversity gets louder, many cities are trying to change their designs to enable humans and animals to share urban space in a climate-changed world. In <a href="http://www.wildwestend.london/"  target="_blank">London</a>, for example, the largest landowners in the central West End district are adding vegetation to roofs, walls and streets to create more of the plants needed by native birds, bees and bats. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/23/how-wildlife-crossings-are-helping-reindeer-bears-and-even-crabs-aoe"  target="_blank">Wildlife bridges</a>, which allow animals to safely cross roads or railways that have divided parts of their habitats, are in vogue in many cities: a network of reindeer viaducts are being built across Sweden, the largest ever animal overpass is <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/01/wildlife-crossing-liberty-canyon-los-angeles.html"  target="_blank">under construction </a>in Los Angeles, and in March Houston <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/03/116688-first-part-houston-land-bridge-opens-public"  target="_blank">opened</a> a &ldquo;landbridge&rdquo; connecting the two sides of its Memorial park, which have been separated for a century. Even buildings are being rethought: last year, it became mandatory for new buildings in New York City to incorporate<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-04/how-to-design-buildings-to-prevent-bird-crashes"  target="_blank"> bird-friendly elements,</a> such as patterned glass to prevent crashes.</p>
<p>The increasing threats of flash floods, heatwaves, and drought are prompting cities to restore green space and trees, which can absorb water and regulate temperature. Local governments should recognize that animals have their own &ldquo;ecosystem services&rdquo; to offer, argues Alagona. Rather than employing companies to exterminate rats, for example, cities could plant more trees that are conducive to owl nesting habits, and manage power lines better to prevent owl deaths. &ldquo;If we have more owls, we definitely have fewer rats,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;By thinking about wildlife and coordinating across different departments, we can create an environment that&#8217;s healthier for everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Thursday, South Korea&rsquo;s spy agency became the first in Asia <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220505000162&amp;np=1&amp;mp=1"  target="_blank">to join NATO&rsquo;s Cyber Defense Group</a> in a move that risks inflaming tensions with regional superpower China.</p>
<p>In a statement, South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it had been admitted as a contributing participant for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), a cyber defense hub established in May 2008 in Tallinn, Estonia, focused on research, training, and exercises in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/6164840/estonia-baltics-russia-defense-putin/" ><em>The Ordinary Civilians in Estonia Preparing to Protect Their Country Against Putin</em></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyberthreats are causing great damage to not only individuals but also separate nations and also transnationally, so close international cooperation is crucial,&rdquo; the NIS said.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>In response, Hu Xijin, the strident editor of Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece <em>The Global Times</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1522062382666682369"  target="_blank">tweeted</a> that the move was an affront to Beijing and even lays the groundwork for war in Asia. &ldquo;If South Korea takes a path of turning hostile against its neighbors, the end of this path could be a Ukraine,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Against the background of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea&rsquo;s admission to the group seems to reflect a hardening resolve among U.S. allies in response to mounting threats from, in principle, Moscow and Beijing, which has <a href="https://time.com/6163807/china-russia-putin-ukraine/" >backed Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s adventurism</a>. On April 29, a spokesman for China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/china-calls-russia-relationship-a-new-model-for-the-world"  target="_blank">hailed</a> ties with Russia as &ldquo;a new model of international relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, whether NATO was motivated by events in Ukraine to finally sign off on South Korea&rsquo;s membership is unclear. The NIS submitted its application to join the group in 2019 and has participated in the two most recent Locked Shields, the world&rsquo;s largest international live-fire cyberdefense exercise. The CCDCOE now has 27 NATO member countries and five non-NATO contributing participants.</p>

<p>Prof. Sean O&rsquo;Malley, a political scientist at Dongseo University in Busan, says South Korea&rsquo;s membership is &ldquo;a culmination of a very slow evolution over the past decade of getting cybersecurity to be recognized as a really serious threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite hosting some of the world&rsquo;s top tech companies, like LG and Samsung, South Korea has been a surprising laggard regarding cybercrime and only launched a <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/National_Strategies_Repository/National%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy_South%20Korea.pdf"  target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> under the <a href="https://time.com/6075235/moon-jae-in-south-korea-election/" >Moon Jae-in</a> administration in 2018.</p>
<p>This is despite South Korea being the principle target of <a href="https://time.com/4781809/ransomware-attack-north-korea-wannacry/" >increasingly frequent cyberattacks</a> from across the DMZ. A crack squad of 6,800 North Korean agents are engaged in fraud, blackmail and online gambling that together generate some $860 million annually, according to the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy in Seoul. Many attacks originate from inside China.</p>
<p>And whether motivated by Beijing&rsquo;s backing of Russia or not, the move does certainly bring U.S. allies closer together. &ldquo;This is just one more arrow in the quiver for the United States and its allies,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Malley. &ldquo;And, of course, this is one more capacity where China would prefer South Korea be as independent as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173831/who-covid-19-deaths/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(London) &mdash; The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 15 million people were killed either by coronavirus or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems in the past two years, more than double the official death toll of 6 million. Most of the fatalities were in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>In a report Thursday, the U.N. agency&rsquo;s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the figure as &ldquo;sobering,&rdquo; saying it should prompt countries to invest more in their capacities to quell future health emergencies.</p>
<p>Scientists tasked by WHO with calculating the actual number of COVID-19 deaths between January 2020 and the end of last year estimated there were between 13.3 million and 16.6 million deaths that were either caused directly by the coronavirus or were somehow attributed to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on health systems, like people with cancer unable to seek treatment when hospitals were full of COVID patients.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The figures are based on country-reported data and statistical modeling but only about half of countries provided information. WHO said it wasn&#8217;t yet able to break down the figures to distinguish between direct deaths from COVID-19 and others caused by the pandemic, but said a future project examining death certificates would probe this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may seem like just a bean-counting exercise, but having these WHO numbers is so critical to understanding how we should combat future pandemics and continue to respond to this one,&rdquo; said Albert Ko, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Public Health who was not linked to the WHO research.</p>
<p>For example, Ko said, South Korea&rsquo;s decision to invest heavily in public health after it suffered a severe outbreak of MERS allowed it to escape COVID-19 with a per-capita death rate around a 20th of that of the U.S.</p>

</em></p>
<p>Accurate numbers on COVID-19 deaths have been problematic throughout the pandemic, as the figures are only a fraction of the devastation wrought by the virus, largely because of limited testing and differences in how countries count COVID-19 deaths. According to government figures reported to WHO and to a separate count kept by Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-69e8cbaebb653a0f1cb65ffe33d9afbd"  target="_blank">6 million</a> reported coronavirus deaths to date.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington guessed there were more than 18 million COVID deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 in a recent study published in the journal Lancet, and a team led by Canadian researchers estimated there were more than 3 million uncounted coronavirus deaths in India alone. WHO&#8217;s new analysis estimated there were more than 4 million missed deaths in India, ranging between 3.3 million to 6.5 million.</p>
<p>Some countries, including India, have disputed WHO&#8217;s methodology for calculating COVID deaths, resisting the idea that there were many more deaths than officially counted.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Indian government released new figures showing there were 474,806 more deaths in 2020 compared to the previous year, but did not say how many were tied to the pandemic. India did not release any death estimates for 2021, when the highly infectious <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-new-delhi-coronavirus-health-f2a4d130a41944720d9f687f7c5e53ce"  target="_blank">delta variant</a> swept through the country, killing many thousands.</p>
<p>Ko said better figures from WHO might also explain some lingering mysteries about the pandemic, like why <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-pandemics-united-nations-fcf28a83c9352a67e50aa2172eb01a2f"  target="_blank">Africa</a> appears to have been one of the least affected by the virus, despite its low vaccination rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the mortality rates so low because we couldn&rsquo;t count the deaths or was there some other factor to explain that?&rdquo; he said, adding that the crush of deaths in rich countries like Britain and the U.S. proved that resources alone were insufficient to contain a global outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a public health specialist at Britain&rsquo;s University of Exeter, said the world may never get close to the true toll of COVID-19, particularly in poor countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have a massive outbreak where people are dying in the streets because of a lack of oxygen, bodies were abandoned or people had to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-india-religion-coronavirus-c644fc9eb09beb04e16d0215a6693886"  target="_blank">cremated quickly</a> because of cultural beliefs, we end up never knowing just how many people died,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Although Pankhania said the estimated COVID-19 death toll still pales in comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic &mdash; when experts estimate up to 100 million people died &mdash; he said the fact that so many people died despite the advances of modern medicine, including vaccines, is shameful.</p>
<p>He also warned the cost of COVID-19 could be far more damaging in the long term, given the increasing burden of caring for people with <a href="https://time.com/6158273/long-covid-19-risk/" >Long COVID</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Spanish flu, there was the flu and then there were some (lung) illnesses people suffered, but that was it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was not an enduring immunological condition that we&rsquo;re seeing right now with COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know the extent to which people with Long COVID will have their lives cut short and if they will have repeated infections that will cause them even more problems,&rdquo; Pankhania said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6173769"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173769/india-heatwave-climate-change-coal/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>A power crisis in India that&rsquo;s delivering hours-long blackouts, halting manufacturing lines and triggering street protests is forecast to continue for months, adding pressure on the nation&rsquo;s economic rebound.</p>
<p>Electricity outages and curbs have spread across more than half of all states and the nation&rsquo;s coal-dominated energy system is expected to come under further strain as power demand tops a recent record high in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Even with a temporary reprieve from a blistering heat wave that&rsquo;s delivered temperatures as high as 46 degrees Celsius (115 degrees Fahrenheit), households and businesses face ongoing disruptions as coal stockpiles shrink at power plants and fuel imports falter on prices that&rsquo;ve surged since the war in Ukraine.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s becoming a difficult situation,&rdquo; Sumant Sinha, chairman of ReNew Energy Global Plc, a supplier of wind and solar power in India, said in an interview. &ldquo;The whole summer will be a test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High coal and oil prices threaten to add to inflationary pressures that prompted India&rsquo;s central bank to make a surprise move Wednesday to lift its key policy rate. Power curbs will also hit India&rsquo;s already faltering rebound in industrial production.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6171213/climate-change-tv-film/" >Imagine If Hollywood Made Realistic Climate Stories</a></em></p>
<p>Production of coal, the fossil fuel that accounts for more than 70% of India&rsquo;s electricity generation, has failed to keep pace with unprecedented energy demand from the heat wave and the country&rsquo;s post-pandemic industrial revival. Logistics snarls, including a lack of railway carriages to transport the fuel from mines to power plants, are exacerbating the shortages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If power supply is curtailed to the industrial sector, it could delay the recovery in the manufacturing sector by at least one more quarter,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, an economist with ICRA Ltd.</p>
<p>Stockpiles at coal-fired power stations have tumbled more than 14% since the start of April, leaving about 100 plants with critical supply levels, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Reserves are forecast to shrink further on high demand, and that&rsquo;ll be followed by a monsoon season from July.</p>

<h2>India faces &#8216;full-blown power crisis&#8217;</h2>
<p>Monsoon rains triggered a previous power crisis last year &mdash; which also caused widespread electricity curbs &mdash; when coal mines and roads were flooded, hampering production and shipments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If coal stockpiles continue to deplete at this rate, we&rsquo;re going to see a full-blown power crisis across the country,&rdquo; said Shailendra Dubey, chairman at the All India Power Engineers Federation, an advocacy body that produces energy policy suggestions.</p>
<p>Electricity demand hit a record 207.1 gigawatts on Friday and is expected to rise to 220 gigawatts within the next two months, according to India&rsquo;s power ministry. Average spot power prices at Indian Energy Exchange have jumped to about 10 rupees (13 cents) a kilowatt hour, almost triple the average in January, and have been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capped</a> by the industry regulator.</p>
<p>At least 16 of India&rsquo;s 28 states have been grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day, Ashok Gehlot, chief minister of Rajasthan, said Monday in a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ashokgehlot51/status/1520962835928739840"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message</a>, before conditions eased in some areas.</p>

<p>The western desert state, a hub for metal smelters to textile factories, last week ordered power supplies to some industries cut by as much as half. Citizens should limit their use of appliances like air conditioners and coolers in homes and workplaces, Gehlot said.</p>
<p>Maharashtra, home to the nation&rsquo;s financial capital Mumbai, is battling worsening blackouts, said S. Maheshkumar, general secretary at Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association. &ldquo;Industries are worried that they may have to cut production and turn down export and domestic orders,&rdquo; he said by phone.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">16 of India&rsquo;s 28 states have been grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day</span>Anger over patchy electricity supplies prompted protests across the northern state of Punjab &mdash; India&rsquo;s top grains producer &mdash; over the weekend, with farmers blockading roads as they appeal for a minimum of eight hours of power a day for agricultural use. Already there are concerns about electricity supply during a paddy sowing season from mid-June, Kamaljeet Singh Hayer, a farmer in the state&rsquo;s Ferozepur district, said by phone.</p>

<p>In the coal mining states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, many industries are cutting output or running back-up generators with expensive diesel. &ldquo;If we have to operate like this, we&rsquo;ll all soon be in the red,&rdquo; said Philip Mathew, president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association.</p>
<p>Opposition party members marched Saturday through streets in Jammu, protesting against six-hour daily outages. Blackouts have struck key population centers including Uttar Pradesh, and even where supplies are slowly improving like in Karnataka and Kerala connections still aren&rsquo;t guaranteed around-the-clock.</p>
<p>While Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government isn&rsquo;t yet facing major new dissent, India&rsquo;s economy is under pressure from high energy prices, rising inflation and the impacts of the Covid pandemic, including low employment, said Shumita Deveshwar, senior director of India research at TS Lombard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These have the potential to become bigger political issues in the longer-term,&rdquo; Deveshwar said. &ldquo;If the coal crisis continues for an extended period, it will add to the pressure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Victory Day is always a big holiday in Russia: It marks the Soviet Union&#8217;s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, a conflict during which more than 8 million Soviet soldiers died.</p>
<p>But this year, as Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine continues, the day will take on new meaning. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, there&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-victory-day-explainer-intl/index.html"  target="_blank">speculation</a> about whether Victory Day will mark <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/putin-speech-may-9-victory-day-russia/629742/"  target="_blank">a turning point</a> in the war that has already killed thousands and forced millions to flee from their homes.</p>
<p>In March, the <em>Kyiv Independent</em> reported that Russian troops were being told <a href="https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1507095376247074826?s=20&amp;t=g2UK3kTdZE9mYLyY1za1ow"  target="_blank">the war must end by May 9</a>, while more recently, U.S. and western officials have openly wondered if <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"  target="_blank">Russia will officially declare war on May 9</a>, escalating what Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted is merely a &#8220;special military operation.&#8221; But on May 1, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said, &#8220;Our military will not artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day,&#8221; the Moscow <em>Times </em><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/02/russia-not-seeking-to-end-ukraine-war-by-may-9-foreign-minister-a77551"  target="_blank">reported</a>.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8220;We will solemnly celebrate May 9, as we always do,&#8221; Lavrov continued. &#8220;Remember those who fell for the liberation of Russia and other republics of the former U.S.S.R., for the liberation of Europe from the Nazi plague.&#8221;</p>
<p>World War II has shaped Putin&#8217;s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war; In justifying the invasion of Ukraine, he claimed he had set out to &#8220;denazify&#8221; the country&mdash;a phrase that many pundits noted is <a href="https://time.com/6154493/denazification-putin-ukraine-history-context/" >inaccurate</a> in this context given Ukraine has <a href="https://time.com/6154139/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-profile-russia/" >a Jewish President</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" ><em>World War II in Europe Ended 75 Years Ago&mdash;But the World Is Still Fighting Over Who Gets to Say What Happened</em></a></p>
<p>World War II has always been central to the Russian state&#8217;s approach to telling the country&#8217;s history. While the Allies marked May 7 as <a href="https://time.com/3845239/victory-day-may-11/" >&#8220;V-E Day&#8221;</a>&mdash;Victory in Europe Day&mdash;to commemorate the Nazis surrendering in Reims, France, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to wait to celebrate until the Nazis surrendered in Soviet-controlled Berlin the next day. By the time the text was signed late at night, it was already May 9 on Moscow time.</p>
<p>As TIME has previously reported, in the 1960s Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev made May 9 a national holiday, <a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" >complete with military parades</a>. Russia&#8217;s first post-Soviet President Boris Yeltsin turned those into an annual tradition; under Putin, hundreds of thousands of spectators have gathered to watch military personnel march alongside tanks<a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1738768_1585965,00.html" > and missiles</a>. Billboards and buses have featured <a href="https://time.com/3852689/ussr-russia-victory-day-wwii-putin-ukraine/" >posters</a> of Stalin for Victory Day. Tens of millions of Russian citizens have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">marched</a> in Moscow carrying portraits of relatives who died in World War II. Ivan I. Kurilla, a professor at the European University of St. Petersburg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">told</a> the New York <em>Times </em>in 2018 that acknowledgement of family sacrifices during the war &ldquo;is probably the only social glue to form a single society&rdquo; in Russia.</p>
<p>But scholars say that often lost in the Victory Day celebrations are hard truths about what Russia&#8217;s victory in the war really meant. &#8220;The Stalin regime was almost as criminal as the Hitler regime,&#8221; scholar Nikolay Koposov <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/webcast-victory-day-and-russias-politics-history"  target="_blank">stated</a> in a Wilson Center webcast in 2020, &#8220;and most Russians do not realize that the war was not for their freedoms but was largely a battle between the two dictators.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pundits in Russia have pointed out that Victory Day has also become about more than just celebrating Russia&#8217;s military achievements in the past; it&#8217;s very much about galvanizing support for Russia in the present and showing off the strength of Russia&#8217;s military forces.</p>
<p>Journalist Andrei Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a> in a 2017 article about the modern-day significance of Victory Day that it&#8217;s &#8220;central&#8221; to Putin&#8217;s view of Russian history, and &#8220;the Great Patriotic War&#8221; has become his nickname for World War II. &#8220;The current regime, which calls itself the sole heir of this victory, uses this achievement to make itself immune to criticism on other issues while justifying its current militarization efforts and excessive state interference in all aspects of life,&#8221; Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;In its official conception, Russia&rsquo;s commemoration of Victory Day in 1945 is only formally an occasion for collectively mourning for Russia&rsquo;s war dead. It has turned instead into an instrument for providing support to the most militarized, bellicose kind of Russian leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the walk-up to Victory Day this year, the United Nations <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/26/1094796253/ukraine-russia-refugees"  target="_blank">says</a> that the Russia-Ukraine war has displaced more than 5 million Ukrainians so far&mdash;and projects it will displace more than 8 million before it&#8217;s done.</p>
