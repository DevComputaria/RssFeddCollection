How often do you feel relaxed and concentrated so you can perform meaningful work that produces value long term for your company? Do you have time to help your team members grow professionally? Do you have your lunch in front of the computer? How often do you miss details that lead to putting off fires that are unnecessary? Do you have time to manage your outsourced services, or do you just hope for the best?</p><p><strong>I hope your answers are that you are doing just fine, so perhaps skip reading the rest of this article! :)</strong></p><p>The best way to have more time that I found is not to work longer hours, or skipping lunch, but <strong>removing inmediately from my view anything that does not require my attention anymore</strong>.</p><p>The benefit of doing this is that I don’t waste time figuring out if a chat message, email, ticket or file needs an answer or additional work.</p><p>If I can see it means there is something outstanding. I can therefore determine what to do next quickly and without effort.</p><p>I have several workstreams running on my computer all workday, and this is what I do:</p><ul><li>Chat. If got what I needed, or provided what was asked, I close the chat.</li><li>Email. If got what I needed, or provided what was asked, I move the email to a folder.</li><li>Calendar. If I received or sent the meeting minutes, I delete the event.</li><li>Tickets. If got what I needed, or provided what was asked, I move it to Closed.</li><li>Browser bookmarks. If I am finished with it, I delete it or move it to a folder.</li><li>Local Storage. If I finish work with the file, I either delete it or move it to Cloud Storage for archival.</li><li>Cloud Storage. If I don’t need the file anymore, I move it to a folder.</li><li>Wiki. If I don’t need the document anymore, I delete it.</li></ul><p>In order to be able to find things fast, I use a uniform list of folders in email, Wiki, and storage:</p><ul><li>Alerts Monitoring</li><li>Application Security</li><li>Asset Disposal</li><li>Asset Management</li><li>Backup and Archival</li><li>Business Continuity</li><li>Compliance Reporting</li><li>Coordination and Segregation</li><li>Deliverables and Reports</li><li>Data Centers</li><li>Identity Management</li><li>Knowledge Management</li><li>Malware Protection</li><li>Network Security</li><li>Patching and Hardening</li><li>Penetration Test</li><li>Reputation Management</li><li>Risk and Maturity Assessment</li><li>Security Awareness</li><li>Security Incidents Management</li><li>Security Incidents Detection</li></ul><h3>My Routine</h3><p>First thing I do, I open all bookmarks in the Toolbar, that opens all the worstreams as I only use application in the browser.</p><p>After that my daily routine is going through Chat, Email, Calendar, Tickets and make progress with items in collaboration with my colleagues, close them or move to folders once completed.</p><p>Sometimes you will find that a chat becomes an Email, or an Email leads to calling for a meeting or creating a ticket. If this happens, I always <strong>keep in view or “alive” one of them and close or archive the other</strong>.</p><p>If a Chat or Email lingers around for several days, it is a good idea to open a Ticket (and close the Chat or Email), because it is often an indication of a task complex enough to require tracking.</p><p>If something has <strong>high priority, I create a bookmark</strong> in the toolbar so it comes to my attention first thing every day.</p><p>If I don’t have anything outstanding, I go through my files and either archive them in the right folder or delete them, likewise with Wiki documents.</p><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p>I find the following benefits from following this habit of killing cruft:</p><ul><li>When I go home I normally don’t leave anything overdue to do. No one is waiting for me to be able to carry on doing their things.</li><li>I feel relaxed and concentrated, which leads to doing better work.</li><li>I have time to spend with my team, share my knowledge and help them grow.</li><li>I have lunch without stress.</li><li>I can pay attention to details that sometimes make a big difference.</li><li>I can find things fast</li><li>I can find the status of task and projects fast.</li><li>I can generate reports easily thanks to the two items inmediately above.</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4ff6657352f9" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-ciso-den/how-this-ciso-kills-the-cruft-4ff6657352f9">How this CISO kills the cruft</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-ciso-den">The CISO Den</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Successful solutions for survival and reproduction are evolved over and over again, with some examples, like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">Carcinisation</a>”, whereas the body plans of crustaceans of different groups converge to a crab-like form being a sample of frequent convergent evolution.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_examples_of_convergent_evolution">List of examples of convergent evolution - Wikipedia</a></p><p><strong>The evolutionary pressure favours solutions that work.</strong></p><p>What to make, in the light of convergent evolution, of the many compliance and risk assessment/management frameworks. Year on year there are more and more of them, which means….</p><p><strong>Those frameworks don’t matter because they don’t provide the value they are supposed to provide</strong></p><p>If a risk assessment method or a compliance framework was providing better results than another, we would see goverments, regulation authorities, standard bodies and professionals adopting those, and combine the properties of the best ones, some “Carcinisation”, for a way to call it. But that is not what is happening, more are created every year, sometimes without any consideration to pre existing frameworks.</p><p>How many times have you seen a cybersecurity incident report say: “The incident happened because they didn’t comply with requirement X” or “The incident happened because there was a mistake in the risk assessment”. I bet ZERO. But if a method was valuable, it would be instrumental for succesful cybersecurity, which means it would often represent the root cause of incidents.</p><p><strong>You will find convergence only in those methods that provide value</strong>. That is why there aren’t many alternatives to OWASP, because OWASP is a good taxonomy.</p><p>Choice is generally speaking good, but not always. Does IATA have multiple “IATA Operational Safety Audit” frameworks? No, because they have one that works for air travel safety worldwide.</p><p>I think if cybersecurity professional adopted Evidence-based Cybersecurity Management we could end up getting some method convergence:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-ciso-den/principles-of-evidence-based-cybersecurity-management-36a2df16519e">Principles of Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Management</a></p><h3>Are you in?</h3><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c60eb86e8260" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-ciso-den/the-curious-absence-of-cybersecurity-carcinisation-c60eb86e8260">The Curious Absence of Cybersecurity Carcinisation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-ciso-den">The CISO Den</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As PCs were not networked in order to install updated OS+Software we had to physically go where the user was, transfer the data in the hard drive using LapLink over the serial port to the fresh computer and take the old computer back to the IT shop.</p><p>Next job, I worked for some time in military bunker with five colleagues who smoked all day long, we were connecting their isolated LANs all over Spain (where I am from), creating what was known as a WAN, which at the time was a thing. I crammed many tools and Novell drivers in a 1.44Mb floppy disk, so I could connect to servers from computers that would not boot by themselves, and saved me many hours and kilometres walking back to the bunker to get yet another floppy to solve a problem with a PC. My line manager was initially unhappy with the time I spent on this, doing things like using WWPACK and PKFIX to compress executables (which was not always successful), but eventually the whole team asked me regularly for my latest swiss knife floppy and I felt vindicated…</p><h3>Networks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*_0fIkfa54XF-DQV-mx5xCg.jpeg" /><figcaption>My saving grace was the phone display</figcaption></figure><p>Then I moved to London and started working for an American bank in the City near Bank tube station. My English was so poor people would tell me their name on the phone and I would not be able to write it down or pronounce it. So I took to call them back so it would be displayed in my phone LED (one of the few that had this feature) and write the name down. Even so, I normally went to the floor where they worked, call the user from a random phone and watch around who would pick up (it was an open floor).</p><p>My following job was in the White City round building of BBC News, where I could see from what was called “Observation Room” one of the last performances of the Spice Girls before they split. BBC News hired contractors using artist contracts, as apparently they could not hire IT contractors bona fide. We created a new LAN and moved over computers over while live, I was surprised you could switch LAN users from switch to switch without them noticing but it certainly works. Then the Incident happened.</p><h3>The Incident</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/650/1*fcWmr44ZPB6HGrokijEbTA.jpeg" /><figcaption>It made the front page</figcaption></figure><p>I had been on the job replacing one network with a better one for some months, and we routinely changed cables on the fly without the user ever noticing anything. On the left side of the switch was the “IN” side of the network and on the right side it was the “OUT” where we would daisy chain switches to more and more remote areas of the building.</p><p>Two particularities of this network prove to be fateful. The application journalists where using used the UDP protocol for efficiency, relying on the network to reliably transmit these packets. Oh, how wrong it is to design something on top of something as UDP that inherently designed NOT te be relied on. A feature called “Spanning Tree” that prevents loops in the network was not used as it was found not to work reliably.</p><p>So I go to make a network change to the periphery of the building… and when I come back to the office, all hell has broken loose. My colleagues scramble to diagnose the network that has gone down, taking with it all the work that had been written (but not saved) by all the journalists of the TV network for almost all they day. They ask me what did I touch, and I naturally say, “nothing” as I have made a change in exactly the same way I have done dozens before.</p><p>Ten minutes later a little voice in the back of my head says: “Changes lead to problems”. So regardless of not being my fault, I reluctantly, under my own initiative, go back to the periphery and roll back the change I made.</p><p>Few minutes later the network shutdown clears, and the journalists can start writing again all the articles they lost.</p><p>That evening I am walking home and it suddenly dawns on me. The network going down was MY FAULT. In the area where I was working the IN and OUT sides where reversed, and by flipping the switch I create a loop and therefore a packet storm that brought the network down.</p><p>Pictures of being sued, fired and deported flash in front my eyes.</p><p>So I call my boss, but he does not pick up. I later learnt he was in an emergency meeting. I leave a message with a full confession.</p><p>Next morning, I find that he was able to blame some misbehaving devices (of another team) for the fault. And the tells me: “You know and I know. This is it”. So I get to keep my job. I guess my honesty was valued, or perhaps my boss considered to set the record straight did not bring any benefit for anyone.</p><p>I sill have the Computer Weekly with the story of “IT problems at TV” for that week.</p><p>A great fuckup, or a great story of IT wisdom trumping self confidence…your choice.</p><h3>Using Irrationality</h3><p>I moved back to Spain and worked for a consulting firm for some years learning Project Management and started becoming interested in information security, moved on to my first infosec job to a different company and got in an interesting project managing a team to two hackers working for a bank, where I got to use tricks lifted from the book “Irrationality, the enemy within”.</p><p>We had ZERO leverage to make the software teams fix vulnerabilities, so they just ignored the team before my arrival. So I thought to myself, no one likes to be worst at anything, what if we compare their performance and send them a monthly report?. That is what we did, and initially did not get much response, but eventually managers decided they did not like to be one the top of the following graph:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P2VGPlf9mOUxPi_UDwqJIg.png" /><figcaption>Higher is worse</figcaption></figure><p>and we got them to <strong>fix vulnerabilities</strong>! Yay!</p><h3>Dunning-Kruger Manager</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FapfwY2rewEmxy23hCW7Ug.jpeg" /><figcaption>Yep</figcaption></figure><p>Some year later I moved back to London and started working for a service company with two London hospitals as clients, doing some good work with CyberEssentials as that was as far as they could go.</p><p>Alas, the IT leader who hired me was replaced by a new person who was right <strong>at the peak of Mount Stupid </strong>regarding cybersecurity. The new leader double guessed me at every turn, and demanded references for everything.</p><p>I spent several months demanding in the strongest possible terms, even putting my job at risk that servers had security patches applied, to no avail.</p><p><strong>Then WannaCry hit, </strong>and one of the first things management decided to do was to shutdown all the email servers.</p><p>Two large hospitals went without email for days, with the consequences you can imagine for the patients and clinicians.</p><p>Wannacry did not propagate via email, but who could bother checking with the Information Security Officer?</p><h3>Other stuff that happened</h3><p>Two fires and one flood of rainwater in data centres come to mind, and a compilation of the best incidents during meetings working at Spanish bank in this short film with script and directions from yours truly:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOm1t8XXuKj8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOm1t8XXuKj8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOm1t8XXuKj8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/93093d3dba1f507d8f4b6cb5b2f0b600/href">https://medium.com/media/93093d3dba1f507d8f4b6cb5b2f0b600/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=10d8bc08207f" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
