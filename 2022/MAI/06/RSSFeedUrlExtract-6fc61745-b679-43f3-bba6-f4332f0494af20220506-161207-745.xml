<p><strong> What to expect in season 3 </strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we all know how season 2 of Upload ended, leaving all the fans on a Cliffhanger and eagerly waiting for the new season. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">By season 2 we can suggest Choak potentially being Nathan’s Killer, and the creator of the show says that there might be 2 different Nathans in season 3. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As of now, there are no trailers regarding Season 3, but we are sure makers would release the trailer soon. By season 2 ending on a Cliffhanger, we can surely tell u season 3 has something more to offer than all its previous seasons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Salman &amp; Katrina Update: </strong>Eid is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in the Bollywood industry, from the Baba Siddiqui Iftar party to Arpita Khan Sharma Eid Party, the occasion of Eid is always huge for celebs.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, top B town celebs gathered at Baba Siddiqui Iftar party and the event was mesmerizing as stars like SRK, Salman, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, Riteish Deshmukh, Genelia Dsouza, and many more were present</p>
<p>And now this week it was Salman Khan’s sister Arpita Khan Sharma and her husband Aayush Sharma threw an Eid Bash for Bollywood stars and literally,</p>
<p>All the A list celebs were present at the event with the likes of Salman Khan, Karan Johar, Deepika Padukone with hubby Ranveer Singh, Kangana Ranaut, Sidharth Malhotra, Kiara Advani, Kartik Aaryan, Shehnaaz Gill, and Sushmita Sen, Karishma Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and to name a few.</p>
<h3><strong>Is Everything All Right Between Salman &amp; Katrina?</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125513" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="Salman &amp; Katrina" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-76.jpg?resize=1140%2C760&amp;ssl=1 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Some astonishing moments came out of the event like Kangna Ranaut posing at the event, it was shocking for many fans to even see Kangna being present at the event after her online banters against Salman and Bollywood, then a sweet gesture of Shehnaaz hugging Salman became the media attention.</p>
<p>But there was a big celebrity missing out on the event and that was Katrina Kaif, who also had a very friendly relationship with Arpita in the past.</p>
<p>So, as long as this thing was noticed, many people started speculating things in the wrong direction for Katrina who has recently married actor Vicky Kaushal, but to put a full stop to the rumors, we have come up with</p>
<p>the reason why she wasn&#8217;t present is that Katrina was with Vicky Kaushal at an undisclosed location where Vicky has been shooting for his film.</p>
<p>So, with that said everything is cool between Arpita, Salman, and Katrina Kaif, and Katrina will also be with Salman in Tiger 3 which will be released in April 2023.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doctor Strange 2 was one of the most-awaited movies by Marvel and it hits theaters worldwide today on 6th May 2022 although the movie was released one day ago in the UK and a few other countries of Europe. The first impression which I have got about the film is it&#8217;s just about Scarlet Witch or Wanda v/s literally every superhero from Marvel Multiverse. And the acting of <a href="https://dailyresearchplot.com/2022/01/11/elizabeth-olsen-expertly-responds-to-rude-question-about-her-sisters-in-resurfaced-clip/">Elizabeth Olsen</a> as a witch and mother is really more than awesome and I think she deserves an Academy Nomination this year.</p>
<p><strong>THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS for Doctor Strange 2</strong></p>
<h2>How Doctor Strange 2 is about Wanda not about Doctor Strange?</h2>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a fan side story, I am always one of the nerdiest fans of Scarlet Witch and hr powers which made her one of the strongest Avengers till the introduction of America Cahvez in Doctor Strange 2. The performance of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda is really overwhelming and I must say you can watch her and feel her presence of her in each and every frame of the movieDoctor Strange 2.</p>

<h3>In the movie, Wanda has fought almost all the characters from MCU and other dimensions</h3>
<p>Wanda has fought almost all the characters in the movie from Doctor Strange to <a href="https://dailyresearchplot.com/2020/10/20/netflix-agent-carter-season-3-who-will-return-in-cast-everything-we-know/">Captain Carter</a> and <a href="https://dailyresearchplot.com/2022/01/02/doctor-strange-2-casting-rumour-about-nicholas-cage-wolverine-and-fantastic-four-introductiondoctor-strange-2/">America Chavez</a> to Captain Marvel. Almost everyone at the same time and this can prove that she is the strongest and most powerful character in the Marvel Universe at the time when the movie takes place.</p>

<p>Her dialogues are just not written I think they came out of her character like when she says <em><strong>&#8220;I’m not going to apologize for the person I’ll become when we first see &#8221; </strong></em>This dialogue shows how strongly she believes in herself and she has not any regrets about her misdeeds, and the same we can feel when we look into her eyes in all the scenes of Doctor Strange 2.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s the best camera work ever have to be done in MCU which happened to be possible just because of the director <a href="https://dailyresearchplot.com/2022/02/28/kirsten-dunst-indicating-something-about-upcoming-spider-man-series/">Sam Raimi</a>, who is known for his chaotic camera works in every scene and moving shots.</p>
<p>The scene where all the characters are trying to stop Wanda is one of my favorites. The pain inside her of losing her sons and love of her life Vision during the <a href="https://dailyresearchplot.com/2020/10/09/avengers-endgame-is-the-movie-where-names-of-avengers-makes-sense/">Avengers: Endgame</a> incident and then again in the WandaVision series had really broken her and we cannot feel wrong for her we can only feel her sadness and I think up to some point we could agree with her every moves.</p>
<p>I must admit that you must watch Doctor Strange 2 (Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) for Elizabeth&#8217;s character Wanda which has been released on 6th May, 2022.</p>
