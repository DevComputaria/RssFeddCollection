      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Britain's international information war strategy was developed years ago</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The growing political feud between Russia and the West has spurred the activation of specialized propaganda and intelligence units. With regards to the Ukraine crisis, experts say one of the most active parties has been the United Kingdom, which in recent years has stepped up its efforts to&nbsp;demonise&nbsp;Russia by waging a full-scale propaganda war.</p>
<p>As an RT analysis has shown, Britain&rsquo;s "HMG Russia Unit," an interdepartmental government organization created several years ago, has acted as a front for soft influence operations against Moscow with the assistance of international consulting organizations.</p>
<p>Up until now, the activities of the operation had not been publicly visible. However,&nbsp;last month&nbsp;publications containing its employees&rsquo; personal information appeared in a number of Russian Telegram channels. It is alleged that the email addresses included in these posts belong to employees of the HMG Russia Unit who are also connected to various other UK government departments, including the Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, military intelligence, MI5, and the Ministry of Defence, as well as American curators attached to the group.</p>
<h3>Prioritized Propaganda</h3>
<p>To begin with, let&rsquo;s explain how a group specifically targeting Russia appeared within the British government, what its purpose is, and what it does.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The government has long recognized the presence of a sustained and significant threat from Russia to the UK and its allies, including both conventional military capabilities and disinformation, illegal financial transactions, influence operations, and cyber-attacks,&rdquo;</em> said a report submitted to parliament by the Office of the British Prime Minister in 2020.</p>
<p>For the British government, Russia has become <em>&ldquo;one of the main priorities from the point of view of national security,&rdquo;</em> it adds.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is why in 2017 the Government implemented the NSC-endorsed (National Security Council &mdash; RT) Russia Strategy, and in 2017 established the cross-Government Russia Unit which brings together the UK&rsquo;s diplomatic, intelligence and military capabilities to maximum effect,&rdquo;</em> the report goes on to say.</p>
<p>According to the British government&rsquo;s own reports, the HMG Russia Unit, which was formally attached to the UK Foreign Office, was primarily tasked with coordinating information and propaganda campaigns aimed against Russia. This can be traced from data <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/842428/Counter_Disinformation_and_Media_Development_Programme.odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> by the British government and, in particular, from a large-scale program financed by the UK Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) that was carried out by the Foreign Office up until 2021 to develop media resources, including in Russian, and so-called "counter disinformation."</p>
<p>The program notes that the United Kingdom is working with a number of partners to improve the quality of public and independent media resources, including Russian-speaking ones, so they can <em>&ldquo;support social cohesion, uphold universal values and provide communities in countries across Eastern Europe with access to reliable information.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The forms of support vary. They include, for example, mentoring by British media staff, consultations on creating broadcast networks, financing of joint productions, and support for regional media projects in Russian.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the coming year we will be investing over &pound;8m in supporting public service and independent media. This will include projects in the Baltic States and Ukraine, as well as regional initiatives,&rdquo;</em> according to a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/842428/Counter_Disinformation_and_Media_Development_Programme.odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a> published by the UK government.</p>
<h3>Contract for Demonization&nbsp;</h3>
<p>However, the HMG Russia Unit&rsquo;s efforts are not limited to coordinating propaganda efforts. From data on the UK government&rsquo;s public procurement portal, it can be seen that it has served as a customer for the Green Finance initiative &ndash; a British-Russian project aimed at promoting sustainable financing for developing institutional ties between Moscow and London in the environmental and economic spheres. The final date for fulfilling the contract is March 31, 2022.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Funds in the amount of &pound;987,600 were <a href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/notice/df3e76b1-9a5c-4029-bdf6-276f06cb0a91?origin=SearchResults&amp;p=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a> by the well-known consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we analyze the UK government&rsquo;s funding allocations targeting Russia, it turns out that in addition to PwC, Moody&rsquo;s Analytics (a Moody&rsquo;s subsidiary) received funds through a specialized non-profit entity named UK Research and Innovation as part of a contract to track companies and individuals that have been sanctioned over the Ukraine conflict. The relevant restrictions are <a href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/notice/bcc78b70-3892-49f6-bf26-6c05de7cb5b9?origin=SearchResults&amp;p=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> on a portal for the placement of UK government contracts.</p>

<p>The involvement of private international consulting companies in promoting the UK agenda with respect to Russia, as well as the post-Soviet space, logically correlates with the HMG Russia Unit&rsquo;s involvement in large-scale projects to demonize Russia&rsquo;s image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this regard, there is a noteworthy letter dated February 7, 2019, addressed to the British investigative journalist Till Bruckner, who had requested data on the activities of the Integrity Initiative from the British Foreign Office. It states that in 2017-2018, &pound;296,500 was earmarked to finance the project, and an additional &pound;1.961 million in 2019.</p>
<p>A response to the journalist&rsquo;s request was received from the HMG Russia Unit. The Integrity Initiative has been flagged as one of Britain&rsquo;s main programs responsible for spreading anti-Russia fakes and waging a propaganda war against Moscow. At the same time, as RT noted back in 2018, the Anonymous hackers&rsquo; collective <a href="https://russian.rt.com/world/article/576125-britaniya-trolli-rossiya-razvedka">published</a> internal documents from the Integrity Initiative that revealed the mechanisms British media networks employ in their subversive work aimed at Russia.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Fake&rsquo; Trendsetters</h3>
<p>British influence networks initially set a certain standard for the West&rsquo;s anti-Russian template, Alexey Martynov, a political scientist who heads the Institute of Newly Established States, said in an interview with RT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;The British are trendsetters, in a sense. The now popular buzzword &lsquo;fake news&rsquo;, the formation of false narratives, the management of media streams &ndash; all this was born in their heads,&rdquo;</em> says the political scientist. <em>&ldquo;Goebbels studied with British military propagandists. What they are doing is military propaganda.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The academic noted that using private consulting companies and rating agencies as tools to influence Russia was a &lsquo;soft power&rsquo; tactic traditionally employed by specialized British agencies.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Any rating agency is created as a tool for manipulating media flows, and other business dimensions grow out of this. They also have access to domestic statistics that are not available to the public,&rdquo;</em> the political scientist said.<em> &ldquo;These mechanisms have been tested since the 1990s, when all data was opened to foreign &lsquo;partners&rsquo;. Then these mechanisms were created &ndash; it is important to have a high ranking with rating agencies, otherwise you won&rsquo;t receive loans.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The UK continues to ramp up its sanctions against Russia. In May it announced another package of restrictive measures, adding more individuals and legal entities from Russia to the list and planning to ban imports of russian oil. In April, London also <a href="https://russian.rt.com/world/news/993556-britaniya-sankcii-rossiya">banned</a> the import of Russian silver, caviar, and wood products.</p>

                            <p><strong>The legislation will make it easier for the US to send unlimited military equipment to Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has confirmed that President Joe Biden will sign the Lend-Lease Act of 2022 on Monday. The legislation will make it easier for Washington to ship more types of weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Biden will sign the legislation on Victory Day &ndash; when the defeat of Nazi Germany is celebrated annually in Russia, on May 9.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The president will sign the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022,&rdquo;</em> Psaki said on Friday, aboard Air Force One en route to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Biden is set to meet manufacturing leaders in the Greater Cincinnati area on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Lend-Lease Act,&rdquo; which was previously used to help the allies during WWII, was revived and backed by the US Congress last week and will allow the US to export unlimited weapons to Kiev.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the bill was approved by Congress last week, it was put together back in January &ndash; more than a month before Moscow recognized the Donbass republics as independent and sent troops into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly condemned the US and its NATO allies for delivering arms to Ukraine, insisting that the inflow of weapons will only prolong the conflict. The Kremlin has also said Western weapons are considered a legitimate target once they enter Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>Since Russia launched its military operation on February 24, Washington has pledged almost $15 billion in military aid to Kiev. Biden has urged Congress to pass his $33-billion Ukraine aid package, which would direct $20 billion toward providing military support for Kiev.</p>

<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Some 75% of respondents oppose the idea of their country joining the US-led military bloc</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The vast majority of Austrians are against becoming part of NATO, a poll has revealed. In a survey conducted earlier this month by Vienna&rsquo;s Institute for Opinion Polls and Data Analysis and commissioned by the Austria Press Agency, 75% of respondents replied in the negative when asked if they thought their country should join NATO, with another 14% in favor of such a scenario.</p>
<p>Of the 1,000 Austrians surveyed, 52% said they believe Vienna&rsquo;s neutrality provides sufficient protection against external threats, while 40% did not share that view. As many as 83% of respondents spoke in favor of closer coordination on security and defense policy among EU member states.</p>
<p>When asked whether they believed Ukraine should be let into the European Union, 46% said they opposed Kiev&rsquo;s accession, with another 38% indicating that they would support it.</p>
<p>Back in 1955, following the pullout of the allied forces from Austria, the Alpine nation proclaimed itself permanently neutral. While sharing borders with several NATO member states, Austria abstained from joining the military alliance all through the Cold War and the years that followed.</p>

<p>Two other European nations which until recently claimed to be neutral &ndash; Sweden and Finland &ndash; recently announced plans to join NATO in light of Russia&rsquo;s assault on Ukraine. According to several polls, public opinion on joining the alliance has undergone a profound shift in both Nordic countries since late February, with the majority of Finns and Swedes now firmly in favor of membership.</p>
<p>The other significant Western European state which lies outside the military bloc is Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late April, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that should Stockholm and Helsinki decide to join the alliance, they<em> &ldquo;will be warmly welcomed, and I expect that process to go quickly.&rdquo;</em> The NATO chief stopped short of giving any precise timeframe, but offered some degree of protection to both nations during the accession process, should Russia try to intimidate them.</p>
<p>Some media outlets reported earlier this month that Finland could file its application as soon as May 12.</p>
<p>Russia has warned Finland and Sweden that it will have to take counter measures should they become NATO members.</p>

<p>Speaking in mid-April, Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, warned Stockholm and Helsinki that joining the military bloc would imply <em>&ldquo;de facto surrender of a part of sovereignty in making decisions on defense, and also on foreign policy.&rdquo;</em> The Russian official also urged the two nations to consider the<em> &ldquo;consequences of such a move to our bilateral relations and the European security architecture, which currently is in a state of crisis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and prime minister who is currently deputy chairman of the country&rsquo;s Security Council, went further &ndash; suggesting that Moscow would deploy its nuclear weapons to the Baltic region should Finland and Sweden join NATO.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A major explosion ripped through Havana&rsquo;s Saratoga Hotel on Friday, destroying multiple floors of the building. So far, the cause of the blast remains unclear and there are no estimates of casualties.</p>
<p>The blast happened at around 11am local time, with witnesses telling local media the explosion <em>"sounded like a bomb."</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hotel is located directly across from Cuba's National Capitol Building, the seat of the country's parliament.</p>

<p>Hundreds of bystanders have gathered on the streets as police and rescue crews begin searching the rubble for survivors.</p>
<p>One witness told CNN Brasil that the hotel, which is one of the most popular in the city, was almost empty due to the pandemic.&nbsp;Some reports suggested a school across the street from the hotel was evacuated following the explosion.</p>

<p>The hotel's website describes it as a luxury hotel located in the historic center of Havana, with 96 rooms, two bars, two restaurants, a spa and gym. The building was originally built in 1880 and remodeled as a hotel in 1933.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A total of 18 Chinese air force planes have entered the island’s air defense zone, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwan has accused the Chinese military of a mass air incursion into the island&rsquo;s air defense zone. A fleet of 18 People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, including two nuclear-capable H-6 planes entered the zone on Friday, Taiwan&rsquo;s Ministry of National Defense said.</p>
<p>The nuclear capable bombers were accompanied by a Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, KJ-500 aerial warning and reconnaissance plane, as well as 12 J-11 and J-16 fighter jets.</p>
<p>The incursion prompted the scrambling of Taiwanese fighter jets and the activation of anti-aircraft missile systems <em>&ldquo;to monitor the activities&rdquo;</em> of the Chinese air fleet. The aircraft, however, did not enter the air space that Taiwan claims as its own. The Chinese military has, so far, remained silent on the run-in with the island&rsquo;s military.</p>

<p>Beijing, which views Taiwan as an integral part of its territory under its &lsquo;One China&rsquo; policy, has regularly flexed military muscle near the island, buzzing it with large aircraft units and sending in warships. Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, when the remnants of the nationalist government fled the mainland after their defeat in the civil war, but never formally declared independence from China.</p>
<p>The island nation has remained a constant source of tension between Beijing and Western nations, primarily the US, that has long proclaimed its commitment to protecting Taiwan&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;independence&rdquo;</em>. Like most countries, the US does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei but enjoys close military cooperation with the island. Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington against cozying up with Taiwan, as it regards any foreign activities around it as a violation of the &lsquo;One China&rsquo; principle and meddling into its domestic affairs.</p>

<p>Military cooperation between Taiwan and the US has been dented by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as Washington raced to deliver more weaponry to Kiev. On Monday, Taiwan&rsquo;s Ministry of National Defense admitted that Taipei&rsquo;s $750 million order for 40 US-made howitzers was <em>&ldquo;crowded out&rdquo;</em> of production lines, with the estimated time of delivery pushed to 2026 at the earliest, rather than starting in 2023 as planned.</p>
<p>Taipei has openly admitted that it has been watching the Ukraine conflict <em>&ldquo;very carefully&rdquo;</em> to learn from it and use Kiev&rsquo;s experience should Beijing opt for a military option to seize control of the island. Beijing, however, has repeatedly said it prefers a peaceful reunification, but has not ruled out the use of force.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think the Chinese government must be thinking or calculating how the US or other major countries are going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help or whether they&rsquo;re going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help. If Taiwan does not have any support, I think that&rsquo;s going to be a green light to aggression,&rdquo;</em> Taiwan&rsquo;s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told CNN on Sunday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The second-most-consumed drug in Europe had a market retail value of over $11 billion in 2020</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Europe&rsquo;s cocaine market is expanding amid <em>&ldquo;unprecedented levels&rdquo;</em> of trafficking and<em> &ldquo;historically high availability,&rdquo;</em> EU agencies said in a report on Friday, warning that the continent is increasingly becoming a hub for the production and trans-shipment of drugs around the world.</p>
<p>The growth in the European market is driven by high levels of production in South America and new production capabilities inside Europ itself, the joint report by Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) said.</p>
<p><strong></strong>This has resulted in <em>&ldquo;record levels of drug availability, rising violence and corruption, and greater health problems&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;across the continent, EMCDDA director Alexis Goosdeel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cocaine is the second-most-consumed drug in Europe after cannabis, with a market value of around &euro;10.5 billion ($11.1 billion) in 2020, the report said. Around 3.5 million Europeans aged between 13 and 64 reported using the drug in the past year. This could grow even more as new types of <em>&ldquo;smokable cocaine products&rdquo;</em> with added health risks appear on the market, it added.</p>

<p>Record amounts of cocaine have been seized on the continent for four consecutive years, with 2020 seeing a 6% rise from 2019. Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain accounted for three-quarters of the European total &ndash; but large quantities were also seized in Italy, Frace, Germany and Portugal, according to the report. Entry points for shipments are also diversifying, with larger amounts being seized in Eastern Europe and Turkey.</p>
<p>The EU report also warned about a <em>&ldquo;small, but steadily growing&rdquo;</em> methamphetamine market in the EU. Methamphetamine, the most widely consumed synthetic stimulant drug in the world, is produced in the region to supply internal and external markets. Europe is also a destination and transit zone for the drug from other production hubs in the Middle East, Africa and South America, the report said.</p>

                            <p><strong>Polish President Andrzej Duda hopes the two nations will “live together on this land” and build “common happiness”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Polish President Andrzej Duda has expressed hope that there will be no border between Poland and Ukraine in the future, calling the two nations &ldquo;<em>fraternal.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking in Warsaw on May 3, the day Poland celebrated its Constitution Day, Duda said he envisaged a time&nbsp;in which the two nations would live &ldquo;<em>together on this land, building and rebuilding our common happiness and common strength that will allow us to resist every danger.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his address, the Polish president apparently echoed a remark made by his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, in early March, when he said &ldquo;<em>effectively we no longer have a border with Poland, with a friendly Poland.</em>&rdquo; The Ukrainian head of state highlighted how welcoming Warsaw had been to Ukrainian refugees, &ldquo;<em>not asking them about their nationality, religion or how much money they have.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fact was mentioned by the Polish president, too, during his speech on Tuesday. He thanked his fellow countrymen and women for showing their kindness to Ukrainian refugees without being prompted &ldquo;<em>by any politicians, by any clergy, by anyone.</em>&rdquo; Duda again cited Volodymyr Zelensky, who recently said that &ldquo;<em>in view of what the Poles have done, the whole history is not important.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Polish president concurred with this assessment, arguing that today&rsquo;s solidarity between the two nations dwarfed all the conflicts of the past. Duda spoke of the opportunity which today&rsquo;s crisis offered for rebuilding a &ldquo;<em>true community in our part of Europe,</em>&rdquo; which would be &ldquo;<em>able to defend itself against any attack.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to suggest that, besides Poland and Ukraine, other nations such as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, should also band together. The Polish president added that it was Warsaw&rsquo;s responsibility to build &ldquo;<em>neighborly ties and brotherhood between our nations.</em>&rdquo; He also pledged to help Ukrainians to rebuild their country &ldquo;<em>when the war is over.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about anti-Russia sanctions, Duda acknowledged that the punitive measures against the Kremlin came at a price for those imposing them, causing &ldquo;<em>economic crashes, crashes in the energy market, in the fuel market,</em>&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;<em>inflation that affects our wallets, which makes our lives more difficult.</em>&rdquo; The Polish president insisted, however, that the international community had no other option but to go ahead with the sanctions regardless to force &ldquo;<em>Russia to stop its aggression.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We have to survive this, we have to pursue a responsible policy, we have to deal with it,</em>&rdquo; Duda told his compatriots.</p>
<p>He condemned the &ldquo;<em>brutal aggression of the Russian power on an independent, sovereign state, an independent and sovereign nation.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Friday that Poland could pose a threat to Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity. The Russian official described this as an &ldquo;<em>obvious fact,</em>&rdquo; citing a recent statement by the head of Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Intelligence Service. Poland had earlier dismissed the allegations made by Moscow&rsquo;s top spy that it planned to take over a portion of Ukrainian territory, calling it a &ldquo;<em>Russian information operation</em>&rdquo; aimed against Warsaw and Washington. Meanwhile, the Polish Ministry of Defense announced earlier this month that it was proceeding with large-scale military drills near the Ukrainian border, starting on May 1. Warsaw, however, insists the exercise has nothing to do with the conflict in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>In an interview with Associated Press on Thursday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, too, alleged that politicians in Poland were harboring plans to occupy western Ukraine, &ldquo;<em>that is, they have the partition of Ukraine in mind.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon its reconstitution in 1919, Poland claimed territories that are now part of Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine, known as Kresy Wschodnie, or &ldquo;<em>eastern borderlands.</em>&rdquo; Cities like Lvov and Stanislavov &ndash; known as Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk in present-day Ukraine &ndash; ended up in the USSR after WWII as Poland&rsquo;s borders were shifted westward to the Oder-Neisse line.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>More than a dozen people have been injured in a blast, authorities in the Spanish capital say</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A powerful explosion has rocked the Spanish capital Madrid early in the afternoon on Friday, with authorities reporting more than a dozen injuries.</p>
<p>The blast occurred at a four-story building in the city&rsquo;s upmarket Salamanca area where construction work had been underway at the time.</p>
<p>The incident left at least 18 people injured, according to medics. Most of them escaped with light wounds, but four required hospitalization, including one in a serious condition.</p>
<p>Two construction workers are reportedly missing. They are said to have been on the third floor when the blast occurred.</p>

<p>The explosion was so powerful that it reportedly threw one man into the courtyard of a nearby house.</p>
<p>The building where the blast took place suffered <em>&ldquo;a lot of damage,&rdquo;</em> with debris also hitting parked cars and the facades of other nearby houses.</p>

<p>Firefighters, who earlier evacuated four people from the building, have been searching the affected floors for more victims.</p>
<p>The police have cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the blast.</p>
<p>According to some media reports, it could have been caused by a gas leak or a boiler malfunction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, TS Tirumurti, has accused the Netherlands of <em>&ldquo;patronizing&rdquo;</em> his country after the Dutch ambassador to the UK publicly scolded New Delhi for abstaining on UN General Assembly resolutions on the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>"Kindly don't patronise us, Ambassador. We know what to do,"</em> Tirumurti <a href="https://twitter.com/ambtstirumurti/status/1522327554627100673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a tweet to Dutch envoy Karel van Oosterom on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tirumurti&rsquo;s tweet came in response to van Oosterom&rsquo;s (now-deleted) warning that India <em>&ldquo;should not have abstained&rdquo;</em> from votes pertaining to Russia and the war in Ukraine and that it should <em>&ldquo;respect the UN Charter.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Despite repeated calls and pressure to join the West in helping to isolate Russia over the Ukraine war, New Delhi has been reluctant to cut ties with Moscow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India has abstained on multiple votes and resolutions at the UN General Assembly this year, including a vote moved by the US in April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over accusations of the killing of civilians.</p>
<p>The Asian giant also abstained from a vote brought by Ukraine and its backers in March, condemning Russia over the humanitarian situation in the country, saying then that the focus should be on the cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ambtstirumurti/status/1522324611941257219?s=20&amp;t=SmITU2hUxGHhY9_lE18R0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> delivered Wednesday at the UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, Tirumurti reiterated India's position that <em>"pursuing the path of dialogue and diplomacy"</em> is the <em>"only way out"</em> of the crisis.</p>
<p><em>"India remains on the side of peace and therefore believes that there will be no winning side in this conflict and, while those impacted by this conflict will continue to suffer, diplomacy will be a lasting casualty,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation has a strong trading relationship with Russia, receiving arms from Moscow in previous agreements between the two sides. It even deemed the current situation an opportunity to broaden cooperation. The country boosted oil purchases from Russia recently, despite pressure from Washington.</p>
<p>Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Mexican president points to how quickly Washington approved billions for Kiev while stalling aid for Central American neighbors</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Mexico's President Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador has roasted the US for its reluctance to aid development in Central America, while swiftly finding billions of dollars to assist Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The US has already approved $30 billion for the war in Ukraine, while we have been waiting since President Donald Trump, asking they donate $4 billion, and as of today, nothing, absolutely nothing,&rdquo;</em> L&oacute;pez Obrador pointed out on Friday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Honestly, it seems inexplicable,&rdquo;</em> the President said, describing the decision being made by the American authorities. L&oacute;pez Obrador, who was speaking in Guatemala, the first stop on his five-day tour of Central America, promised that he was <em>&ldquo;going to continue to respectfully insist on the need for the US to collaborate.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Pentagon press-secretary John Kirby announced last week that Washington has already spent $4.3 billion on supporting the Ukrainian military since 2021.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden urged another $33 billion for Kiev in late April, asking the Congress to approve the spending as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>According to US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Washington's goal in Ukraine was to see <em>&ldquo;Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>L&oacute;pez Obrador has taken a rather balanced stance regarding the Russian offensive in Ukraine. He said he didn't support Moscow's actions as Mexico had itself <em>&ldquo;suffered from invasions,&rdquo;</em> referring to past incursions by the US, France and Spain into the country.</p>
<p>However, he has refused to join the draconian international sanctions imposed on Russia over the conflict. Earlier this week, he again reiterated that Mexico wanted to <em>"remain neutral."</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The former US president suggested a missile attack on Mexican drug labs, an ex-defense secretary says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Former US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has shared in his soon-to-be-published memoirs that in 2020, concerned with increasing drug flows across the southern border, US President Donald Trump considered striking Mexican cartels by launching missiles at their drug laboratories, the New York Times reported on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have control of their own country. We could just shoot some Patriot missiles and take out the labs, quietly. No one would know it was us,&rdquo;</em> the former Pentagon boss quoted Trump as saying.</p>
<p>In 2020, US Customs and Border Protection reported the seizure of 706,800 lb (320 metric tons) of various drugs at the southern border. The Mexican government has been fighting the cartels for decades, and according to Justice in Mexico, a US-based activist group, in 2019 drug-related violence in Mexico claimed the lives of 34,588 people.</p>
<p>Mr. Esper was reportedly left all but speechless when the president shared his idea for combating drug crime in Mexico. The former official wrote that he would have thought it was a joke had he not been staring Mr. Trump in the face.</p>

<p>The former Pentagon chief described Trump as someone not in control of his emotions, calling him <em>&ldquo;an unprincipled person who, given his self-interest, should not be in the position of public service.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The former official says he considered resigning from his post several times but decided to stay so that he could counterbalance the <em>&ldquo;dangerous ideas&rdquo;</em> of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>A Republican politician from Pennsylvania, Mark Esper served as defense secretary for just four months until he was fired by Donald Trump in November 2020, weeks before the presidential election. Back then, media reported that Trump&rsquo;s decision, which he announced in an abrupt Twitter post, had to do with the secretary&rsquo;s refusal to use troops on American streets to counter Black Lives Matter protests.</p>
<p>Esper&rsquo;s book will be published on Tuesday. According to the New York Times, it offers a stunningly candid perspective on key episodes of the Trump presidency, including some that were unknown or underexplored. So far, Donald Trump&rsquo;s team has not commented on the publication.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Missouri and Louisiana Attorneys General have accused the US president of ‘colluding’ with Big Tech to censor information</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Attorneys General from two Republican-led US states, Missouri and Louisiana, have filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, Fox News reported on Thursday. The states are accusing high-ranking officials, including President Joe Biden, of having &ldquo;<em>pressured and colluded</em>&rdquo; with social media companies to censor and suppress information on a number of big stories over the past two years.</p>
<p>Among the officials named as defendants are White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and the President&rsquo;s Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. They, and others, are accused of exerting undue pressure on, or working together, with a number of Big Tech companies such as Meta, Twitter and YouTube to suppress information regarding the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, the origins of Covid-19, and security concerns associated with mail-in voting during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry claim the Biden Administration has been doing so &ldquo;<em>under the guise of combating misinformation.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, describes the&nbsp; administration&rsquo;s supposed efforts to hush up certain information as &ldquo;<em>one of its greatest assaults by federal government officials in the Nation's history</em>&rdquo; on Americans&rsquo; constitutional right to free speech.</p>
<p>The filing goes on to claim that &ldquo;<em>Having threatened and cajoled social-media platforms for years to censor viewpoints and speakers disfavored by the Left, senior government officials in the Executive Branch have moved into a phase of open collusion with social-media companies to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints, and content on social-media platforms under the Orwellian guise of halting so-called &lsquo;disinformation,&rsquo; &lsquo;misinformation,&rsquo; and &lsquo;malinformation&rsquo;.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt explained the decision to file the lawsuit by saying that he would &ldquo;<em>not stand idly by while the Biden Administration attempts to trample on the First Amendment rights of Missourians and Americans.</em>&rdquo;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As outlined in our lawsuit, it’s clear that top officials in the Biden Administration have colluded with social media companies to censor free speech, and we’re working to hold them accountable. Read the full petition: <a href="https://t.co/aTcdFU41iX">https://t.co/aTcdFU41iX</a></p>&mdash; Attorney General Eric Schmitt (@AGEricSchmitt) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGEricSchmitt/status/1522301528639344645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>His colleague from the state of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, went so far as to characterize Big Tech as an &ldquo;<em>extension of Biden&rsquo;s Big Government,</em>&rdquo; which is busy &ldquo;<em>suppressing truth and demonizing those who think differently.</em>&rdquo; Landry compared Joe Biden to Joseph Stalin over the president&rsquo;s policies that allegedly aim to &ldquo;<em>censor free speech and propagandize the masses.</em>&rdquo; The Attorney General said the lawsuit was seeking to &ldquo;<em>ensure the rule of law and prevent the government from unconstitutional banning, chilling, and stifling of speech.</em>&rdquo;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden has been colluding with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BigTech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BigTech</a> to censor free speech and propagandize the masses.

<p>Among the cases brought up in the filing are Twitter&rsquo;s decision to disable the sharing of a 2020 New York Post story revolving around the contents of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop that was recovered from a repair shop in Delaware. The report was later found to be accurate by the Washington Post and the New York Times, the two Attorneys General pointed out.</p>
<p>In a separate instance, Facebook supposedly censored posts suggesting that Covid-19 may have accidentally leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The Attorneys General claim that it was Anthony Fauci who orchestrated an effort to &ldquo;<em>discredit</em>&rdquo; the narrative while &ldquo;<em>exchanging emails with Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, regarding the control and dissemination of Covid-19 information.</em>&rdquo; The campaign only began to wind down after more media outlets started reporting on the viability of the theory, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the filing, YouTube effectively censored Republican Senator Rand Paul and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for calling into question the effectiveness of wearing cloth masks during the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>Another major case where &ldquo;<em>social-media platforms aggressively censored</em>&rdquo; speech, as Schmitt and Landry allege, was the run-up to the November 2020 presidential race. The Attorneys General claim that Donald Trump&rsquo;s concerns regarding the security of mail-in voting were stifled by Big Tech at the time. Trump&rsquo;s tweets were flagged, with a notice directing users to the facts surrounding the practice.</p>
<p>As further proof that the Biden administration has been exerting undue pressure on social media platforms to suppress free speech, the filing mentions Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&rsquo;s statement back in June 2021, where he said &ldquo;<em>we expect more from our technology companies&hellip; We&rsquo;re asking them to monitor misinformation more closely.</em>&rdquo; Moreover, the latest launch of the new DHS disinformation board just goes to show that the current US political leadership is intent on ramping up its &ldquo;<em>campaign of censorship,</em>&rdquo; the Attorneys General warn.</p>
<p>Fox News, which covered the lawsuit filing, reached out to Meta, Twitter, YouTube as well as the White House for comment, but apparently none of them have replied so far.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pentagon has rejects reports claiming US intelligence was used in  alleged Ukrainian strike on warship Moskva</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US didn&rsquo;t provide Ukraine with intelligence that allegedly allowed it to strike Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea flagship Moskva off the coast of Odessa last month, Pentagon press-secretary John Kirby has said, in a statement to media.</p>
<p>He was reacting to a report by the NBC on Thursday, claiming that American officials had helped Kiev's forces to target the vessel.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Ukrainians have their own intelligence capabilities to track and target Russian naval vessels, as they did in this case,&rdquo;</em> Kirby said.</p>
<p>Russia insists that its missile cruiser wasn&rsquo;t attacked, but sank on April 14 after a fire that had broken out on board caused the detonation of ammunition. One sailor was confirmed killed and 27 others are missing as a result of the incident, while 396 other crew members were safely evacuated.</p>
<p>According to unnamed officials who talked to NBC, Kiev had asked Washington to identify a ship sailing on the Black Sea, south of Odessa. The Americans allegedly responded that it was the Moskva and helped confirm its exact coordinates.</p>

<p>The US didn&rsquo;t know that Ukraine was going to attack the Russian ship, and played no part in the decision to carry out the strike that it alleges it made, the sources insisted.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Kirby was forced to deny a quite similar report by the New York Times, which cited unnamed officials as saying that the US had assisted the Ukrainian forces in killing Russian generals by sharing data on the location of their mobile command headquarters inside Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military,&rdquo;</em> the spokesman insisted.</p>
<p>However, Kirby acknowledged that sharing &ldquo;<em>battlefield intelligence to help Ukraine defend their country&rdquo;</em> was part of Washington&rsquo;s assistance to Kiev amid its conflict with Russia, together with weapons shipments and financial injections.</p>
<p>The Pentagon spokesman announced last week that the US has already spent $4.3 billion on supporting the Ukrainian military since 2021.</p>

<p>Moscow has repeatedly stated such help to Kiev only destabilizes the situation on the ground and reduces the chances of reaching peace. Last month, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the US-led NATO bloc of <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

                            <p><strong>US limits Johnson & Johnson's jab to certain adults only, citing potentially dangerous side effects</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited its approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s Covid vaccine to those over the age of 18, pointing to dangerous side effects observed in younger recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The agency announced the move in a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-limits-use-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-certain-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> on Thursday following a review of data, saying the J&amp;J shot (alternatively known as the Janssen vaccine) would no longer be authorized for minors due to <em>&ldquo;rare and potentially life-threatening blood clots.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;After conducting an updated analysis, evaluation and investigation of reported cases, the FDA has determined that the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)... warrants limiting the authorized use of the vaccine,&rdquo;</em> it said, referring to the blood-clotting ailment. It noted that symptoms typically appear <em>&ldquo;approximately one to two weeks&rdquo;</em> after the jab is administered.</p>

<p>Individuals under 18 years old will no longer be permitted to receive the shot, the FDA continued. And even for adults, the J&amp;J vaccine is now recommended only to those <em>&ldquo;for whom other authorized or approved Covid-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate,&rdquo;</em> or who would not be able to receive an immunization otherwise.</p>
<p>While the director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Peter Marks, argued the vaccine <em>&ldquo;still has a role in the current pandemic response&rdquo;</em> in the US and around the world, he said <em>&ldquo;the risk of TTS&rdquo;</em> drove the agency to restrict its use among Americans.</p>
<p>The regulator&rsquo;s latest decision is not the first setback for the J&amp;J jab, whose rollout was placed on a brief <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/520896-fda-pause-johnson-covid-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pause</a> in April 2021 following several blood-clotting cases. While the FDA reapproved the shot after a little more than a week, an advisory body at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) later recommended other vaccines over Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s for all American adults after a review of effectiveness and safety data.</p>

                            <p><strong>Bloc ready to deploy additional forces to the Baltic Sea as soon as Stockholm formally requests to join</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the US-led bloc will&nbsp;carry out new troop deployments near Russia&rsquo;s borders if Sweden requests to join &ndash; even before it&rsquo;s officially accepted into the organisation.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking to Swedish state TV&nbsp;about Stockholm&rsquo;s prospective membership application on Thursday, Stoltenberg <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/stoltenberg-okad-narvaro-av-nato-runt-sverige-och-ostersjon-om-sverige-ansoker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> NATO could immediately leap into action to bolster the country&rsquo;s defenses during the process, which could take up to a year to conclude.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and NATO says that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation from NATO to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;We have different ways of doing it, including through an increased presence of NATO forces in the area around Sweden and the Baltic Sea.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The comments follow weeks of public discussion centered on Stockholm&rsquo;s potential NATO application, as well as that of its neighbor Finland. Though both have remained neutral throughout the military bloc&rsquo;s existence, officials have argued that Moscow&rsquo;s attack on Ukraine in late February has significantly altered their thinking on regional security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington &ndash; NATO&rsquo;s chief military power which effectively leads the bloc &ndash; has spoken positively about membership for both Nordic states, with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoing Stoltenberg&rsquo;s remarks during a Thursday briefing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We are confident that we could find ways to address any concerns either country may have about the period of time between a NATO membership application and the formal accession to the alliance,&rdquo;</em> she <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-offers-assurances-sweden-finland-over-nato-application-2022-05-05/">said</a>, suggesting the United States could offer some form of security guarantee ahead of their formal acceptance into the bloc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Both nations are reportedly set to decide on whether to file applications sometime this month, and while lawmakers in Stockholm and Helsinki have already largely approved the idea, members of Sweden&rsquo;s ruling Social Democratic Party have recently raised objections.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We in the federal board have decided to remain in line with our congressional decisions that Sweden should be militarily non-aligned and stand outside NATO,&rdquo;</em> said Annika Strandhall, the country&rsquo;s climate and environment minister and a prominent member of its women&rsquo;s faction.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Stoltenberg has previously stated Sweden and Finland would be <em>&ldquo;warmly welcomed&rdquo;</em> into NATO, and that their membership could even be fast-tracked, indicating strong support for expanding the alliance to 32 members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moscow has vocally opposed those moves, having long rejected any further eastward expansion of the alliance (Finland&rsquo;s ascension would grow the NATO-Russia border by more than 800 miles). Senior Russian officials have also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-warns-baltic-nuclear-deployment-if-nato-admits-sweden-finland-2022-04-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> that increased military deployments to the Baltic region &ndash; which includes NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Sweden and Finland &ndash; could even trigger the stationing of Russian nuclear and hypersonic weapons to the area to restore <em>&ldquo;balance&rdquo;</em> there.</p>

                            <p><strong>Billionaire will likely take over as the platform’s CEO for a few months after completing the takeover, CNBC says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, billionaire Elon Musk, reportedly plans to run Twitter for a few months after completing his $44 billion acquisition of the social media giant.</p>
<p>Musk will likely take the helm at Twitter temporarily, replacing CEO Parag Agrawal, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/elon-musk-expected-to-serve-as-temporary-twitter-ceo-after-deal-closes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> reported on Thursday, without identifying its sources. Twitter&rsquo;s stock rose on the news, rising 2.6% to $50.36, even as the broader market cratered with its biggest declines in two years.</p>
<p>The report might answer questions about the future of Twitter&rsquo;s leadership under new ownership. Musk has vowed to restore freedom of speech to the platform and has indicated a lack of confidence in the company&rsquo;s board of directors, saying none will have a paycheck from Twitter if his takeover goes through.</p>

<p>Agrawal was promoted to CEO at Twitter less than six months ago, replacing co-founder Jack Dorsey. Reuters reported last month that Musk had lined up a new chief executive to run the company, although that person wasn&rsquo;t identified. Agrawal told employees last month that Twitter&rsquo;s future policies and plans are uncertain under new ownership.</p>
<p>The takeover raised concerns among Twitter employees, media outlets and President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration that Musk will ease censorship of speech on the social media platform. Some Twitter staffers were distraught about the deal, suggesting that the buyer is a <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/07/elon-musk-divides-twitter-staff-daddy-or-racist-demagogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;racist demagogue&rdquo;</a></em> who will take the company in the <em>&ldquo;wrong direction.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Musk, who ranks as the world&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#543d48153d78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">richest</a> person with a fortune estimated at $246 billion, told reporters on Thursday that he&rsquo;s not worried about employees leaving the company because of the takeover. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a free country,&rdquo;</em> he said, adding that anyone who doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-said-isnt-worried-104315493.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can leave</a> of their own accord.</p>

<p>Investment adviser Gary Black suggested last month that Musk could add billions of dollars in value to Twitter by paring the company&rsquo;s workforce. Cutting staffing by 10% would provide enough savings to underpin $10 billion in financing for the buyout, he said.</p>
<p>A public <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001494730/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing</a> on Thursday showed that Musk had lined up more than $7 billion in equity commitments from friends and other investors who want to participate in the acquisition. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison pledged $1 billion. CNBC said even Dorsey may get involved in the deal.</p>

                            <p><strong>At least three people were slashed to death and six injured in the ultra-Orthodox city of Elad</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The celebration of Israel&rsquo;s Independence Day was marred by a suspected terrorist attack at a park in Elad that left at least three people dead and six injured, ratcheting up tensions following a series of deadly incidents in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Two suspected assailants were reportedly involved in Thursday&rsquo;s attack. Although one suspect was allegedly armed with a gun, all of the victims were slashed with an ax or a knife. At least two victims are in critical condition at a nearby hospital, and Israel&rsquo;s United Hatzalah emergency medical service said others were being treated for shock at the scene.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s government declared the incident to be a <em>&ldquo;deadly terror attack.&rdquo;</em> Foreign Minister <a href="https://twitter.com/yairlapid/status/1522292509954744322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yair Lapid</a> said, <em>&ldquo;The joy of Independence Day was cut short in an instant. A murderous attack in Elad shocks the heart and soul.&rdquo;</em> He added that Israel<em> &ldquo;will not succumb to terrorism&rdquo;</em> and vowed that security forces would <em>&ldquo;catch the killers and those who sent them.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: terror attack in Elad, Israel where 6 have been injured and 3 killed. <a href="https://t.co/ZsAHW9V2cI">pic.twitter.com/ZsAHW9V2cI</a></p>&mdash; Adam Milstein (@AdamMilstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMilstein/status/1522277484611448833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The two suspects were still at large as of Thursday night, after fleeing the scene in a vehicle. Security forces blocked off several roads in the area as they launched a manhunt for the attackers.</p>

<p>Moti Tsinvert, a volunteer with Israel&rsquo;s MDA paramedic service, called the attack a <em>&ldquo;massacre and a bloodbath.&rdquo;</em> He told the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-705998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerusalem Post</a>, <em>&ldquo;In all my years as an emergency medicine paramedic, I have not encountered such a severe scene of multiple casualties with significant penetrating injuries &ndash; residents who went out just to breathe fresh air in the park, and their lives ended so harshly.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The latest attack brought the death toll to 19 in a spate of terrorist incidents in Israel and the West Bank since March 21. It also came days after Hamas Gaza chief <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidADaoud/status/1522298959687000069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahya Sinwar</a> urged Palestinians to kill Israelis, saying, <em>&ldquo;Whoever doesn&rsquo;t have a gun, he should prepare his cleaver or his ax or his knife.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hamas praised Thursday&rsquo;s attack as a <em>&ldquo;heroic operation,&rdquo;</em> saying it came in response to Jewish Israelis visiting the Temple Mount holy site earlier in the day. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the incident in Elad, saying that such violence <em>&ldquo;only leads to a further deterioration of the situation.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Pro-abortion activists have published what they say are home addresses of six US Supreme Court justices on a website and urged like-minded people to stage protests there. Launched on Wednesday, the website &ldquo;<em>Ruth Sent Us</em>&rdquo; invites would-be activists to contact the organizers to join in picketing the justices&rsquo; homes and even offers &ldquo;<em>stipends</em>&rdquo; for those who want to get paid to create art skewering the so-called &ldquo;<em>six extremist judges</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Our 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights</em>,&rdquo; the site declares. &ldquo;<em>We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactics.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those interested in joining or leading a &ldquo;<em>peaceful protest</em>&rdquo; outside the homes of the &ldquo;<em>six extremist justices</em>&rdquo; are invited to &ldquo;<em>let us know</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RSU takes its name from the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died of cancer in 2020 and who - according to the website, at least - believed that &ldquo;<em>women deserve trust, black lives matter, love is love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no human is illegal.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The individuals behind&nbsp;<a href="http://ruthsent.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruthsent.us</a>&nbsp;have apparently opted to remain anonymous, hiding behind a Twitter account that dates from 2017. The website itself was set up almost two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Its current content appeared in reaction to a draft Supreme Court opinion written by Justice Sam Alito that would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the cornerstone federal legal decisions declaring and affirming abortion as part of a constitutional right to privacy. The opinion was leaked earlier this week, and while the responsible party has not been found, Chief Justice John Roberts verified its authenticity and promised to find out how the breach - which he condemned a &ldquo;<em>betrayal of the confidences of the court</em>&rdquo; - occurred.</p>
<p>While the Supreme Court has yet to officially rule on the case Justice Alito&rsquo;s draft was referring to, abortion rights activists fear the conservative-leaning court actually plans to follow through with throwing out Roe, long a dream of conservative judges and politicians.</p>
<p>Democrats have alternately lionized Ginsburg for her activism and criticized her for refusing to resign during Barak Obama's presidency, which would have ensured a like-minded replacement on the bench. She died in September 2020, at age 87. President Donald Trump was able to nominate Justice Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement, and get her confirmed shortly before the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>Ginsburg was a strong supporter of abortion rights, and cautioned that they should be adopted through comprehensive legislation, rather than resting on a single court decision from 1973 that the opponents could target for repeal. During a talk on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Ginsburg predicted that the effect of its repeal would be limited to poor women in &ldquo;<em>anti-choice</em>&rdquo; states, reasoning that liberal states would never allow abortion to be banned and wealthy women could always travel to those states - or out of the country if need be - if they wanted the procedure done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as Ginsburg predicted, with abortion now hanging in the balance, &lsquo;red states&rsquo; such as Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona have led the way toward banning it on their territory, while &ldquo;<em>blue</em>&rdquo; California, New York, Connecticut,&nbsp;and the ultra-liberal northern US neighbor Canada have set themselves up as abortion &ldquo;<em>sanctuary states</em>.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Jen Psaki will end her stint as White House press secretary on May 13, reportedly to join MSNBC</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>The Jen Psaki era in the White House briefing room will end next week, as President Joe Biden&rsquo;s press secretary will be replaced by her deputy as she reportedly takes a position on the other side of the podium, at MSNBC.</p>
<p>Karine Jean-Pierre will take over as press secretary on May 13, Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/05/president-biden-announces-karine-jean-pierre-as-white-house-press-secretary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> on Thursday. She&rsquo;s being touted as the first openly gay White House press secretary and the first black woman to hold the position. Biden praised Psaki for her work in the role, making an apparent jab at her predecessors in President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Jen Psaki has set the standard for returning decency, respect and decorum to the White House briefing room,&rdquo;</em> Biden said. <em>&ldquo;I want to say thank you to Jen for raising the bar, communicating directly and truthfully to the American people, and keeping her sense of humor while doing so.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Psaki has been criticized as <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/23/jen-psaki-is-the-condescending-face-of-the-biden-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;tone-deaf,&rdquo;</a></em>&nbsp;haughty and condescending by critics such as the New York Post. For instance, when she was questioned last fall about a supply-chain crisis heading into the holiday season, she sarcastically quipped, <em>&ldquo;the tragedy of the treadmill that&rsquo;s delayed,&rdquo;</em> essentially dismissing the fears of working-class Americans who have bigger worries than not getting their new exercise equipment on time. She was derisively nicknamed <em>&ldquo;Circle Back&rdquo;</em> Psaki by conservatives, based on her penchant for dodging tough questions by promising to <em>&ldquo;circle back&rdquo;</em> later with an answer.</p>
<p>Reports last month that Psaki was negotiating a deal for a job at MSNBC raised ethics concerns, as well as fears among reporters at NBC News that her presence at the sister outlet would <em>&ldquo;tarnish&rdquo;</em> the brand&rsquo;s credibility.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre is a long-time advisor to Biden, having worked on his presidential campaign and as a staffer when he was vice president under Barack Obama. She had a stint as a political analyst at MSNBC and worked as chief public affairs officer at MoveOn.org, a left-wing activist group that was partly funded by billionaire George Soros. Born in Martinique and raised in New York, she also worked on Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaigns.<br /><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553568-psaki-nbc-journalists-concerned-credibility/"></a></p>

                            <p><strong>Russia’s president has apologized to the Israeli PM over controversial remarks made by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Vladimir Putin has issued an apology to Naftali Bennett for Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov&rsquo;s statements during phone talks on Thursday, the Israeli Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office has said. Lavrov made the controversial remarks over the weekend, suggesting that Adolf Hitler may have had Jewish ancestry and that some of the &ldquo;most ardent&rdquo; anti-Semites are Jews themselves.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Prime Minister accepted President Putin&rsquo;s apology for Lavrov&rsquo;s remarks and thanked him for clarifying his attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust,&rdquo;</em> the PM&rsquo;s office said.</p>
<p>While the readout of the talks released by the Kremlin press service did not mention the apology, it said the two leaders discussed the importance of the upcoming Victory Day celebrations <em>&ldquo;for the people of both countries, who carefully preserve the historical truth about the events of those years and honour the memory of all the fallen, including the victims of the Holocaust.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The President of Russia recalled that of the six million Jews tortured in ghettoes and death camps and killed by the Nazis during punitive operations, 40 percent were Soviet citizens,&rdquo;</em> the Kremlin press service noted.<em> &ldquo;In turn, Naftali Bennett highlighted the Red Army&rsquo;s decisive contribution to Victory over Nazism.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The international controversy was sparked by Russia&rsquo;s top diplomat on Sunday as he spoke to Italy&rsquo;s Mediaset media company. Lavrov confirmed that the <em>&ldquo;denazification&rdquo;</em> of Ukraine remains one of the primary goals of the ongoing military operation against Ukraine. A reporter then mentioned that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was Jewish, prompting Lavrov&rsquo;s controversial remarks. The diplomat suggested that Hitler <em>&ldquo;had Jewish blood in him,&rdquo;</em> adding that <em>&ldquo;wise Jewish people say the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Before apparently getting sorted out at the top level, the scandal prompted a brief diplomatic back-and-forth between Russia and Israel. Lavrov&rsquo;s Israeli counterpart, Yair Lapid, strongly condemned the remarks, demanding an apology.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Foreign Minister Lavrov&rsquo;s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,&rdquo;</em> Lapid stated. <em>&ldquo;Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of anti-Semitism.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lapid&rsquo;s statement prompted a response from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which brought up<em> &ldquo;tragic examples of cooperation between Jews and Nazis&rdquo;</em> during the Holocaust, mentioning, among other things, the so-called &lsquo;Judenrats&rsquo; &ndash; Jewish councils established in ghettos that reported to Nazis. Moreover, the Jewish ancestry of any president cannot be a guarantee against neo-Nazis raising their heads, the ministry noted.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[Zelensky] hides behind his ancestry himself and covers with it real neo-Nazis, spiritual and blood heirs of the executioners of his own people,&rdquo;</em> the ministry noted. <em>&ldquo;The Jewish ancestry of a president is not a guarantee of protection from rampant neo-Nazism in a country.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Women’s faction of Social Democrats reportedly wants to stay out of US-led military bloc</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Sweden&rsquo;s ruling political party is reportedly divided on whether to join NATO, as the women&rsquo;s wing of the Social Democrats has called for keeping the country militarily neutral.</p>
<p>Annika Strandhall, the country&rsquo;s climate and environment minister, told Stockholm newspaper <a href="https://www.svd.se/a/eEgb6y/uppgifter-s-kvinnor-sager-nej-till-nato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Svenska Dagbladet</a> that the women&rsquo;s faction of the party opposes joining NATO. The faction has <em>&ldquo;a long history and struggle in matters concerning peace, disarmament, d&eacute;tente and military freedom of alliance,&rdquo;</em> said Strandhall, who is federal board chair of the women&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We in the federal board have decided to remain in line with our congressional decisions that Sweden should be militarily non-aligned and stand outside NATO.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strandhall&rsquo;s comments mark the first major political pushback against a proposal for Sweden to apply for membership of NATO and they come shortly before an assessment on the country&rsquo;s security policy that is due out by May 13. The coalition government is scheduled to decide on the issue by May 24, following issuance of a position paper by the foreign ministry.</p>

<p>Another key figure in the Riksdag, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson, said last month that he will recommend that his right-wing opposition party advocate joining NATO if neighboring Finland applies for membership of the alliance. Akesson has long opposed giving up Sweden&rsquo;s military independence, as have most Swedes, but public opinion began to shift sharply after Russia launched its military offensive against Ukraine in February.</p>
<p>A survey conducted last month by Novus showed that 51% of Swedes favored joining the Western military bloc, the first time the pollster found majority support for a NATO bid. Similarly, a poll by media outlet YLE found that a record-high 62% of Finns favored NATO membership, after past studies showed that most people opposed joining the bloc.</p>
<p>Sweden has a two-century history of military neutrality, having stayed out of wars since 1814. Finland has maintained its neutrality since the end of World War II.</p>

<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has pledged to fast-track approval for Sweden and Finland if the two countries apply to join the alliance. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said last month that a public referendum on the issue won&rsquo;t be necessary if the Riksdag approves the bid.</p>
<p>Some world leaders, such as Chinese officials and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, have suggested that NATO instigated the Ukraine crisis by breaking promises against expanding eastward after the Cold War ended in 1991. Pope Francis said on Tuesday that <em>&ldquo;the barking of NATO at Russia&rsquo;s door&rdquo;</em> could have triggered Moscow&rsquo;s decision to launch its offensive.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Transplanted heart infected with pig virus likely killed recipient of pioneering treatment</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>An American man who died two months after receiving a genetically modified pig heart transplant likely succumbed to a pig virus the transplanted heart was infected with, his doctor revealed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>End-stage heart disease patient David Bennett Sr. died in March, two months after undergoing the interspecies transplant surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.</p>
<p>While he had initially appeared to respond well to the procedure, the first of its kind, his recovery did not last, and a spokesperson for the hospital where he died initially said there was &ldquo;<em>no obvious cause</em>&rdquo; for his passing.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Bartley Griffith, who performed the transplant on Bennett, now believes his death was caused by porcine cytomegalovirus - a preventable infection that is not believed to be able to infect humans. While the pig, supplied by biotech firm Revivicor, was supposed to be free of all pathogens, Griffith told the MIT Technology Review that doctors noticed a &ldquo;<em>blip</em>&rdquo; suggesting the presence of the virus 20 days after the procedure, and the team believes the donor pig was infected.</p>
<p>While the doctors initially ignored the readings, claiming the level of cytomegalovirus was very low and attributing it to an error, Griffith noted that by the 43rd day after surgery his patient &ldquo;<em>looked really funky</em>&rdquo; and had clearly fallen off the pathway to recovery. &ldquo;<em>Something happened to him. He looked infected. He lost his attention and wouldn't talk to us</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It's not certain that Bennett died exclusively because of the cytomegalovirus infection - he was suffering from end-stage heart disease, after all, and treating an infection without triggering the patient's immune system to reject the pig heart entirely required striking a careful balance. The doctors believe they might have hastened his death by giving him human antibodies, blood products that might have damaged the pig organ.</p>
<p>While some doctors worry that xenotransplantation - surgically implanting an organ from one species into another - could set off a new type of pandemic, there was no evidence that the virus that attacked Bennett's heart had spread to any of his human body parts, and Massachusetts General Hospital transplant specialist Jay Fishman said there was &ldquo;<em>no real risk to human</em>s&rdquo; of the virus spreading beyond the donor organ.</p>
<p>However, given that the pig's own immune system was absent and the human recipient was taking immunosuppressive drugs to prevent him from rejecting the transplant, such non-human viruses could be permitted to rage unchecked, destroying the organ in its new host body - or potentially causing other complications.</p>
<p>Aside from the viral infection, the operation was considered to be a success, according to multiple doctors who spoke to MIT Technology Review - the heart recipient did not reject the transplanted organ, which was the critical part of the experiment. &ldquo;<em>It was quite amazing. You go to talk to this gentleman and he's got a pig heart. Literally, he has a pig heart</em>,&rdquo; Griffith, the surgeon who performed the operation, gushed - even while acknowledging that the surgery team was &ldquo;<em>like a blind group of squirrels</em>&rdquo; scurrying around in the dark to manage a condition they didn't fully understand.</p>
<p>The donor pig received 10 gene modifications in total, including the removal of genes that could cause hyper-fast organ rejection. It was also given human genes to facilitate acceptance by the patient's body. Several other biotech firms are likely to advance their own pig-to-human transplants in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Top official tells lawmakers that Washington has a ‘deterrence and assurance gap’ with rivals</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The head of America's nuclear forces has sounded an alarm in Congress, suggesting that Washington&rsquo;s ability to deter attacks by rivals may be lacking amid threats from Russia and a rapid buildup of China&rsquo;s strategic weaponry.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are facing crisis-deterrence dynamics right now that we have only seen a few times in our nation&rsquo;s history,&rdquo;</em> US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) chief Admiral Charles Richard said on Wednesday in a Senate hearing. He reiterated concerns over <em>&ldquo;three-party deterrence dynamics,&rdquo;</em> of which he warned lawmakers in March, citing the Ukraine crisis.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The nation and our allies have not faced a crisis like Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine in over 30 years,&rdquo;</em> Richard said. <em>&ldquo;President [Vladimir] Putin simultaneously invaded a sovereign nation while using thinly veiled nuclear threats to deter US and NATO intervention.&rdquo;</em></p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>Meanwhile, Chinese leaders are <em>&ldquo;watching the war in Ukraine closely and will likely use nuclear coercion to their advantage in the future,&rdquo;</em> the admiral said. <em>&ldquo;Their intent is to achieve the military capability to reunify Taiwan by 2027 if not sooner.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Richard has repeatedly warned of the Chinese nuclear buildup and called for US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration to reconsider funding development of a proposed low-yield, nuclear-capable cruise missile that could be launched from submarines. He reiterated that request on Wednesday, saying the Ukraine crisis adds to the urgency to bolster nuclear deterrence.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The war in Ukraine and China&rsquo;s nuclear trajectory &ndash; their strategic breakout &ndash; demonstrates that we have a deterrence and assurance gap against the threat of limited nuclear employment,&rdquo;</em> Richard said. He added that nuclear forces are the <em>&ldquo;foundation&rdquo;</em> of US capacity to deter attacks.</p>
<p>Biden has proposed a $30-billion increase in US defense spending, to $813 billion, despite the fact that Washington already outspends the remainder of the world&rsquo;s 10 largest military budgets combined. The proposal includes a 92% funding increase for the European Deterrence Initiative, to $6.9 billion.</p>
<p>The STRATCOM commander said budget shortfalls or further development delays would have <em>&ldquo;operational consequences.&rdquo;</em> He added, <em>&ldquo;Weapons program delays have driven us past the point where it is possible to fully mitigate operational risk. In some cases, we&rsquo;re just left to assess the damage to our deterrent.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Canberra is concerned about a ‘secret’ security deal between the Solomon Islands and China, PM says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Australia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged the Solomon Islands' leader Manasseh Sogavare to remain &ldquo;<em>calm</em>&rdquo; after he said his country was being &ldquo;<em>threatened with invasion</em>&rdquo; over a security pact it signed with China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We need to be calm and composed when we deal with these issues</em>,&rdquo; Morrison said on Thursday, insisting the relationship between Australia and the Solomon Islands remained friendly even while acknowledging he was concerned over &ldquo;<em>security</em>&rdquo; in the region following Sogavare&rsquo;s decision to sign the &ldquo;<em>secret arrangement</em>&rdquo; with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sogavare has criticized both the US and Australia&rsquo;s response to the security pact his island recently inked&nbsp;with Beijing, insisting there is &ldquo;<em>nothing to be concerned about</em>&rdquo; and that the island nation is &ldquo;<em>insulted</em>&rdquo; by the West&rsquo;s response to the move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are being treated as kindergarten students walking around with Colt 45s in our hands&rdquo; who &ldquo;<em>need to be supervised</em>,&rdquo; Sogavare complained, insisting his country was being &ldquo;<em>threatened with invasion</em>&rdquo; over the controversial pact and that Australia&rsquo;s response demonstrated a &ldquo;<em>lack of trust</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sogavare said on Tuesday that there had been a &ldquo;<em>warning of military intervention</em>&rdquo; in the Solomon Islands if other countries&rsquo; security goals were undermined. &ldquo;<em>We are threatened with invasion</em>,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;<em>Now, that is serious</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morrison insisted that Australia remained Honiara&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>primary security partner</em>,&rdquo; and that his country trusted the island nation as an equal.</p>
<p>No final version of the pact between the island nation and China has yet been published, though a draft leaked in March mentioned Chinese warships were to be given safe harbor in the islands.</p>
<p>Morrison had previously warned that a Chinese military base in the Solomon Islands would be considered a &ldquo;<em>red line</em>&rdquo; for Canberra, though he did not explain what he would do to prevent it, or how.</p>

<p>The Australian PM dismissed suggestions during the press conference on Thursday that he had damaged the relationship between Canberra and Honiara, arguing he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart on the advice of his country&rsquo;s security agencies. He previously accused China of &ldquo;<em>interfering</em>&rdquo; in the Indo-Pacific region, expressing concern that the cooperation pact could eventually lead to the construction of a Chinese military base in the island nation, 2,000 kilometers away from Australia.&nbsp;<br /><strong></strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Dismayed by Brexit and London’s handling of Covid-19, expats say they feel ‘deep, deep shame’ about their home country</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>UK expats living in EU nations &ndash; frustrated by Brexit &ndash; have grown so disenchanted with their native country that some are even <em>&ldquo;embarrassed to be British,&rdquo;</em> a new academic study has shown.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://migzen.net/site/assets/files/1402/benson_et_al__2022_british_citizens_in_the_eu_after_brexit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, which was released on Wednesday and conducted by Lancaster and Birmingham universities, revealed that Brits living throughout the continent have been alienated by their home country&rsquo;s breakaway from the EU, among other factors. <em>&ldquo;The long tale of Brexit is evident in its continuing impacts both on the way they live their lives and in its lasting significance for their sense of identity and belonging,&rdquo;</em> said study co-leader Michaela Benson, a sociology professor at Lancaster University.</p>
<p>In fact, survey respondents showed far more <em>&ldquo;emotional attachment&rdquo;</em> to their country of&nbsp;residence and the EU than to the UK. About 75% said they are either <em>&ldquo;extremely&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;very&rdquo;</em> attached to the EU, while 59% had such feelings for their country of residence. Only about 30% expressed strong attachment to the UK, including around 7% who said they were <em>&ldquo;extremely&rdquo;</em> attached to their country of origin.</p>

<p>Brexit had a lot to do with the estrangement, the study showed. About 80% of expats said the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU had affected their feelings toward their home country <em>&ldquo;a great deal&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;a lot.&rdquo;</em> Brexit strongly affected past or future migration plans for 41% of respondents. A further 17% said their plans were affected at least moderately by the UK&rsquo;s handling of Covid-19, which respondents described with such terms as <em>&ldquo;shambolic,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;mixed messaging&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;s**t show.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Comments were similarly colorful on expats&rsquo; feelings toward the post-Brexit UK, including <em>&ldquo;deep, deep shame&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;embarrassed to be British.&rdquo;</em> An expat living in Denmark said, <em>&ldquo;Since Brexit, I am disappointed in the UK. I am worried and no longer feel like I have the same affinity for the country. It&rsquo;s a shame because I love home, but the country feels so polarized.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A British woman living in Austria also was troubled, saying, <em>&ldquo;I feel disconnected, like it&rsquo;s a completely different country from how I left it. So much so I feel more connected with my second nationality...&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s embarrassing what&rsquo;s happened in the UK and what continues to happen. It&rsquo;s like watching a house on fire from afar.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benson said the study had found a <em>&ldquo;quite pronounced expression of European identity&rdquo;</em> among the expats. About two-thirds of respondents said they had changed their status since 2016, acquiring citizenship or residency, and most have been living abroad for at least five years. The vast majority (73%) plan to settle permanently in their current place of residence.</p>

                            <p><strong>Three prototype vessels will be built over the next three years, the country’s defense minister has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Australia is seeking to build <em>&ldquo;a new autonomous robotic undersea warfare capability,&rdquo;</em> Minister for Defence Peter Dutton said on Thursday, announcing a new program to develop underwater drones for the navy. The same day, Dutton warned that Australia must <em>&ldquo;prepare for war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The project will be co-funded by the Defence Ministry and Australian subsidiary of Anduril, a US-headquartered company working in the autonomous warfare field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defence and Anduril Australia will co-fund a program to design, develop and manufacture Extra Large Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (XLAUV) in Australia for capability assessment and prototyping,&rdquo; Dutton said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>XLAUVs are cutting-edge uncrewed robotic vessels. They are a stealthy, multi-role, undersea capability, typically between 10-30 meters long, with the capacity to carry various military payloads over long distances.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The submarine drones are expected to <em>&ldquo;complement and enhance the agility and potency of the navy&rsquo;s current submarine and surface combatant force&rdquo;</em> in the Indo-Pacific region, the official explained. The vessels are also expected to provide the force with <em>&ldquo;innovative mission options&rdquo;</em> as they would become a<em> &ldquo;disruptive and difficult undersea problem&rdquo;</em> for any adversary.</p>
<p>The research and development program is expected to run over the course of the next three years, yielding three drone submarine prototypes and, ultimately, <em>&ldquo;resulting in a manufacture ready XLAUV&rdquo;</em>, Dutton said. While the minister did not provide any cost estimates for the program, local media suggested it will require a AU$2 billion Australian dollars (US$1.4 billion) investment.Apart from developing the subsurface drones, the Australian military is also set to procure US-made Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Block 2, Dutton said in a separate statement. It is a modern naval anti-aircraft missile, designed specifically to intercept supersonic maneuvering anti-ship missiles, as well as other aerial targets.</p>
<p>The first batch of missiles have already arrived in Australia for <em>&ldquo;initial integration and testing purposes,&rdquo;</em> according to the minister. They will be used by Australian surface naval vessels.</p>

<p>The announcements come amid growing tensions between Canberra and Beijing in the region, reignited by a security and cooperation treaty inked by China and the Solomon Islands late last month. The treaty had invoked fury of the top Australian officials, with the PM Scott Morrison stating last week that a potential emergence of a Chinese military base on the islands would be a<em> &ldquo;red line&rdquo;</em> for Canberra. The Chinese Defense Ministry, however, denied that it had plans to set up an outpost in the country located just across the Coral Sea off Australia.</p>
<p>On Thursday, during a debate with Shadow Defence Minister Brendan O&rsquo;Connor at the National Press Club ahead of Australia's 2022 federal election, Dutton openly warned that the country must get ready for war as he complained over China&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo;</em> influence across the globe.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If history has taught us anything, it is that when dictators are on the march, you can only preserve peace by preparing for war,&rdquo;</em> Dutton stated. <em>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;re seeing right across the region, in fact right across the world, China&rsquo;s influence into Africa, their influence into broader Asia, their influence into even Europe is quite phenomenal.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>As populism rises in the West, so do crackdowns on narratives that deviate from those of the state</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>When US President Joe Biden announced on April 27 that a new Disinformation Governance Board would serve the Department of Homeland Security, it was just the latest turn of the screw on freedom. This time, it&rsquo;s an affront to citizens&rsquo; right to a diversity of information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to correct inaccurate information, but this new entity seems more oriented towards narrative-policing that cracks down on the interpretation of information rather than the accuracy of it. Headed by a former communications advisor to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Nina Jankowicz, one of the board&rsquo;s first responsibilities will be to address <em>&ldquo;disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the US-Mexico border,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/disinformation-governance-board-russia-us-mexico-border/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to CBS News.&nbsp;Interesting that these two issues &ndash; immigration and foreign conflicts &ndash; are currently viewed as two of Washington&rsquo;s most significant failures, which have given rise to populist dissent. Make no mistake, it&rsquo;s the dissent that&rsquo;s the ultimate target.</p>

<p>The fact that a former Ukraine government spin doctor was viewed as the best person to head up the new initiative tells you everything you need to know about its true purpose. Jankowicz published a book in 2020 whose title suggests that she believes the West to be in an online war with Russia. &lsquo;How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict,&rsquo; <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B088RMM9RH/ref=dbs_a_def_awm_bibl_vppi_i1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portrays</a>&nbsp;Western narratives as truthful and Russian narratives as <em>&ldquo;fake news.&rdquo;</em> Doing so obscures the fact that the mainstream Western media has not been immune to propagating narratives peddled by the state that could retroactively be considered fake news or war propaganda. Meanwhile, Russian media has often provided a platform for those seeking to express &ndash; or access &ndash; dissenting analysis or information that falls outside of the Western media bubble. Clearly, there are some &lsquo;democracies&rsquo; that are bothered by this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appetite of Western nations to ensure that their citizens are only fed information that they control through their own highly concentrated government or corporate subsidized media isn&rsquo;t new. It&rsquo;s just getting more voracious. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because the more authoritarian their agenda becomes, the more populist sentiment increases and gives rise to events such as Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, as well as trends such as opposition to US-backed conflicts, the rise in popularity of various populist political parties in Europe, and demonstrations against pandemic mandates, which just happen to be associated with government-issued QR codes.</p>

<p>Dissent is the enemy of authoritarian ambition. Supposedly free countries have manipulated their citizens into believing that censorship of certain views is for people&rsquo;s own safety and security &ndash; hence why the military in Canada, the UK, and France, and now Homeland Security in the US, are involved in narrative policing. In reality, their efforts seem to be more about ensuring citizens&rsquo; compliance with their own agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fusion of domestic security and disinformation came to light as early as 2016, when the European Parliament grotesquely <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20161010IPR46530/be-aware-of-russian-and-isis-propaganda-warn-foreign-affairs-meps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conflated</a>&nbsp;Islamic terrorist propaganda with Russian media, in what seemed to be itself a propaganda effort to undermine the Russian media by equating these two totally unrelated &nbsp;&nbsp;things.&nbsp;But one by one, Western governments have placed free speech under national security control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>France, for example, handed off responsibility for online information arbitration to its domestic intelligence agency (the <a href="https://www.intelligenceonline.com/government-intelligence/2021/12/13/viginum-and-dgsi-consider-partnering-with-defence-backed-startups-to-fight-fake-news,109710744-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DGSI</a>) and has reportedly considered involving defense-funded startups in the effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada has also turned to its security apparatus to shape Canadians&rsquo; information landscape &ndash; at least twice. The Communications Security Establishment, the country&rsquo;s electronic spying agency, has been tweeting its own interpretations of disputed events occurring in the fog of the conflict in Ukraine as indisputable <a href="https://twitter.com/canadianforces/status/1519678721040519169?s=21&amp;t=ovCw-iOckycqzWeIcYNF2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fact</a>, while routinely <a href="https://twitter.com/cse_cst/status/1518591359485104130?s=21&amp;t=ovCw-iOckycqzWeIcYNF2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denouncing</a> Russia&rsquo;s interpretation as invalid.</p>
<p>But Canada&rsquo;s security establishment isn&rsquo;t at its first rodeo in attempting to prevent citizens&rsquo; thinking from deviating from the state&rsquo;s messaging. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the country&rsquo;s armed forces deployed a months-long, military-grade propaganda campaign, which employed tactics honed during the war in Afghanistan, to mind-bend unsuspecting Canadians towards Trudeau&rsquo;s Covid narrative, CBC News <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6079084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the psychological warfare specialists of the 77th&nbsp;brigade of Britain&rsquo;s armed forces have also worked to shape messaging both in favor of the government&rsquo;s Covid policies and against anything contrary out of Russia. <em>&ldquo;One current priority is combating the spread of harmful, false and misleading narratives through disinformation. To bolster this effort, the British Army will be deploying two experts in countering disinformation. They will advise and support NATO in ensuring its citizens have the right information to protect themselves and its democracies are protected from malicious disinformation operations used by adversaries,&rdquo;</em> Defense Secretary Ben Wallace <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/77-brigade-is-countering-covid-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> last year.&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.rttv.ru:446/owa/redir.aspx?C=RC1YVdTi6xz5uRmVPdgPZj65jZ-NXo8NHwyJ4LgPZRRAWq_F3C3aCA..&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fukdefencejournal.org.uk%2f77-brigade-is-countering-covid-misinformation%2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that public safety and disinformation have suddenly become&nbsp;routinely conflated should be worrisome to defenders of whatever remnants of democracy that we still have left. Terrorism, health and now disinformation have all served as pretexts for the rapid erosion of our freedoms &ndash; all under the guise of protecting us from bad actors. But are we really safer? Or are we just increasingly less free?</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Taipei said it can’t afford excessively pricey military equipment</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwan&rsquo;s Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng has said that Taipei will abandon its plan to purchase new US anti-submarine warfare helicopters produced by Lockheed Martin Corp, saying they were excessively pricey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The price is too high, beyond the scope of our country's ability,&rdquo;</em> the island&rsquo;s defense chief said at a parliamentary hearing on Thursday.</p>
<p>Local media, however, have reported that Washington rejected the sale, in the belief that it was not in line with the island nation&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Washington has failed to deliver on previous contractual obligations to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Despite showering American defense manufacturers with money, Taipei is still awaiting $14.2 billion worth of military equipment that it has already ordered from the US since 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently delayed purchases include Howitzer artillery systems and mobile Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The latter are in high demand as Washington is constantly sending new Stingers as a part of its military aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>But as Washington continues bolstering Kiev with arms, some American lawmakers are increasingly concerned over Taiwan&rsquo;s security and its ability to stand up to China, which considers it part of its territory.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We need to make sure that we provide Taiwan with the assistance that they need so that they&rsquo;re not vulnerable to [Beijing&rsquo;s aggression],&rdquo;</em> US Representative Steve Chabot (R- Ohio) said last month.</p>
<p>The United States has long been committed to protecting Taiwan&rsquo;s independence. Most countries, including the US, do not have official diplomatic ties with Taipei since Beijing considers the island as a part of its territory and is seeking its reunification with mainland China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The tech billionaire’s government contracts and transhumanist aspirations must not be disregarded</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter purchase has thrust the social media censorship debate squarely into the limelight, triggering the left and elating the right. Celebrities and the liberal media were quick to denounce Musk&rsquo;s stance on free speech (which is odd, given that those on the left were the advocates of the First Amendment just a decade ago) and some deleted their Twitter accounts. Conservatives, meanwhile, and anyone who cares about free speech, immediately raised the eccentric billionaire to superhero status. Almost overnight, he went from &lsquo;cool rich guy who values free market capitalism&rsquo; to savior of the First Amendment. And maybe he will be. But let&rsquo;s take a moment to zoom out on the bigger picture. Twitter is not Musk&rsquo;s only darling, and maybe we&rsquo;re placing too much of a burden on one man.</p>
<p>Understandably, without Donald Trump in the White House, regular middle-class Americans long for a hero to disrupt the leftist elite empire. Someone influential, powerful, and brave and who will actually take substantive action is like a godsend to us. And at least on the surface, it appears Elon Musk could fill that role. He&rsquo;s straight forward, seems genuine, and thus far, capable of dealing with the backlash from his enemies. However, Musk is, first and foremost, a businessman who loves building things and creating. When most of us were still playing with blocks, he was already writing code. It remains unclear how he&rsquo;s going to like playing politics in the long term, and social media is inevitably political. While that&rsquo;s not entirely new to the prolific tweeter, politics isn&rsquo;t his usual territory.</p>
<p>The billionaire has already walked back his&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;free speech absolutist&rdquo; </em>comments, explaining that what he really meant was free speech that adheres to the law. Fair enough, but the tweet came across as making him seem a bit less steady on his feet. And he will have to be plenty steady, because he&rsquo;s going to need the proverbial fighting skills of Mike Tyson to handle what&rsquo;s coming next under the Biden regime. After all, the Democrats have made it clear that they want to control all information to Orwellian extremes. Is Elon ready for that? And even if he is, there&rsquo;s really only so much he can do with Twitter. It may be a private company, but private companies are subject to government regulations. The founder of multiple multi-billion-dollar companies, he knows this better than anyone and is no stranger to working with the US government and even seeking its help.</p>

<p>Despite being well known as a believer in a limited, hands-off type of government, Musk has on more than one occasion accepted subsidies from the US government for several of his companies. In addition, SpaceX currently has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-won-two-pentagon-contracts-launch-military-rockets-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two contracts</a> with the Pentagon to launch Falcon 9 rockets in the coming year.</p>
<p>Because of the immense societal changes that the richest man in the world&rsquo;s enterprises could bring to humanity &ndash; up to the possibility of colonizing Mars &ndash; Musk carries some of the weight of the world on his shoulders. With Twitter, he&rsquo;s feeling the pressure to choose a political side. He <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554543-musk-twitter-free-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took</a> to his newly acquired social platform just days ago to tweet that he doesn&rsquo;t like the far left or the far right. Fair enough. But more and more Americans are realizing that big government control over our lives is not necessarily a partisan issue, but a freedom and a human rights issue. Which brings us to Tesla and Neuralink.</p>
<p>In case you aren&rsquo;t paying attention, many Democrats, and a few Republicans, are working hard to make ALL cars electric, which could feasibly open the door to increased surveillance,&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/1522309/how-chinas-electric-car-surveillance-system-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just as it has in China</a>. Once an entire population is digitized, it&rsquo;s an easy next step. I think it&rsquo;s wise to know where Elon Musk would stand on this, and the role Tesla would play. As an aside, it&rsquo;s also worth noting the self-driving aspect of Tesla has another significant impact on humanity. It puts us at an increased dependence on machines, making moot our in-the-moment decision-making skills that we have always used to navigate. This aspect alone deserves more discussion than it gets. We cannot become permanent idle passengers. If we do, we are sitting ducks for top-down government control over our travel.</p>
<p>Then there is <a href="https://neuralink.com/science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuralink</a>, which Musk co-founded with the noble goal of helping quadriplegics communicate. But when it comes to integrating man with machine in the way Neuralink aspires to do &ndash; and especially when it moves beyond a medical purpose, which which Musk has shown the intention to do &ndash; we must pause and ask some questions. Specifically, we need to talk about our bodily sovereignty and privacy. Neuralink&rsquo;s success, like any technology, could be a very good thing, but one that has the potential to be used for the wrong purpose and ultimately abused. Without going into conspiracy-style speculation, it&rsquo;s reasonable to see that AI could very well create a surveillance state on steroids. This matter is surely on the radar of Elon Musk, who has repeatedly named AI among the biggest existential threats to humanity.</p>

<p>For better or for worse, and I do hope for better, Elon Musk will influence the world substantially. He already has. And for the moment, I&rsquo;m relieved that he has the upper hand in the information war &ndash; his power to shape our online dialogue is extraordinary. It&rsquo;s how he uses his influence on multiple fronts that will determine at least some aspects of our collective future. Hopefully, he is aware that many people aren&rsquo;t going to be thrilled with being forced to drive electric cars, especially if they are controlled from a government computer. And it&rsquo;s not far-fetched to imagine that most of us aren&rsquo;t too keen on the idea of integrating our brains with machines. Transhumanism might be a fun idea for guys who spend their days in basements playing video games, but for most people, merging our minds with AI is a hard pass. I&rsquo;d ask him to please consider not what Neuralink can do, but what it should do. We all should ask that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to take Elon Musk at face value and believe he will use the power he wields to act in good faith on behalf of his fellow man. But instead of fictionalizing him into a white knight with superhero powers who&rsquo;s here to save free speech and then the world, I suggest we give the man some space to be human, so we can engage him in a human conversation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Colombia’s most wanted warlord – known as ‘Otoniel’ – will face justice in an American court</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Murderous Colombian drug kingpin and warlord Dairo Antonio Usuga, also known as &lsquo;Otoniel&rsquo;, was extradited to the United States on Wednesday to serve his sentence for drug trafficking, despite objections from his victims.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I want to report that Dairo Antonio Usuga alias 'Otoniel' was extradited; the most dangerous drug trafficker in the world, murderer of social leaders and police officers, abuser of children and adolescents. Today, legality, the rule of law, the Public Force and justice triumph,&rdquo;</em> Colombian President Ivan Duque <a href="https://twitter.com/IvanDuque/status/1521988027664547848?s=20&amp;t=75tPNFTcXkBjRFFpjCQ2Ew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>However, family members of Otoniel&rsquo;s victims disagreed with the president. Prior to the extradition, they had pleaded to keep the notorious criminal in the country so he could be tried for crimes against humanity in a Colombian court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Duque has argued that the drug trafficker will still face justice in Colombia. &ldquo;<em>This criminal was extradited to serve drug trafficking sentences in the United States,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;But I want to be clear that once those are served, he will return to Colombia to pay for the crimes committed against our country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>After a seven-year manhunt, Otoniel was eventually captured near the border with Panama in October. The operation involved 500 soldiers and 22 helicopters. Prior to his arrest, Washington had offered a $5 million bounty for the warlord&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>A leader of the notorious narcotics-trafficking Gulf Clan, Usuga stands accused of bringing at least 73 tons of cocaine into the US between 2003 and 2012. The Gulf Clan is believed to be one of the biggest exporters of cocaine in the world. Otoniel&rsquo;s arrest was seen as the biggest blow to Colombia&rsquo;s drug trafficking business since the assassination of Pablo Escobar in 1993.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Washington has no right to tell its citizens what the truth is, Rand Paul claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Due to its long track record of disinformation, the US government has no right to tell the American people what the truth is, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has stated. He went to list a number of examples of where Washington had lied to its own people, and the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Paul grilled Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas over the so-called &lsquo;Disinformation Governance Board&rsquo; his agency has announced&nbsp;to supposedly help social media platforms filter out &lsquo;fake news.&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the problem: we can&rsquo;t even agree what disinformation is,&rdquo;</em> the Republican Senator pointed out. <em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even agree if it was disinformation that the Russians fed information to the Steele dossier.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He was referring to the controversial and largely discredited&nbsp;report that relied on info from anonymous sources to allege collusion between the Donald Trump campaign and Moscow ahead of the 2016 presidential election in the US.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t agree to that, how are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation, so that you can police it on social media?&rdquo;</em> Paul wondered.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The US government!&rdquo;</em> he insisted.</p>
<p>In order to back his claim, the Senator mentioned several examples of false information being deliberately spread by Washington over the past decades.</p>
<p>Among them were the so-called Pentagon Papers, which revealed that the US government had been misinforming the public about the scale of its military operations during the Vietnam War. The documents were officially declassified in 2011, but the media had been reporting on them since 1971.</p>
<p>Paul also mentioned <em>&ldquo;George W. Bush and the weapons of mass destruction,&rdquo;</em> referring to American claims that Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime had been in possession of WMD, claims that were used by the US to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but were never confirmed by findings on the grounds.</p>
<p>His other example was the Iran&ndash;Contra affair, which saw top US officials secretly organizing the sale of weapons to Iran in violation of an arms embargo between 1981 and 1986 in order to obtain money to fund the Contras insurgent group in Nicaragua.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I mean, think over all the debates and disputes we&rsquo;ve had over the last 50 years in our country. We work them out by debating them. We don&rsquo;t work them out by the government being the arbiter,&rdquo;</em> the Senator said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I want you to have nothing to do with speech... You think the American people are so stupid they need you to tell them what the truth is?&rdquo;</em> Paul added.</p>
<p>The creation of the Disinformation Governance Board was announced in late April. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the new body would help counter disinformation, which is being spread by <em>&ldquo;foreign states such as Russia, China and Iran,&rdquo;</em> and by human traffickers operating on the US-Mexico border, among others.</p>
<p>The DHS gave assurances that it won&rsquo;t be targeting US citizens. But critics were quick to nickname the board &lsquo;The Ministry of Truth,&rsquo; after a fictional organization from George Orwell&rsquo;s iconic dystopian novel &lsquo;1984&rsquo;.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Streaming service executives are accused of lying about the company’s growth</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Netflix shareholders filed a lawsuit against the streaming service on Wednesday, accusing the company&rsquo;s management of fraud by issuing misleading guidance about subscriber growth, leading to a plunge in its stock price.</p>
<p>Filed in San Francisco, the lawsuit argues that the streaming service has failed to disclose that it is <em>&ldquo;losing subscribers on a net basis.&rdquo;</em> Unaware of Netflix&rsquo;s inability to retain customers, the plaintiffs claim to <em>&ldquo;have suffered significant losses and damages.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The allegedly defrauded investors believe that the largest streaming service in the world is experiencing a downfall primarily due to account sharing by its customers and increased competition from other streaming services.</p>

<p>Last month, Netflix reported that it had already lost nearly 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 and it expects to lose two million more in the coming months. As a result, within hours of trading the company&rsquo;s shares dropped by 25%. Overall, Netflix&rsquo;s capitalization has decreased by 40% this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unprecedented collapse of the company&rsquo;s value has forced Netflix&rsquo;s executives to consider creating more affordable subscription tiers by adding a version of the streaming platform with ads.</p>
<p>On March 6, Netflix announced that it would leave the Russian market due to Moscow&rsquo;s military action in Ukraine. While the company said it gained 500,000 new subscribers so far this year in other countries, the loss of Russia&rsquo;s 700,000 subscribers has created significant problems for the American entertainment giant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Pentagon reportedly said hundreds of Ukrainian service members are being trained in Europe by American instructors</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US is stepping up its training program aimed at familiarizing more Ukrainian troops with the American-made weapons being supplied to Kiev by Washington, The Hill reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Pentagon officials.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, hundreds of Ukrainian service members are currently being trained by American instructors in a number of European countries, where they are acquainted with US-made artillery systems, drones and radars.</p>
<p>The Hill report pointed out that the latest numbers revealed by US defense officials indicate a major increase compared to just &ldquo;<em>about a dozen such troops</em>&rdquo; in early April.</p>
<p>Over 220 Ukrainian troops have now been trained in the use of US-manufactured artillery, including the 155-mm M777 Howitzer &ndash; 90 of which Washington has pledged to provide to Kiev, the outlet said.</p>
<p>Twenty more Ukrainian service members on Sunday completed their training program on the state-of-the-art Phoenix Ghost loitering munition.</p>
<p>A senior US defense official cited by The Hill reportedly said on Monday that another fifty-plus Ukrainian troops were going to embark on a training course later this week.</p>

<p>US Army Brigadier General Joseph E. Hilbert, the head of the 7th Army Training Command in Europe, told journalists on Tuesday that the US instructors were &ldquo;<em>running them through a streamlined course here on the new equipment that they&rsquo;ll be receiving.</em>&rdquo; He noted that the &ldquo;<em>goal in all of this is to get them back as soon as possible, so that then they can train others within their army on the equipment.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilbert also confirmed that since 2015 the US has trained as many as 23,000 Ukrainian service members inside the country &ndash; a program which has so far cost $126 million. American instructors continued to provide training to Ukrainian troops in the country up until early this year, when the threat of a Russian invasion forced the Pentagon to withdraw its personnel from Ukraine.</p>
<p>On top of that, Ukrainian forces have participated in over a dozen large military exercises alongside American troops over the past seven years, the US general revealed.</p>
<p>Since the start of Russia&rsquo;s offensive against Ukraine on February 24, Washington has had to relocate the training program outside of Ukraine to Germany and some other locations, which US defense officials have refused to disclose.</p>
<p>General Hilbert characterized the Ukrainian soldiers receiving training as &ldquo;<em>absolutely motivated, incredibly professional.</em>&rdquo; He added that the troops showed a clear understanding of how to operate the US-supplied weapons systems &ldquo;<em>as effectively as they can on their own and in accordance with their own tactics and their own doctrine.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US general acknowledged that a language barrier posed a challenge at times, especially when US instructors had to describe some technical pieces of weapons and equipment. The training course is also constantly being adapted to the current developments on the ground in Ukraine, &ldquo;<em>incorporating the lessons observed and the lessons that we learned in a part of training that we do,</em>&rdquo; Hilbert said.</p>
<p>Since the military conflict between Kiev and Moscow broke out more than two months ago, the US has ramped up its weapons deliveries to Ukraine dramatically.</p>

<p>In late April, US President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass his $33-billion Ukraine aid package, which would see some $20 billion going toward providing Kiev with military support.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the US House of Representatives backed a bill reviving the famous &ldquo;<em>Lend-Lease Act,</em>&rdquo; which was previously used to help the allies during WWII. The legislation makes it easier for the US to export military equipment to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moscow, for its part, has repeatedly condemned NATO arms supplies to Kiev, insisting that they only serve to hamper the prospect for peace. The Kremlin also made it clear that any military equipment deliveries would be considered a legitimate military target for Russian forces once they crossed into Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>First Asian state admitted to the military bloc's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>South Korea has become the first Asian member state of NATO&rsquo;s Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE), the country&rsquo;s Yonhap news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a statement cited by the media outlet, Seoul&rsquo;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it plans to &ldquo;<em>strengthen our cyber response capabilities to a world-class level by increasing the number of our staff sent to the center and expanding the scope of joint training.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s accession to the CCDCOE has brought the number of members to 32, with 27 being NATO states, referred to as sponsoring nations. Korea and the other four members from outside the US-led&nbsp;bloc are contributing participants.</p>
<p>According to the NIS, it applied to join the CCDCOE back in 2019, and has participated in the center&rsquo;s activities since then &ndash; including the Locked Shields cyber defense wargames&nbsp;&ndash; for two consecutive years since 2020.</p>

<p>Commenting on its admittance to the group, Seoul&rsquo;s intelligence agency noted that &ldquo;<em>cyber threats are causing great damage not only to individuals but also to separate nations and also transnationally,</em>&rdquo; which makes &ldquo;<em>close international cooperation</em>&rdquo; crucial.</p>
<p>Based in Estonia&rsquo;s capital, Tallinn, the CCDCOE was founded back in 2008 in response to a 2007 massive cyberattack on Estonia&rsquo;s state networks &ndash; something the country&rsquo;s authorities were quick to blame on Russia. Officials in Tallinn, however, later admitted that they had no conclusive evidence to implicate the Kremlin.</p>
<p>On its website, the CCDCOE says its mission is to &ldquo;<em>support our member nations and NATO with unique interdisciplinary expertise in the field of cyber defence research, training and exercises covering the focus areas of technology, strategy, operations and law.</em>&rdquo; The group is committed to &ldquo;<em>fostering cooperation of like-minded nations,</em>&rdquo; both &ldquo;<em>NATO Allies and partners beyond the Alliance.</em>&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The payment platform appears to have reversed course after slapping Consortium News with a ‘permanent’ ban</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>PayPal has released nearly $10,000 it seized from alternative media outlet Consortium News (CN), the site&rsquo;s editor-in-chief has said, allowing it to withdraw its funds after stating they could be held for up to six months without explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>CN editor Joe Lauria noted the reversal on Wednesday, <a href="https://archive.ph/8EBxD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a> that the US payments company had informed the site its funds were <em>&ldquo;eligible for withdrawal&rdquo;</em> the night prior, days after freezing its $9,348 balance over unspecified <em>&ldquo;risk exposure&rdquo;</em> associated with the account.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;CN immediately withdrew the funds,&rdquo;</em> Lauria said, adding that <em>&ldquo;PayPal gave no reasons for its reversal, as it had given no reasons for its initial action.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the outlet was previously told its account would be shut down permanently, the editor said that may no longer be the case, as PayPal is now <em>&ldquo;asking CN to take steps to restore it.&rdquo;</em> However, the platform <em>&ldquo;failed to specify what those steps are,&rdquo;</em> leaving it unclear how CN might revive its account.</p>

<p>Despite only receiving generic notices from PayPal about the ban and funding freeze, Lauria suggested CN&rsquo;s news coverage may have motivated the decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Given the political climate it is reasonable to conclude that PayPal was reacting to Consortium News&rsquo; coverage of the war in Ukraine, which is not in line with the dominant narrative that is being increasingly enforced,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;If true, PayPal was allegedly seeking to limit Consortium News&rsquo; free speech by depriving it of one of its main vehicles for funding.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The crackdown came at an especially inconvenient moment for the reader-supported site, which is currently holding its spring fund drive. It appears to have done little to deter its fundraising efforts, however, as Lauria said CN received a <em>&ldquo;flood of donations&rdquo;</em> in the 48-hour period following the ban.</p>
<p><strong></strong>PayPal has penalized a number of independent journalists and media organizations in recent weeks, among them former RT America correspondent Caleb Maupin and MintPress News&nbsp;employees&nbsp;Alan MacLeod and Mnar Adley, each of whom had their accounts frozen without notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>MintPress News&rsquo; funds were also seized by PayPal last week, but have since been <a href="https://twitter.com/MnarMuh/status/1521641940437159936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released to the outlet</a>. Its account remains frozen, however, and like CN, the site was told it can take <em>&ldquo;steps&rdquo;</em> to remove the ban, yet PayPal <a href="https://twitter.com/MnarMuh/status/1521642738743189505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provided no further instructions</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Consortium News was founded in 1995 by the late journalist Robert Parry, whose investigative reporting at the Associated Press and Newsweek helped to expose the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s. A recipient of several national journalism awards, Parry edited CN until his death in 2018.</p>

                            <p><strong>The tech magnate was invited to tell British MPs about his plans for Twitter</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>British lawmakers have called on billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to give testimony about his planned&nbsp;$44 billion purchase of Twitter, asking him to detail his vision for the social media giant.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The request was made public early on Wednesday morning by MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Writing in a letter dated April 29, Knight said the appearance would give Musk a chance to discuss his plans for the platform&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;in more depth.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My committee has noted your proposed acquisition of Twitter and we are interested in the developments you propose,&rdquo;</em> the letter said, adding:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I know you have expressed your wish that critics remain on Twitter and this may present an opportunity to address any critiques in public.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve invited <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ElonMusk</a> to discuss the future of <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a> in Parliament.<br><br>Chair <a href="https://twitter.com/julianknight15?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JulianKnight15</a>: &quot;Appearing before the Committee will give Mr Musk an ideal opportunity to set out his proposals in more depth and we would look forward to welcoming him.”<br><br>🔎: <a href="https://t.co/HpYduMAcZY">https://t.co/HpYduMAcZY</a> <a href="https://t.co/UTU2wu1jnV">pic.twitter.com/UTU2wu1jnV</a></p>&mdash; Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsDCMS) <a href="https://twitter.com/CommonsDCMS/status/1521798004495237120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>In a separate <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/378/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/166198/elon-musk-invited-to-give-evidence-to-dcms-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, Knight went on to say that lawmakers are <em>&ldquo;keen to learn more about how Mr. Musk will balance his clear commitment to free speech with new obligations to protect Twitter&rsquo;s users from online harms.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Musk told the Associated Press that while he is <em>&ldquo;honored&rdquo;</em> by the invitation, <em>&ldquo;it would be premature at this time to accept&rdquo;</em> given that Twitter&rsquo;s shareholders have not yet voted to approve the multi-billion-dollar deal.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Knight&rsquo;s letter comes as British MPs review <em>&ldquo;online safety&rdquo;</em> legislation that would give regulators sweeping powers to clamp down on social media and other internet platforms. The bill contains a measure that would force larger sites to allow users to verify their identities and provide them the choice of avoiding interactions with unverified accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Musk has previously stated that he would like Twitter to <em>&ldquo;authenticate all humans,&rdquo;</em> though he did not elaborate on how that might be done.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In 2018, the same parliamentary committee issued a similar invite to then-Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (the company has since renamed itself Meta) to answer questions during a probe into &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; online, but the executive declined to show up.</p>

            <p>Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of killing George Floyd in an incident that triggered race riots across the US in 2020, has been spared the death penalty on federal civil-rights charges after a judge accepted his plea agreement.</p>
<p>US District Court Judge Paul Magnuson <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21866276-us-v-chauvin-order-accepting-plea-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved</a> Chauvin&rsquo;s December deal on Wednesday, confirming that the ex-officer will be sentenced to between 20 and 25 years in prison. Chauvin could have faced a life sentence or even the death penalty&nbsp;&ndash; though the latter was considered unlikely &ndash;&nbsp;if he had been convicted at trial.</p>
<p>Magnuson hasn&rsquo;t set a sentencing date for Chauvin, who infamously kneeled on the back of Floyd&rsquo;s neck for more than eight minutes. The 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department was convicted on murder and manslaughter charges last year in state court and was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.</p>

<p>In the federal case against him, Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to deprivation of civil rights under color of law. He reportedly entered his plea, foregoing a trial, on the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/derek-chauvin-federal-prison-means-hell-time/story?id=81845835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">condition</a> that he would serve his time in federal prison, rather than a state penitentiary, even though that will likely mean a longer time behind bars. Federal prisons tend to be less crowded and safer than state prisons in the US.</p>
<p>Chauvin will serve his state and federal sentences concurrently, meaning he won&rsquo;t have to start over on one after finishing the other. The 46-year-old could have been paroled in Minnesota after less than 15 years, assuming maximum credits for good behavior, while his federal plea deal reportedly dictates that he will be <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/george-floyd-death/judge-accepts-rare-negotiated-sentence-for-derek-chauvin-on-federal-civil-rights-case-connected-to-george-floyds-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incarcerated</a> for at least 17 years.</p>
<p>Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Floyd&rsquo;s family, had called for Chauvin to get the maximum sentence in his federal civil-rights case.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Western leaders should have negotiated with Russia, former Brazilian president says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Brazilian presidential frontrunner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told Time magazine on Wednesday that he believes the Western narrative on the Ukraine crisis&nbsp;is simplistic and fails to reflect the reality behind the situation.&nbsp;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is &ldquo;<em>as responsible as [Russian President Vladimir] Putin for the war</em>,&rdquo; he outlined, insisting that there is never just one guilty party in a conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zelensky &ldquo;<em>could have said: &lsquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s stop talking about this NATO business, about joining the EU for a while. Let&rsquo;s discuss a bit more first,&rsquo;</em>&rdquo; Lula said, while arguing that US President Joe Biden, too, could have averted the crisis. &ldquo;<em>The United States has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided [the conflict], not incited it.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lula believes the privileged position handed Zelensky by all western politicians is unjustifiable, noting that while he sees &ldquo;<em>the president of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians</em>,&rdquo; Zelensky is &ldquo;<em>as responsible as Putin for the war</em>,&rdquo; and it is irresponsible for the West to embrace him without qualification.<br /><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You are encouraging this guy, and then he thinks he is the cherry on your cake. We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of implicitly promising the Ukrainian leader his heart&rsquo;s desires, the US and EU should have reassured Russia that Ukraine would not join NATO, Lula argued, drawing parallels with the compromises made during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, in which both the US and USSR agreed to deescalate by removing missiles from each other&rsquo;s effective backyards. Such security guarantees have repeatedly cropped up during negotiations between Russia and NATO, only to be repeatedly scrapped by the West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>War is no solution</em>,&rdquo; Lula repeated. &ldquo;<em>And now we are going to have to foot the bill because of the war on Ukraine. Argentina, Bolivia will also have to pay. You&rsquo;re not punishing Putin. You&rsquo;re punishing many different countries, you&rsquo;re punishing mankind</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conflict in Ukraine has pulled up the curtain on the abject failure of the UN as a global body, Lula suggested, claiming &ldquo;<em>today&rsquo;s United Nations doesn&rsquo;t represent anything anymore. Governments don&rsquo;t take the UN seriously today, because they make decisions without respecting it. We need to create a new global governance</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Brazil will again become a protagonist on the international stage and we will prove that it&rsquo;s possible to have a better world</em>,&rdquo; Lula told the US outlet.</p>
<p>One of the most popular Brazilian politicians ever, Lula was president from 2003 to 2010. He was released from prison just over a year ago, after the Brazilian Supreme Court annulled his 2018 conviction on corruption charges, finding a biased judge had compromised his right to a fair trial. A political showdown looms between him and current leader Jair Bolsonaro in October&rsquo;s election, with Lula currently polling ahead of his rival by 14 points.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday afternoon, the State Department announced. The top official&nbsp;is experiencing only mild symptoms and will work from home until he can return to his department, his spokesman added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;The Secretary is fully vaccinated and boosted against the virus and is experiencing only mild symptoms. He tested negative on Tuesday and again as recently as this morning,&rdquo;</em> State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinken-tests-positive-for-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Blinken <em>&ldquo;encourages all Americans who are eligible to get fully vaccinated and boosted in order to protect themselves and their loved ones from developing severe Covid-19 disease,&rdquo;</em> Price added.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The diplomat&rsquo;s most recent meeting was with Swedish Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-swedish-foreign-minister-ann-linde-before-their-meeting-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Linde</a>&nbsp;earlier on Wednesday in Washington, DC. On Tuesday, he met with his Mexican counterpart <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-meeting-with-mexican-foreign-secretary-ebrard-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcelo Ebrard</a>, gave the <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-keynote-remarks-at-the-52nd-annual-conference-on-the-americas-luncheon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keynote speech</a> at the Annual Conference on the Americas Luncheon, and <a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/world-press-freedom-day-2022-state-of-world-press-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke</a> about the World Press Freedom Day at the State Department briefing room.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Price also pointed out that Blinken <em>&ldquo;has not seen President [Joe] Biden in person for several days, and the President is not considered a close contact according to guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong></strong>Biden appeared on Wednesday afternoon alongside Vice President Kamala Harris at a reception for US Olympians outside the White House. Harris, who tested positive for the virus on April 26 and was only cleared to return to work on Tuesday, was wearing a face mask &ndash; as was her husband.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Several reporters who attended the White House Correspondents&rsquo; Dinner over the weekend have since tested positive for the virus, including ABC&rsquo;s Jonathan Karl, who shook hands with Biden at the event. The White House insisted that gathering 2,600 people inside the ballroom of the Washington Hilton hotel was fine, since proof of vaccination and a same-day negative test were required, boosters were strongly encouraged, and masking was optional.</p>
<p><strong></strong>One of Biden&rsquo;s first executive orders mandated masks on federal property and on all forms of transportation. It was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge last month. Several other judges have also struck down Biden&rsquo;s attempt to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Organizations funded by European governments and George Soros say Musk’s goal of free speech will “toxify” the internet</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A group of&nbsp;26 NGOs, including some&nbsp;funded by European governments and billionaire financier George Soros, have called on Twitter&rsquo;s top advertisers to boycott the platform if Elon Musk restores banned accounts and lifts its current restrictions on open&nbsp;expression. Musk&rsquo;s stated commitment to free speech, they argued, will lead to <em>&ldquo;disinformation, hate, and harassment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Elon Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter will further toxify our information ecosystem and be a direct threat to public safety, especially among those already most vulnerable and marginalized,&rdquo;</em> the groups wrote in a <a href="https://accountabletech.org/wp-content/uploads/Letter-to-Twitter-Advertisers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Praising Twitter&rsquo;s content moderation policies, which critics have described as censorship, the liberal organizations warned that <em>&ldquo;Musk intends to steamroll those safeguards and provide a megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation, hate, and harassment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Under the guise of &lsquo;free speech,&rsquo; his vision will silence and endanger marginalized&nbsp;</em><em>communities, and tear at the fraying fabric of democracy,&rdquo;</em> they continued.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Among the groups opposing Musk&rsquo;s vision are the Black Lives Matter Global Network, Media Matters for America, Women&rsquo;s March, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and Access Now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Powerful donors are behind these groups. Access Now, which says it fights against internet censorship but supports <em>&ldquo;content moderation,&rdquo;</em> has <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/financials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taken</a> more than a million dollars from Soros&rsquo;s Open Society Foundations since last March, as well as funding from the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Media Matters for America is funded by US Democratic Party megadonors and was founded by David Brock, a longtime Clinton family operative who has <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/person/david-brock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with Soros</a> to elect Democrats. Soros has also funded a number of other organizations that signed the letter.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) is a pro-censorship NGO based in the UK, whose work as of late has focused on lobbying governments and tech firms to restrict vaccine-skeptic content online. The White House has <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/529448-biden-psaki-misinformation-censorship/">leaned on</a> the CCDH&rsquo;s research to aid its crackdown on so-called <em>&ldquo;misinformation&rdquo;</em> about Covid-19.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Musk himself has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1521574041814978562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> on his Twitter followers to investigate these <em>&ldquo;organizations that want to control your access to information,&rdquo;</em> declaring <em>&ldquo;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>However, these are not the only powerful interests sounding the alarm over Musk&rsquo;s purchase of Twitter. Microsoft co-founder and vaccine evangelist Bill Gates called on Wednesday for Musk to continue the platform&rsquo;s moderation policies, specifically mentioning posts saying <em>&ldquo;vaccines kill people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Musk purchased Twitter last week for $44 billion. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO promised to rid the platform of spam and bot accounts, to make its algorithm public, and to promote free and open speech, which he has described as <em>&ldquo;the bedrock of a functioning democracy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Within days of Musk&rsquo;s purchase, the White House announced the creation of a &lsquo;Disinformation Governance Board,&rsquo; <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554834-mayorkas-dhs-disinformation-unit/">ridiculed</a> by conservatives and free speech advocates as an Orwellian <em>&ldquo;Ministry of Truth.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Vice responds to leaked SCOTUS Roe v. Wade ruling by promoting video on DIY termination pills</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Some US media outlets have gone beyond decrying a draft Supreme Court ruling that would strike down the constitutional protection of abortion rights. Vice News went so far as to promote a video explaining how to make do-it-yourself abortion pills with an active ingredient that is also used to treat ulcers in horses.</p>
<p>The drug, misoprostol, <em>&ldquo;is relatively easy to acquire from veterinary sources,&rdquo;</em> Vice&rsquo;s Motherboard account said on Tuesday in a Twitter post promoting the article. The story&nbsp;linked to a 17-minute instructional video produced by an <em>&ldquo;anarchist collective&rdquo;</em> and briefly explained the process for making the DIY pills.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that it couldn&rsquo;t speak to the safety of taking DIY abortion pills, Vice touted misoprostol&rsquo;s efficacy in terminating pregnancies and defended the idea of offering such instructions. <em>&ldquo;In a progressive and just world, abortions would be free and safely administered by medical professionals,&rdquo;</em> the article said. <em>&ldquo;But we have seen time and time again that attacks on abortion access lead to less safe abortion alternatives performed by a patient themselves or without medical supervision.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Misoprostol is relatively easy to acquire from veterinary sources, since in addition to medically inducing abortions, it&#39;s also used to treat ulcers in horses. <a href="https://t.co/nglKSGjXA0">https://t.co/nglKSGjXA0</a></p>&mdash; Motherboard (@motherboard) <a href="https://twitter.com/motherboard/status/1521511916912488448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The article was just one of the more extreme media responses to a draft Supreme Court ruling that was leaked on Monday night to another outlet, Politico. The ruling, which was confirmed as authentic by Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday, would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that found abortion to be a constitutional right. If the ruling is officially made this summer, as expected, it would leave abortion rights up to state governments to decide for their own jurisdictions.</p>

<p>MSNBC contributor Elie Mystal agreed with the court&rsquo;s finding that the framers of the US Constitution didn&rsquo;t guarantee abortion rights, saying, <em>&ldquo;The founding fathers didn&rsquo;t recognize abortion as a fundamental right because the founding fathers were racist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NAIVkGuh2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misogynist jerkfaces</a> who didn&rsquo;t believe that women had any rights at all.&rdquo;</em> NBC News posted an article on the health risks that women would face as a result of the ruling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vice lamented that instructions on DIY abortion pills would need to be offered, saying it <em>&ldquo;speaks to the horrifying nature of the world we&rsquo;re finding ourselves in and the potential lengths women might need to go to have an abortion in a world without the protections of Roe v. Wade.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that the pill&rsquo;s active ingredient is a horse medicine, inasmuch as Vice and other media outlets mocked podcast host Joe Rogan last year for saying he used ivermectin to recover from a Covid-19 infection. Vice accused Rogan of spreading <em>&ldquo;misinformation about the horse-deworming drug he took,&rdquo;</em> noting that it wasn<em>&rsquo;</em>t an approved treatment for the virus.</p>

<p>While studies show misoprostol is generally considered safe and effective, it can cause uterine rupture and other serious side effects in rare cases. Those risks are greater when the drug is taken in incorrect doses, as evidenced by a 2016 study in Madagascar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782417305310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study&rsquo;s authors</a>, including Dolores Pourette of the Institute of Research for Development (IRD), <em>&ldquo;Use of misoprostol without information on correct use may not be as unsafe as traditional and invasive methods of abortion, but the women we interviewed were still experiencing serious complications and required urgent treatment postabortion.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Computer repairman sues CNN, congressman, others for falsely claiming data trove that he exposed was ‘Russian disinformation’</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Delaware computer technician who exposed data from a laptop left at his shop by President Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, Hunter Biden, has sued US Representative Adam Schiff (D-California) and three media outlets for defaming him by suggesting that he was an agent of a Russian disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>John Paul Mac Isaac&rsquo;s <a href="https://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/inquiryDetail.jis?caseId=C15CV22001781&amp;loc=68&amp;detailLoc=ODYCIVIL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> against Schiff, CNN, Politico, and the Daily Beast was filed on Tuesday at Montgomery County Circuit Court in Rockville, Maryland, seeking at least $1 million in actual damages and far more in punitive damages. Mac Isaac claimed that his business and reputation were destroyed because he was smeared as a treasonous criminal who worked with the Russians to influence the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>The filing was first reported by the New York Post, which also broke the story on alleged influence-peddling by the Biden family in October 2020 &ndash; just three weeks before the election &ndash; based on emails from Hunter Biden&rsquo;s abandoned laptop. <em>&ldquo;After fighting to reveal the truth, all I want now is for the rest of the country to know that there was a collective and orchestrated effort by social and mainstream media to block a real story with real consequences for the nation,&rdquo;</em> Mac Isaac <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/03/repairman-who-revealed-hunter-biden-laptop-sues-schiff-cnn-politico-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Post</a> on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The infamous laptop became Mac Isaac&rsquo;s property after Hunter Biden dropped it off at his shop for repairs in April 2019 and never came back. The repairman reportedly gave a copy of the hard drive to the FBI in December 2019 and later shared the data with Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for then-President Donald Trump, who provided a copy to the Post.</p>
<p>The scoop was censored on social media and ignored or discredited by major media outlets. More than 50 former US intelligence officials suggested that the data trove was Russian disinformation, a false claim that Joe Biden echoed while campaigning for president.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was collusion led by 51 former pillars in the intelligence community and backed by words and actions of a politically motivated DOJ and FBI,&rdquo;</em> Mac Isaac said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I want this lawsuit to reveal that collusion and more importantly, who gave the marching orders.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mac Isaac alleged that Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, defamed him by saying in a CNN interview that <em>&ldquo;the whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.&rdquo;</em> He claimed CNN knowingly broadcast a defamatory story falsely linking the laptop to Russia. He made similar allegations about reports by Politico and the Daily Beast.</p>

<p>Months after Biden took office, legacy media outlets began to corroborate the laptop scandal. Ironically, a Politico reporter last September reported that he had independently confirmed the authenticity of key emails from the laptop, contradicting earlier claims by his own publication. Earlier this year, the New York Times and the Washington Post confirmed the Hunter Biden emails&rsquo; authenticity.</p>
<p>Mac Isaac said he faced false accusations of being a Russian spy, and he was forced to close his repair shop and go into hiding in Colorado after people threw vegetables, eggs, and dog excrement at his business. He was also inundated with death threats and hate mail.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Mac Isaac sued Twitter last year for allegedly defaming him as a criminal hacker by censoring the Post&rsquo;s laptop scoop on the false claim that it was based on hacked materials. A judge dismissed that suit last September because Twitter never identified Mac Isaac, and the technician was ordered to pay the social media platform&rsquo;s legal fees, amounting to about $175,000.</p>
<p>Mac Isaac&rsquo;s latest legal action is being funded by the America Project, a group led by businessman Patrick Byrne, retired Army General Michael Flynn, and Flynn&rsquo;s brother, Joseph Flynn. <em>&ldquo;My team is happy to provide the financial resources to allow John Paul Mac Isaac to seek true justice,&rdquo;</em> Joseph Flynn said.</p>

<p>The plaintiff said he hopes to expose where efforts to attack the laptop story originated. <em>&ldquo;The fight to get to the bottom of who told everyone this was Russian disinformation is far more important for the nation than me clearing my name,&rdquo;</em> Mac Isaac said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>In 2001, the US was expelled from the UN Human Rights Commission</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>May 4, 2001 marks the day when the US was voted off the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The decision should have provided the superpower with a much-needed wakeup call. Instead, it just became more reckless on the global stage.</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, there was no loss of irony about Washington <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/04/world/for-first-time-us-is-excluded-from-un-human-rights-panel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losing its seat</a>&nbsp;on the body for the first time since the panel&rsquo;s founding in 1947. That&rsquo;s because, as far as America&rsquo;s track record on human rights was concerned, the &lsquo;best&rsquo; was yet to come. In a few short years, the United States would rewrite the book for inhumane behavior in its decades-long War on Terror. And while that is something nobody could have predicted in May 2001, perhaps the feeling that America had lost its moral compass was already in the air.</p>
<p>One of the stated reasons for the Geneva-based organization voting out the global power was its increasing frustration with Washington balking on its commitment to international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In direct opposition to the opinions of its European allies, George W. Bush withdrew Washington's tentative support for the measure, <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arguing</a> it would cause <em>&ldquo;serious harm to the US economy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Another cited reason for the Americans being&nbsp;ousted from their chair was due to the relentless support of Israel over the latter&rsquo;s perennial conflict with the Palestinians. In March 2001, following non-stop episodes of violence and killing, with the Palestinian side suffering the brunt of the casualties, the UN Security Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080316104751/http:/www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/s01270.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted</a> to pass a resolution that would have created<em> &ldquo;an appropriate mechanism to protect Palestinian civilians, including through the establishment of a United Nations observer force.&rdquo;</em> Predictably, the United States was the only member to deliver a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080317010910/http:/www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thumbs down</a> on the motion, with four abstaining. In fact, nearly all US vetoes cast since 1988 blocked resolutions aimed at Israel, because, as the US claims, Palestinian terrorist groups were not adequately condemned.</p>

<p>Not everyone, of course, agreed with the decision to drop the US from its membership of the human rights club. Amnesty International, for example, jumped to America&rsquo;s defense, calling its removal <em>&ldquo;part of an effort by nations that routinely violate human rights to escape scrutiny.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, this brings us to the real irony of America being stripped of its seat in the first place. As stated earlier, not only did the Washington fail to heed the warning over its increasingly arrogant actions, its behavior actually worsened over time.</p>
<p>In his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, George W. Bush branded three countries &mdash; North Korea, Iran and Iraq &mdash; as an <em>&ldquo;axis of evil.&rdquo;</em> Just prior to the US leader casting judgment on those nations, Washington opened the doors to the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (Gitmo), or, as Amnesty International famously dubbed it, <em>&ldquo;the Gulag of our time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Situated on the southernmost tip of Cuba at the Guantanamo Naval Base, Gitmo has become synonymous with the very things that the UN Human Rights Commission fought to prevent, namely brutality, torture, and the perversion of justice.</p>
<p>Moazzam Begg, a prisoner-turned-activist who spent three years at Gitmo, described the horrors he witnessed. <em>&ldquo;I saw two people beaten to death,&rdquo;</em> Begg told RT. <em>&ldquo;I saw one prisoner with his hands tied above his head to the top of the cage being repeatedly punched and kicked until he was killed. The Americans have accepted that this was a homicide.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today marks the 20th anniversary of the first prisoner&#39;s arrival at Guantánamo Bay. Nearly two decades after the start of the U.S. so-called war on terror, 39 people are still detained at the detention camp where prisoners have detailed torture and other horrific conditions. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OTD</a> <a href="https://t.co/ajHlKczLiE">pic.twitter.com/ajHlKczLiE</a></p>&mdash; Democracy Now!

<p>In April 2004, it was also discovered that the United States was responsible for severe human rights violations at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Euphemistically described as &lsquo;enhanced interrogation techniques,&rsquo; prisoners were systematically tortured, raped and sodomized. The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,1211872,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> some of the shocking images, and viewer discretion is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, America&rsquo;s human rights record did not get better with the arrival of Barack Obama, America&rsquo;s first black president who rose to power on the promise of <em>&ldquo;hope and change.&rdquo;</em> In 2016 alone, on Obama&rsquo;s watch, US forces <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped</a> some 26,171 bombs on foreign countries. Syria and Iraq were both targeted some 12,000 times each, while Afghanistan (1,337), Libya (496), Yemen (35), Somalia (14), and Pakistan (three) also experienced attacks on their territory. In his last year in office, Barack Obama had the ignoble distinction of being at war longer than any other president in US history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the United States learned anything over the past several decades since being voted off the UN commission? Judging by the fate of some of its biggest detractors, it would appear not. In 2010, the Australian activist Julian Assange published a series of leaked documents &ndash; with Hollywood-sounding names like &lsquo;Collateral Murder&rsquo; and &lsquo;Iraq War Logs&rsquo; detailing possible war crimes by the US military &ndash; provided by Army analyst Chelsea Manning.</p>

<p>After being granted asylum for seven years at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the grounds of political persecution (Assange was also wanted in Sweden on sex assault allegations, but feared that if he were there he would be delivered into the hands of American prosecutors), he was arrested by the UK police. In May 2019, President Donald Trump's government charged him with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. The move was harshly condemned by media outlets as an infringement on the First Amendment. Since April 2019, Assange has been incarcerated at the Belmarsh maximum-security prison in London as his health reportedly deteriorates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Edward Snowden, the former CIA analyst turned whistleblower, has also paid a hefty price for shining a light on some of the US government&rsquo;s less admirable activities, like spying on citizens both at home and abroad. Now living in Russia, Snowden reportedly awaits the day when he will be allowed to return to his homeland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those believing inhumane treatment was reserved for <em>&ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;traitors,&rdquo;</em> just this week, Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko returned home after enduring more than a decade in a US prison over his alleged involvement in a drug-smuggling scheme. Yaroshenko revealed the horrors he was exposed to during that time.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There was a torture room where I was tortured for two-and-a-half days. It was inhuman torture, physical and psychological, with enormous pressure. At some point, I didn&rsquo;t even want to live&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to return back into this world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Clearly, this is not the sort of behavior one would expect from a country that regularly passes judgment on other governments. The saying about &lsquo;people who live in glass houses&rsquo; comes to mind. Unsolicited sermons on human rights make more sense coming from those who practice what they preach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>27% said they will “definitely not” vaccinate their children</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Around 18% of US parents with children under five years old intend to have them vaccinated<em> &ldquo;right away&rdquo;</em> once regulators authorize the use of Covid-19 shots for the age group, a new survey released on Wednesday shows. Children under five remain the only age group still not eligible for vaccination in the US.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a San Francisco-headquartered non-profit, in April.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 27% said they would <em>&ldquo;definitely not&rdquo;</em> have their child vaccinated, while another 11% said they would do so only if legally required. Around 38% said they plan to wait and see how the vaccines actually work on children under five before making a decision. More than half of parents said they still do not have enough information on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines for the age group.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Lack of available information may be a factor in parents&rsquo; reluctance to get their youngest children vaccinated right away. A majority of parents of children under five say they don&rsquo;t have enough information about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children in this age group,&rdquo;</em> KFF noted, adding that <em>&ldquo;most parents of older children feel better informed, with three-quarters of parents of teens and two-thirds of parents of kids ages 5-11 saying they have enough information.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The survey comes as the leading US vaccine makers are getting closer to having their shots approved for pediatric use. In late April, Moderna said it had asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to authorize its coronavirus vaccine for children under six, becoming the first manufacturer to do so. The company is expected to finish submitting its data to the regulator by May 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think for these little children, they really represent an unmet medical need,&rdquo;</em> the chief medical officer for Moderna, Paul Burton, told ABC News last week. <em>&ldquo;I would be hopeful that the review will go on quickly and rigorously &ndash; but if it&rsquo;s approvable, this will be made available to these little children as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Pfizer said on Tuesday it plans to submit data on its three-dose pediatric vaccine to the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by late May or early June. The company said it expects the regulators to consider the shot&rsquo;s approval shortly afterwards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Microsoft founder says Tesla chief could fail to censor “misinformation” on Twitter after takeover</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is bracing for potential trouble when fellow billionaire Elon Musk completes his acquisition of Twitter, saying the free-speech advocate could make misinformation more prevalent by failing to properly police comment on the social media platform.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;He actually could make it worse,&rdquo;</em> Gates said of Musk on Wednesday in a Wall Street Journal interview. He added that the South African&nbsp;has a <em>&ldquo;mind-blowing&rdquo;</em> track record of building successful businesses at Tesla and SpaceX by being bolder than competitors and <em>&ldquo;really showing them up.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I kind of doubt that will happen this time, but we should have an open mind and never underestimate Elon,&rdquo;</em> Gates said. <em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his goal? Where he talks about the openness, how does he feel about something that says vaccines kill people or that Bill Gates is tracking people? Is that one of the things he thinks should be spread? So it&rsquo;s still&hellip; It&rsquo;s not totally clear what he&rsquo;s going to do.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bill Gates commented on Elon Musk&#39;s plan to purchase Twitter and how he could make misinformation online worse. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WSJCEOCouncil?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WSJCEOCouncil</a> <a href="https://t.co/0E4mtWvjQI">https://t.co/0E4mtWvjQI</a> <a href="https://t.co/xkQMpurrcO">pic.twitter.com/xkQMpurrcO</a></p>&mdash; The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1521844594538950656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Gates argued that governments and social media companies failed to fully squash false commentary related to the Covid-19 pandemic. <em>&ldquo;When you don&rsquo;t have the trusted leaders speaking out about vaccines, it&rsquo;s pretty hard for the platforms to work against that,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;So I think we have a leadership problem, and we have a platform problem.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em></em>Musk reached a deal with Twitter last week to buy the company for $44 billion. He has vowed to restore freedom of speech to the platform, setting off fears from the White House to Silicon Valley that Twitter will no longer censor commentary that establishment voices brand as <em>&ldquo;misinformation.&rdquo;</em> President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration announced plans to create a Disinformation Governance Board just two days after Twitter&rsquo;s directors agreed to accept Musk&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<p>However, determining whether speech is false often is in the eye of the beholder. For instance, some commentary that was censored early in the pandemic &ndash; such as a theory that the virus originated in a Chinese lab &ndash; became mainstream in later months. The woman chosen to head up the Disinformation Governance Board, Nina Jankowicz, has herself been a spreader of false conspiracy theories, such as dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop scandal as a <em>&ldquo;Russian influence op.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Musk has claimed that <em>&ldquo;free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy.&rdquo;</em> He mocked those who criticized his Twitter deal, saying, <em>&ldquo;The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal interview came one day after Gates told NBC News that perhaps there should be laws <em>&ldquo;that strike a better balance of free speech versus conspiracy theories confusing people.&rdquo;</em> On Wednesday, he said he previously thought <em>&ldquo;human judgment&rdquo;</em> would be strong enough to contain the spread of absurdly false speech.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So far, at least under the stress of the pandemic, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped the crazy stuff from getting out and kind of resonating with people,&rdquo;</em> Gates said.</p>
<p>The vaccine and climate-change activist claimed that he&rsquo;s&nbsp;reserving judgment on&nbsp;whether Musk will make Twitter better or worse. <em>&ldquo;The fact that he didn&rsquo;t buy Twitter to make money means that if there&rsquo;s something great that can be done, if all you need is money and hiring great engineers, he&rsquo;s probably as good a person as any.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Are his goals for what it ends up being, does it match this idea of less extreme falsehoods spreading so quickly -- weird conspiracy theories? Does he share that goal or not?</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Days before reaching his deal with Twitter, Musk accused Gates of short-selling Tesla stock &ndash; essentially betting on shares of the electric vehicle maker to fall. He rejected a meeting to discuss climate-change philanthropy with Gates after hearing that the software magnate was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/23/elon-musk-tweets-that-he-confronted-bill-gates-about-shorting-tesla.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shorting the stock</a>, reportedly saying, <em>&ldquo;Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Asked on Wednesday whether he shorted Tesla shares, Gates said, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that the stock went down and whoever shorted the stock made money, I don&rsquo;t know.

                            <p><strong>After an estimated half a million cases of adverse effects, Professor Harald Matthes called on doctors to “take action”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Professor Harald Matthes of Berlin&rsquo;s Charite University Hospital said on Tuesday that he has recorded 40 times more<em> &ldquo;serious side effects&rdquo;</em> from Covid-19 vaccinations than official German sources have acknowledged. As Matthes called on doctors to speak up for those allegedly injured, US pharma giant Pfizer released a tranche of data apparently showing its jab was far less effective than claimed.</p>
<p>Matthes has been conducting a study entitled &lsquo;Safety Profile of Covid-19 Vaccines&rsquo; for a year, and after surveying 40,000 vaccinated people, he has noticed that one in every 125 have struggled with <em>&ldquo;serious side effects,&rdquo;</em> Germany&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/panorama/corona-impfung-nebenwirkungen-impfschaeden-100.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDR</a> television network reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>"The number is not surprising,"</em> Matthes explained. <em>"It corresponds to what is known from other countries such as Sweden, Israel or Canada. Incidentally, even the manufacturers of the vaccines have already determined similar values ​​in their studies."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>However, Matthes claimed that this risk profile is 40 times higher than that noted by the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), the health ministry agency in charge of the country's vaccine rollout. The PEI currently <a href="https://www.pei.de/EN/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/medicine-safety.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">states</a> that serious reactions occur in just 0.2 out of every 1,000 vaccine doses administered.</p>

<p>Some of the effects Matthes&rsquo; team have recorded include muscle and joint pain, heart inflammation, dysfunction of the immune system and neurological disorders. With 179 million vaccine doses administered in Germany thus far, Matthes claimed that there could be as many as <em>&ldquo;half a million cases with serious side effects.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The researcher, whose hospital is regarded as the <a href="https://www.charite.de/service/pressemitteilung/artikel/detail/charite_erneut_als_deutschlands_beste_klinik_ausgezeichnet-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best</a> in Germany and has treated former Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that doctors need to take action and discuss the prevalence of such side effects <em>&ldquo;openly at congresses and in public without being considered anti-vaccination."</em></p>
<p>In the US on Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released <a href="https://phmpt.org/pfizers-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90,000</a> pages of documents from vaccine manufacturer Pfizer relating to the safety and efficacy of its Covid-19 shot. Preliminary analysis of the document dump suggests that during the pharma giant&rsquo;s own studies, 1,223 people out of 29,914 suffering adverse events <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1521585591707648001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died</a> following vaccination, and that the jab reduced the absolute risk of dying from Covid-19 by less than one percent, a point that has already been highlighted by research published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lancet</a> medical journal.</p>

                            <p><strong>The European Union has proposed a six-month phase-out of Russian crude imports</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The European Union has so far not presented Hungary with firm guarantees of its energy security amid an effort to phase out Russian oil imports, the Hungarian government said on Wednesday. The comment came ahead of a meeting of EU envoys on the decision.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government&rsquo;s press office told the news outlet AFP that it did not &ldquo;<em>see any plan or guarantee on how even a transition could be managed on the basis of the current proposals, and what would guarantee Hungary&rsquo;s energy security.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to AFP, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested that Hungary and Slovakia, two nations heavily dependent on Russian oil, be given an additional transition period to ensure a less painful implementation of the ban.</p>
<p>The phase-out of Russian oil had been touted as one of the components of the EU&rsquo;s sixth round of sanctions against Moscow, which representatives of all 27 EU member states discussed on Wednesday. For the new sanctions to come into effect, the package has to be backed unanimously.</p>

<p>Hungary has previously spoken against the proposed ban on Russian oil imports, with the country&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto emphasizing on Tuesday that &ldquo;<em>currently it is physically impossible to operate Hungary or the Hungarian economy without Russian oil.</em>&rdquo; According to Budapest, it receives as much as 65% of its oil from Russia.</p>
<p>Slovakia, while actively supporting Ukraine, including with weapons deliveries, has also opposed Brussels&rsquo; plan. The country&rsquo;s Economy Minister Richard Sulik told journalists on Tuesday that Slovakia&rsquo;s sole refiner, Slovnaft, could not replace Russian oil with an alternative overnight, adding that the switch in technology would take up to several years. The official confirmed that Bratislava would &ldquo;<em>insist on the exemption.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both countries receive Russian oil via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline.</p>
<p>On Monday, Reuters, citing unnamed EU officials, reported that the European Commission was intent on putting the ban in place by the start of next year one way or another. Russia exports nearly half of its crude oil and petroleum products to Europe, which represents a considerable source of its revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Over 200 personnel have been re-housed from the USS George Washington aircraft carrier</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Navy has decided to allow sailors living on the USS George Washington to move to alternative accommodation after a string of suicides onboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The vessel has been dry-docked in Virginia since 2017 and is undergoing an extensive overhaul and refueling process.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The move plan will continue until all Sailors who wish to move off-ship have done so,&rdquo;</em> Naval Air Force Atlantic said in a statement.</p>
<p>While the vessel is not fully crewed during the overhaul process, roughly half of its full 5,000-strong compartment continues to work there. Some 420 sailors live at the dry-docked vessel. The move began on Monday, with more than 200 sailors already leaving the carrier and moving ashore to a nearby Navy facility.</p>
<p>The decision to allow sailors not to live aboard the vessel undergoing repairs comes after a string of deaths at the aircraft carrier. Over the past 12 month, seven crew members of the USS George Washington have died, including at least four by suicide. Three deaths came within less than a week in April, apparently triggering the relocation process.</p>

<p>Speaking during a media roundtable on Tuesday, Admiral John Meier, the commander of US Naval Air Force Atlantic, admitted the decision to deploy sailors to a vessel still undergoing repairs might have been premature.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If I knew then what I know today, I think we would have clearly delayed crew move aboard,&rdquo;</em> the commander said.</p>
<p>According to media reports, sailors have repeatedly complained about the conditions on board the vessel, describing heavy construction sounds, ventilation and hot-water outages, the long commute to and from the vessel, among other grievances. Meier himself admitted that he was aware that some crewmembers spent more than three hours a day just commuting to the carrier.</p>
<p>The Navy has launched two separate probes to investigate whether the string of deaths is linked and to establish whether the spike in suicides is related to the living and working conditions or to the <em>&ldquo;command climate&rdquo;</em> onboard the vessel.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve assigned an investigating officer to look into that and to really to look into the proximate cause. Was there an immediate trigger? Was there a linkage between those events? I expect that to report out this week, and I won't presuppose the outcome of that report,&rdquo;</em> Meier said, adding that it was up to his superiors whether or not the report will be made public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The possible repeal of Roe v. Wade has laid bare the hypocrisy of the Dems’ pro-choice rhetoric</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A draft opinion by US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on the controversial issue of abortion was recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473?_amp=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked by Politico</a>, and later confirmed as authentic by the Court. This has predictably ignited a fierce debate around abortion, e.g., whether or not women should have the right to terminate a pregnancy and, if so, what limits should be imposed on that right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the draft opinion, representing the majority of the Court, America&rsquo;s supreme judicial body has thoroughly repudiated the 1973 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roe v. Wade</a> and another decision in 1992, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>. As Alito wrote, the Court believes that<em> &ldquo;Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,&rdquo;</em> he says in the document, titled <em>&ldquo;Opinion of the Court.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives.&rdquo;</em> Translation: Abortion will become a state&rsquo;s rights issue, thus effectively outlawing its practice in a majority of states &ndash; even to the point of it being a criminal offense to either administer or receive an abortion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that this is a gross violation of human rights and an attack on civil liberties. I believe that a woman has the right to control her own reproduction and her body, and I believe, for example, forcing underage girls to carry rape babies to term is deeply immoral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also think repealing Roe and Casey is particularly egregious for a country that has a relatively high maternity mortality rate and also has no paid maternity leave and no universal or subsidized child care, on top of other important issues. The United States of America does everything it can to make motherhood a burden on the working class &ndash; and we have to be real about the fact that since abortion is accessible in virtually every other country on the planet, it means the wealthy will be able to have them still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, examining this opinion closely reveals that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court wants to continue imposing its ideology by overruling more decisions. For example, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obergfell v. Hodges</a>, the case that led to gay marriage being legalized, or <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2002/02-102.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, the case that led to homosexuality being decriminalized, could be next on the chopping block based on Alito&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>
<p>What is the most cynical aspect of this whole situation, however, is how the Democratic Party is using it as a rallying cry &ndash;&nbsp;despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve fallen on their face continuously. The Democratic Party claims to be a champion of women&rsquo;s rights and always warns voters that Roe could be overturned if they don&rsquo;t vote Dem. But every time Democrats have had the ability to pass an abortion bill, they haven&rsquo;t done so. For me, this issue is just another example of how the Democratic Party is controlled opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in 2007, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/us/politics/15abortion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">candidate Barack Obama promised Planned Parenthood</a> that <em>&ldquo;the first thing I&rsquo;d do as president&rdquo;</em> would be to sign the Freedom of Choice Act. Even when holding a federal trifecta for 72 working days, President Barack Obama did not do that &ndash; and then said later that the bill is <em>&ldquo;not my highest legislative priority.&rdquo;</em> After four years in office, it never happened; abortion went from a day one priority to never.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democrats again effectively control the government, with the White House, a majority in the House and a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that legislation effectively needs a supermajority in the Senate thanks to the filibuster &ndash; but mechanisms, like a reconciliation, do exist that could see abortion snuck through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of actually taking action to codify abortion rights, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi along with James Clyburn were just in Texas <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgm7xb/rep-henry-cuellar-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaigning</a>&nbsp;for anti-choice Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar instead of his pro-choice opponent <a href="https://twitter.com/JCisnerosTX?s=20&amp;t=menz7RYZgyG21SxdFF8X9w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Cisneros</a>. Meanwhile, that same day her office was sending out fundraising emails talking about how important defending abortion rights are. Is there not a more perfect example of how hypocritical Democrats are on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With heated and extremely consequential mid-term elections coming up this November, Democrats are absolutely going to make the repudiation of abortion rights a key issue. They will craft their messaging to suggest that they are the party that will do anything to protect women and the other groups that could be thrown under the bus in the coming years. It&rsquo;s all bogus. Democrats will do nothing &ndash; just like their track record suggests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>President Klaus Iohannis told Romania’s parliament that he had invited the mechanized infantry force</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told his parliament on Tuesday that he has invited an American Stryker battalion to beef up Bucharest's security amid the conflict in Ukraine. Iohannis, a firm ally of Kiev, said the deployment demonstrated his country&rsquo;s commitment to the US-led NATO bloc.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The escalation of tensions and the massive consolidation of the Russian military presence in the vicinity of Ukraine and the Black Sea region are affecting international security and stability, and in particular European and regional security on the Black Sea,&rdquo;</em> he told lawmakers in a letter, according to the <a href="https://www.capital.ro/klaus-iohannis-a-informat-parlamentul-in-legatura-cu-prezenta-batalionului-stryker-al-sua-in-romania.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romanian media</a>.</p>
<p>The deployment of a US Stryker battalion would therefore <em>&ldquo;strengthen Romania&rsquo;s resilience,&rdquo;</em> he continued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Stryker battalion consists of a headquarters company and three companies of infantry and Stryker light armored vehicles. It is unclear whether this battalion is already on its way to Romania, but the deployment would come after the US sent a 1,000-troop Stryker squadron &ndash; a force slightly larger than a battalion &ndash; to Romania from Germany in early February.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;This significant contribution is an unequivocal demonstration of the solidarity of the United States, as Romania&rsquo;s ally and main strategic partner,&rdquo;</em> Iohannis&rsquo; letter continued. The Romanian leader also described the deployment as demonstrating his country&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;active and consistent positioning&rdquo;</em> within the NATO alliance.</p>
<p>Romania joined NATO in 2004, and has participated in the US-led military bloc&rsquo;s missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans. Bucharest has also taken a firmly pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia stance since 2014, when then-president Traian Basecu called on the alliance to arm the Ukrainian military, and has backed the accession of Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance.</p>
<p>Following the launch of Russia&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine in late February, Bucharest has sent fuel and ammunition to Kiev, and has lobbed accusations of war crimes at Russia, which Moscow denies.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>London accused RT of spreading “dangerous nonsense” amid Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The UK is forcing social media, internet service providers and app stores to block content from state-sponsored Russian media outlets &ndash; RT and Sputnik news agency. <em>&ldquo;For too long RT and Sputnik have churned out dangerous nonsense dressed up as serious news to justify Putin&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Tech and Digital Economy Minister Chris Philp said on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These outlets have already been booted off the airwaves in Britain and we&rsquo;ve barred anyone from doing business with them. Now we&rsquo;ve moved to pull the plug on their websites, social media accounts and apps to further stop the spread of their lies.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In March, Britain&rsquo;s media regulator, Ofcom, revoked RT&rsquo;s broadcasting license. The EU decided to ban RT from broadcasting the same month. RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina said at the time that Ofcom revoked the license for <em>&ldquo;purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine.&rdquo;</em> She said that the regulator <em>&ldquo;falsely judged RT to not be &lsquo;fit and proper&rsquo; and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has urged the EU to make key decisions by a qualified majority, rather than seeking unanimous consent of its member states.<br />Draghi said that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine, the EU must learn to work more robustly and effectively.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The geopolitical situation is undergoing rapid and profound change. We have to move, and move as quickly as possible,&rdquo;</em> Draghi told the European Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Building a common defense must be accompanied by a united foreign policy, and effective decision-making mechanisms.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We must move beyond the principle of unanimity, which gives rise to an intergovernmental approach based on mutual vetoes, and we must head towards qualified majority decision-making.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;A Europe able to make prompt decisions is more credible in the eyes of its citizens and in the eyes of the world,&rdquo;</em> Draghi said.</p>

<p>The PM urged to <em>&ldquo;streamline and optimize&rdquo;</em> military spending, and to process Ukraine&rsquo;s application to join the EU <em>&ldquo;as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We need pragmatic federalism, encompassing all areas affected by the ongoing transformations &ndash; from the economy to energy and security,&rdquo;</em> Draghi said.</p>
<p>The veto power allows the bloc&rsquo;s individual members to strike down decisions that affect the EU as a whole. Most recently, Hungary said that it would not back a ban on Russian oil and gas because its economy is heavily dependent on energy supplies from Moscow.</p>
<p>Last week, the European Parliament approved draft proposals for a comprehensive EU reform, stating that most issues that are now<em> &ldquo;decided by way of unanimity should be decided by way of a qualified majority.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been included on a list of sanctioned persons issued by Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. The measure comes in response to an <em>&ldquo;unprecedented anti-Russian campaign&rdquo;</em> led by Kishida&rsquo;s administration, the ministry points out.</p>
<p>Moscow has blacklisted 63 officials and public figures, with the country&rsquo;s foreign minister, minister of defense, finance and justice ministers among them. They all are banned from entering Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foreign ministry blames Tokyo for <em>&ldquo;unacceptable rhetoric towards the Russian Federation, including defamation and direct threats,&rdquo;</em> which are <em>&ldquo;repeated by public figures, experts and representatives of the Japanese media, and completely subjected to the Western bias&rdquo;</em> towards the country.</p>

            <p>North Korea launched a suspected ballistic missile from Sunan Airport in Pyongyang on Wednesday, South Korea and Japan have said.</p>
<p>The South&rsquo;s Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) said the missile traveled 470km (292 miles) towards the Sea of Japan. The launch is <em>&ldquo;a grave threat to the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the international community and clearly violates the UN Security Council resolutions,&rdquo;</em> according to the JCS.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our military is tracking and monitoring related movements to prepare against the possibility of an additional launch, and it is maintaining a full readiness posture,&rdquo;</em> the Korean military told reporters.</p>
<p>The JCS added that it is monitoring the situation for any additional launches that may occur. According to South Korean media, JCS Chairman General Won In-choul held a video conference about the alleged missile test with US Forces Korea (USFK) Commander General Paul LaCamera.</p>

<p>The Japanese Defense Ministry also said it detected the missile launch.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;North Korea&rsquo;s recent actions, including frequent missile launches, cannot be tolerated,&rdquo;</em> Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, commenting on the matter during a trip to Rome. He added that the tests pose a threat to the safety of the region.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has not confirmed the reports of what is allegedly the 14th such test since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un personally oversaw the firing of a<em> &ldquo;new-type tactical guided weapon.&rdquo;</em> At a military parade in late April, he vowed to accelerate development of nuclear weapons and use them if Pyongyang&rsquo;s &ldquo;fundamental interests&rdquo; are violated.</p>
<p>The latest suspected launch comes just a week before the inauguration of South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who is known for having a more hardline stance towards the North.</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, then-US President Donald Trump and Kim held face-to-face talks aimed at denuclearization, though the discussions eventually stalled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Americans&rsquo; visits to schools and places of worship were measured on a granular level, while another program focused on surveilling the effectiveness of policy interventions inside the Navajo nation and another concentrated on &ldquo;<em>exposure to certain building types, urban areas and violence</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the CDC&rsquo;s data was aggregated &ndash; apparently aimed at tracking larger trends among populations &ndash; studies have repeatedly shown that such supposedly anonymous information can be de-anonymized to the point of pinpointing individuals. Worse, the company the CDC used to obtain its data, SafeGraph, is backed by Peter Thiel, whose company Palantir was deeply involved in the UK&rsquo;s own ultra-intrusive Covid-19 tracking efforts.</p>

<p>Even Google &ndash; itself&nbsp;criticized for breaches while protecting users&rsquo; privacy &ndash; banned SafeGraph from its Play Store over unscrupulous sales practices last year.</p>
<p>While the CDC insisted SafeGraph&rsquo;s data was &ldquo;<em>critical for ongoing response efforts, such as hourly monitoring of activity in curfew zones or detailed counts of visits to participating pharmacies for vaccine monitoring</em>,&rdquo; cybersecurity researcher Zach Edwards told Motherboard the agency appeared to have &ldquo;<em>purposefully created an open-ended list of use cases, which included monitoring curfews, neighbor to neighbor visits, visits to churches, schools and pharmacies, and also a variety of analysis with this data specifically focused on &lsquo;violence.&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the data was obtained as &ldquo;<em>urgent</em>,&rdquo; such expediency supposedly justified by the pandemic, many of the uses it was meant for had little if anything to do with the outbreak. Cases like &ldquo;<em>research points of interest for physical activity and chronic disease prevention such as visits to parks, gyms, or weight management businesses</em>,&rdquo; for example, appeared totally unrelated to the virus, as did &ldquo;<em>exposure to place-based environmental exposures, like places with high air pollution and area-level incidence of pollution-related outcomes like asthma.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another vaguely ominous area of documentation focused on the use of &ldquo;<em>mobility data and services&hellip; to support non-Covid-19 programmatic areas and public health priorities... including but not limited to travel to parks and greenspaces, physical activity and mode of travel, and population migration before, during, and after natural disasters.</em>&rdquo; Such information would be used across the agency to &ldquo;<em>support numerous CDC priorities</em>.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he may charge certain users a fee for using Twitter. The billionaire struck a deal to purchase the social media platform last week.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,&rdquo;</em> Musk tweeted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He followed up with another tweet: <em>&ldquo;Ultimately, the downfall of the Freemasons was giving away their stone-cutting services for nothing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He added: <em>&ldquo;Some revenue is better than none!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment on the matter when contacted by Reuters.</p>

<p>The social media platform has always been free to use. However, Reuters reported last week that Musk told banks that agreed to help fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter that he would find ways to monetize tweets. Musk declined to comment on the matter at the time.</p>
<p>Musk, who is ranked by Forbes as the world&rsquo;s richest man, struck a deal with Twitter executives to buy the platform on April 25. The divisive news was met with both praise and fears, including among Twitter&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>Musk promised to uphold freedom of speech on Twitter while following the law. <em>&ldquo;By &lsquo;free speech&rsquo; I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,&rdquo;</em> he wrote last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Germany will support the admission of Finland and Sweden into the NATO military alliance, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, after the two Nordic states expressed interest in joining up despite decades of neutrality.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking to reporters on Tuesday following two days of closed-door meetings with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts in a town near Berlin, Scholz vowed to back both nations&rsquo; bid to join the Western military bloc should they submit membership applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For us it is clear: If these two countries decide they should join the NATO alliance then they can count on our support,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-sweden-germany-protection-nato-membership-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, adding,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Even in the period before such NATO membership is decided, they can always rely on Germany&rsquo;s support. As Europeans, we see ourselves obliged to do so anyway.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Scholz&rsquo;s comments follow reports that Helsinki could declare its intent to join NATO as early as next week, with President Sauli Niinisto purportedly set to announce the move on May 12. It remains unclear if Stockholm will follow suit, though the country&rsquo;s parliament recently said it would conduct a review of Swedish security policy before a decision is made.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>While earlier reports stated both countries would submit their applications at the same time, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto has said his country could ultimately go ahead without its neighbor.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Currently I think the mood in parliament&hellip; includes the possibility to go without Sweden,&rdquo;</em> the FM <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/finland-prepared-to-join-nato-without-sweden-says-minister-1.4863460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the Irish Times in an interview last week. <em>&ldquo;It would be good to do the same things at the same time as Sweden, but that depends on Swedish decisions. It is too early to guess the date, but I think before the summer we are proceeding.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Addressing journalists after Scholz on Tuesday, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said a decision had not yet been made and that <em>&ldquo;All options are on the table,&rdquo;</em> comments echoed by Finland&rsquo;s prime minister, Sanna Marin.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Finland and Sweden are facing important decisions regarding their own security,&rdquo;</em> Marin said, adding that <em>&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s attack on Ukraine has dramatically changed our security environment, and that cannot be undone.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The German chancellor similarly <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/meseberg/klausur-kabinett-2029028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labeled</a> Russia&rsquo;s military operation a <em>&ldquo;turning point&rdquo;</em> for security on the continent, saying the attack prompted Berlin to scrap a long-held policy against shipping weapons into active conflict zones. <em>&ldquo;It was right and necessary&rdquo;</em> to change that policy, Scholz continued, adding,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;we are now providing large-scale support [to Ukraine], which we will continue to do.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has demanded the <em>&ldquo;strongest possible&rdquo;</em> retaliation to Russia&rsquo;s attack on Ukraine&nbsp;following meetings with officials in Warsaw and Kiev.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>In comments after a sit-down with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Monday, Pelosi said Washington and its allies must escalate their efforts against Moscow, calling for the <em>&ldquo;strongest possible military response&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;the strongest sanctions&rdquo;</em> in order to <em>&ldquo;make the case that this is not tolerable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t do anything less because of a threat from Russia,&rdquo;</em> she continued, arguing that it had <em>&ldquo;already delivered&rdquo;</em> on that threat by attacking its neighbor.</p>
<p>The House speaker also noted that the US delegation <em>&ldquo;discussed the centrality of the US-Poland partnership in delivering security, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> as well as <em>&ldquo;the importance of bolstering the NATO alliance.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong></strong>Both nations have devoted significant amounts of military gear and other assistance to Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, with Washington spending tens of billions to furnish the country with heavy artillery, drones, helicopters, armored vehicles, ammunition, and small arms, among other weapons. Western nations have also embarked on a heavy sanctions campaign seeking to <em>&ldquo;isolate&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;cripple&rdquo;</em> the Russian economy in response to the military operation.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In his own statement following the meeting, President Duda said the two sides also discussed how to further strengthen NATO&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;eastern flank,&rdquo;</em> after several <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/552590-nato-sending-battlegroups-eastern-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US deployments</a> pushed troop levels in Europe beyond 140,000, many stationed in the east.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Warsaw has made a number of major security proposals for both itself and Ukraine in recent weeks, calling on the United States to facilitate the transfer of warplanes to Kiev, as well as for US troop and even <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553214-polish-official-wants-us-nukes-eastern-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuclear deployments</a> on Polish soil. Russian officials have repeatedly <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554918-macron-putin-ukraine-readout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged against</a> additional arms deliveries to Ukraine, and have <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/553431-peskov-poland-nuclear-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> that the stationing of nuclear weapons in Poland would trigger a response in kind from Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s visit to Poland followed a &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; stop in Kiev last weekend, where she and fellow US lawmakers met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other top officials. In a statement after that trip, Pelosi declared that <em>&ldquo;America stands firmly with Ukraine&rdquo;</em> and will <em>&ldquo;be there for you until the fight is done.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>At a missile plant in Alabama, President Biden bragged about Ukrainian parents naming children after Javelins</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday described the conflict in Ukraine as a historic <em>&ldquo;inflection point [that] comes along every six or eight generations,&rdquo;</em> and described the US&rsquo; role in the conflict as fighting the first <em>&ldquo;real battle&rdquo;</em> in a civilizational struggle versus Russia and China. Biden also promised to send billions more dollars worth of aid to Kiev.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at an inflection point in history. It comes along about every six or eight generations,&rdquo;</em> Biden said, during a visit to a Lockheed Martin factory in Alabama, adding that <em>&ldquo;things are changing so rapidly that we have to be in control.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is unclear what the last <em>&ldquo;inflection point&rdquo;</em> referenced by Biden was, with six to eight generations describing anywhere between 100 and 200 years ago. However, Biden went on to describe the US&rsquo; mission in Ukraine in grander terms than simply shipping arms to an ally.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an ongoing battle between autocracy and democracy,&rdquo;</em> he said, referring to China and Russia as enemies of supposed Western <em>&ldquo;democracies.&rdquo;</em> The conflict in Ukraine, he added, is <em>&ldquo;the first real battle&rdquo;</em> in this clash of civilizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington&rsquo;s rhetoric on Ukraine has hardened in recent weeks, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554484-pentagon-wants-weakened-russia-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stating</a> that <em>&ldquo;we want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can&rsquo;t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> and Biden himself appearing to call for a regime change in Moscow on several occasions.</p>
<p>Russia is already treating the conflict as a de-facto war against NATO, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accusing the US-led military alliance of <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy.&rdquo;</em> Biden also apparently acknowledged on Tuesday that the US was engaged in a proxy war with Russia, telling workers at the Lockheed Martin plant that American weapons shipments were <em>&ldquo;making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves without us having to risk getting in a third world war by sending American soldiers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On top of this harder rhetoric, Biden has requested an additional $33 billion &ndash; which amounts to nearly half of Russia&rsquo;s whole 2021 defense budget &ndash; in military aid for Ukraine, as well as funding for US government agencies involved in the country. Touting the importance of the Javelin anti-tank missiles made in the Alabama plant to Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort, Biden compared the unprecedented weapons splurge to the US arming of its allies in World War II.</p>
<p>Biden, known for his frequent verbal slip-ups, <a href="https://t.me/breaking911/6993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared</a> to confuse Russia for Ukraine when he said that prior to the launch of Russia&rsquo;s military operation in February, <em>&ldquo;we made sure Russia had javelins and other weapons &hellip; so Ukraine was ready for whatever happened.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Biden also told his audience that Ukrainian parents are naming their newborn children <em>&ldquo;Javelin or Javelina&rdquo;</em> in honor of the American-made missiles. This <a href="https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1511069629644427267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claim</a> was originally made last month by Ukrainian journalist and neo-Nazi Azov regiment <a href="https://twitter.com/iaponomarenko/status/1120407477659553792?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">member</a> Ilya Ponomarenko.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden on sending Javelins to Ukraine: &quot;they&#39;ve been so important that there are stories of Ukrainian parents naming their newborn children &#39;Javelin&#39; or &#39;Javelina.&#39;&quot;<br><br>(this is a fine, very normal thing to say.) <a href="https://t.co/PHyxkllgHD">pic.twitter.com/PHyxkllgHD</a></p>&mdash; Meara (@MillennialOther) <a href="https://twitter.com/MillennialOther/status/1521569076048449540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>As Biden spoke of China&rsquo;s role in the global order in Alabama, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, <a href="https://twitter.com/DeptofDefense/status/1521525253234737158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Senate</a> that the US is <em>&ldquo;now facing two global powers, China and Russia,&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;the potential for significant international conflict between great powers is increasing.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>The Smithsonian Museum has officially admitted many of its celebrated collections were obtained unethically &ndash; essentially looted &ndash; in a <a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-adopts-policy-ethical-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published on Tuesday. Observing that &ldquo;<em>many artifacts and works of art have been in the Smithsonian&rsquo;s holdings for decades or, in some cases, more than 150 years</em>,&rdquo; the museum acknowledged that &ldquo;<em>ethical norms and best practices in collecting have changed, particularly with respect to collecting cultural heritage from individuals and communities.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The Smithsonian has collections it would not have acquired under present-day standards.</strong></em></p>

<p>The statement comes a year after a group of curators and collection specialists began contemplating whether the Smithsonian network of museums should come up with a &ldquo;<em>shared stewardship</em>&rdquo; policy that would allow the temporary return of looted, stolen, or otherwise unethically-obtained collections. The policy will focus particularly on repatriating or agreeing on shared stewardship of human remains, especially those acquired without the consent of the individual in question or their family, the policy notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<em>ethical returns policy</em>&rdquo; took effect on April 29 and will apply to all Smithsonian museums, though given the wide range of artifacts on display at the various sites, it will be implemented differently from location to location.</p>
<p>Individual museums will decide on criteria and procedures for &ldquo;deaccessioning and returning collections for ethical reasons, with occasional interventions by the parent organization&rsquo;s Board of Regents when the collections in question are of &ldquo;<em>significant monetary value, research or historical value, or when the deaccession might create significant public interest</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The principles as outlined in the museum&rsquo;s news release state that &ldquo;past acquisitions raising ethical concerns should be investigated and addressed in a manner consistent with current ethical standards,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;<em>being proactive</em>&rdquo; is preferable to being &ldquo;<em>simply responsive</em>&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. responding to scandals &ndash; in addressing issues related to past collecting.</p>
<p>The museum also acknowledged that it has collected &ldquo;<em>in a manner that has caused harm or benefited from unequal power relationships</em>,&rdquo; admitting that while it was impossible to deny the role of predatory practices in the accumulation of the museums&rsquo; impressive hoards, &ldquo;<em>they must have no part in our future interactions and collecting.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite its rapacious past, the museum has vowed to go forward with a &ldquo;<em>commitment to implement policies that respond in a transparent and timely manner to requests for return or shared stewardship.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even before releasing its policy on &ldquo;<em>ethical returns</em>,&rdquo; the Smithsonian pledged in March to repatriate 39 bronze sculptures to Nigeria, which has been demanding the return of the 'Benin Bronzes' for decades. The museum erected a display of photographs in their place and a sign declaring that the organization recognized &ldquo;<em>the trauma, violence and loss such displays of stolen artistic and cultural heritage can inflict on the victims of those crimes, their descendants, and broader communities.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the sculptures were ransacked from Benin City in 1897 by the British, who &ndash; according to the Smithsonian&rsquo;s website &ndash; &ldquo;<em>confiscated all the royal treasures, giving some to individual officers but taking most to auction in London to pay for the cost of the expedition. The looted objects eventually made their way into museum and private collections around the world.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such morally questionable distribution routes are responsible for much of the pre-colonial art that has landed in western museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which repatriated its own works from the Benin Bronzes collection last year. The museum also returned a tenth-century Nepalese sculpture looted from a temple in the Kathmandu Valley.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution describes itself as &ldquo;<em>the world&rsquo;s largest museum, education, and research complex</em>.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The UK military is now investigating how the imposter breached the supposedly high-security base</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The British military said on Tuesday that it had launched an investigation after reports that a man posing as a priest managed to infiltrate the barracks of the Coldstream Guards. The imposter socialized with the elite soldiers tasked with protecting the Queen, spending a night at Victoria Barracks near Windsor Castle.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The army takes this breach of security extremely seriously and it will be thoroughly investigated as a matter of priority,&rdquo;</em> a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said, but declined to comment further as the incident was now <em>&ldquo;part of an ongoing investigation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The breach, which occurred last week, was first reported by The Sun on Monday. According to the tabloid&rsquo;s source, the man showed up at the barracks&rsquo; gate and successfully conned his way in without showing any identification or presenting credentials.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The guy turned up at the gate, said his name was Father Cruise and claimed to be a friend of the battalion&rsquo;s Padre, the Reverend Matt Coles. He was invited in and offered something to eat,&rdquo;</em> the source said.</p>
<p>The phony priest promptly befriended the guardsmen at the facility and <em>&ldquo;within a couple of hours he was drinking with the officers in the bar.&rdquo;</em> The conman entertained his new friends with&nbsp;increasingly improbable stories over the drinks, bragging about serving during the Iraq War and claiming to have received a medal for bravery.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He was telling lots of tall stories and the lads were enjoying his banter,&rdquo;</em> the source claimed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It was only later when he started talking about how he had worked as an ejector-seat test pilot and had some organs replaced that the chaps started to get suspicious.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite said <em>&ldquo;suspicions,&rdquo;</em> the phony priest was still offered a bed at the barracks and spent the night there. The man was inspected only in the morning and the police were called to the barracks, removing the impostor from the building. The man was not arrested and no further action against him has been taken so far.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>With no ally in the region willing to host US missiles, Washington should encourage Japan’s rearmament instead, says a new report</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>None of the US allies in the Pacific are currently willing to host intermediate-range missiles, says a new report by the RAND corporation, a think-tank tasked with developing strategies for the Pentagon. Instead, its author advises, Washington should encourage Japan to develop a missile arsenal of its own in order to threaten Chinese ships.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Within days of the US pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in August 2019, the Pentagon revealed it was <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/465681-us-missile-development-inf/">working on</a> previously banned missiles and <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/465733-pentagon-midrange-missiles-asia/">wanting to station</a> them somewhere on the Pacific rim. As RAND analyst Jeffrey W. Hornung points out, that seems to be easier said than done.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In the report, which RAND <a href="https://twitter.com/RANDCorporation/status/1521283398538510336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicized</a> on Monday, Hornung argues that <em>&ldquo;the likely receptivity to hosting such systems is very low as long as current domestic political conditions and regional security trends hold,&rdquo;</em> pointing specifically to Thailand, Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and Japan.</p>
<p><strong></strong>So long as Thailand has a <em>&ldquo;military-backed government&rdquo;</em> that <em>&ldquo;shows a propensity to pursue closer ties with China,&rdquo;</em> the US wouldn&rsquo;t want to base missiles there &ndash; and the Thai would be unlikely to accept if asked &ndash; Hornung said.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The Philippines are also <em>&ldquo;extremely unlikely&rdquo;</em> to accept US missiles. Even though <em>&ldquo;the Philippine public and elites generally support the United States and the alliance, President Rodrigo Duterte has pursued policies that negatively affect ties,&rdquo;</em> Hornung wrote.</p>
<p><strong></strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/551435-china-us-taiwan-pacific-ukraine/"></a>According to the report, the government of South Korea (ROK) also has ties to China and is susceptible to Chinese pressure, with Seoul <em>&ldquo;highly unlikely&rdquo;</em> to consent to hosting US missiles amid <em>&ldquo;a general deterioration of US-ROK relations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>While Australia seems like a good candidate, especially after the 2021 AUKUS submarine pact and other developments, Canberra is known for &ldquo;historical reluctance to host permanent foreign bases.&rdquo; Australia is also just too far from China for the ground-based intermediate-range missile systems (GBIRM) to be effective.</p>
<p>Even Japan, which is willing to <em>&ldquo;bolster its own defense capabilities vis-&agrave;-vis China,&rdquo;</em> is reluctant to accept any increase in the US military presence or <em>&ldquo;deploying weapons that are explicitly offensive in nature,&rdquo;</em> the report notes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Any US strategy that relies on an ally permanently hosting GBIRM <em>&ldquo;would face serious risks of failure due to an inability to find a willing partner,&rdquo;</em> Hornung writes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong>Instead, he argues the US should <em>&ldquo;help Japan in its efforts to </em><em>develop and deploy an arsenal of ground-based, anti-ship standoff missile capabilities,&rdquo;</em> which could eventually lead to Tokyo being willing to deploy anti-ship cruise missiles with longer ranges.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Although these missiles still would not be capable of deep strikes into China, if they were deployed on Japan&rsquo;s southwestern islands or even Kyushu, they would be able to cover ship movements in the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, and some of China&rsquo;s east coast, thereby extending the range at which Chinese assets could be held at war-planning risk and potentially contributing to a maritime interdiction mission in the Taiwan Strait,&rdquo;</em> the report concludes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CN&nbsp;was informed via email on Sunday that it couldn't<em>&nbsp;</em>use PayPal anymore&nbsp;and told &ldquo;w<em>e noticed activity in your account that&rsquo;s inconsistent with our User Agreement and we [can] no longer offer you PayPal services</em>.&rdquo; Absent any further explanation beyond the desire to limit &ldquo;<em>potential risk exposure</em>,&rdquo; the site was informed that the nearly $10,000 sitting in its account would be effectively confiscated for &ldquo;<em>up to 180 days</em>,&rdquo; after which point, &ldquo;<em>if applicable, we&rsquo;ll email you with information on how to withdraw any remaining money.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seizure came at a particularly damaging time for the reader-funded site, which had just begun a spring fundraising drive. Contacted by CN employees, a PayPal customer service representative confirmed on Sunday that no specific reason had been given by the &ldquo;<em>back office</em>&rdquo; for &ldquo;<em>permanently limiting</em>&rdquo; the account other than the aforementioned &ldquo;<em>potential risk</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t see any existing case</em>&rdquo; of a complaint having been filed by &ldquo;<em>any agency, government or private, or any individual</em>,&rdquo; they told CN, promising to ask PayPal&rsquo;s back office to explain its behavior to the website.</p>
<p>More ominously, the PayPal representative informed CN&nbsp;that &ldquo;<em>if there was a violation</em>,&rdquo; it was &ldquo;<em>possible</em>&rdquo; the $9,348.14 balance in its account would be kept by PayPal as &ldquo;<em>damages</em>.&rdquo; According to PayPal&rsquo;s own documentation, violations include providing &ldquo;<em>false, inaccurate or misleading information</em>&rdquo; to PayPal, its customers, or &ldquo;<em>third parties.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2022/05/01/paypal-cancels-cn-account-may-seize-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> discussing the suspension, CN editor-in-chief Joe Lauria suggested the site had been targeted due to its coverage of the conflict in Ukraine, noting that MintPress News &ndash; another well-known alt-media website with similar political views regarding the US and NATO's foreign adventures &ndash; had its own account frozen by PayPal last week. PayPal&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;<em>violations</em>,&rdquo; Lauria implied, could easily be stretched to include the Orwellian crime du jour of &ldquo;fake news,&rdquo; an especially egregious offense during wartime.</p>
<p>Last week, former RT America correspondent Caleb Maupin also had his PayPal account frozen without warning or explanation, as did MintPress employees Alan MacLeod and Mnar Adley. Many on social media have speculated that the payment processor is deliberately targeting those with dissident views on the conflict in Ukraine and US foreign policy in general &ndash; &ldquo;<em>thoughtcrimes</em>&rdquo; hundreds of other prominent commentators have been deplatformed for in the past.</p>
<p>Consortium News was founded in 1995 by the late journalist Robert Parry, whose claims to fame included exposing the Iran-Contra scandal, in opposition to what the site&rsquo;s own biography describes as &ldquo;<em>a crisis building in the US news media</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skewering the &ldquo;<em>pattern of groupthink on issue after issue, often ignoring important factual information because it didn&rsquo;t fit with what all the Important People knew to be true</em>,&rdquo;</p>

<p>PayPal was sued in a class-action lawsuit in January, accused of violating racketeering laws, including breach of contract and unjust enrichment, for refusing to explain the reasoning behind its decision to freeze several customer accounts.</p>
<p>Famed poker professional Chris Moneymaker was to be the lead plaintiff after having $12,000 of his money confiscated by the website, but after publicity began to build around the lawsuit, PayPal refunded his earnings. Nevertheless, several other plaintiffs stepped in to replace him, including fellow poker professional Lena Evans, who alleged the payment processor had first frozen and then stolen $26,984 from her account.</p>
<p>PayPal&rsquo;s terms of service prohibit customers from using the platform for &ldquo;<em>illegal activities</em>,&rdquo; including covering gambling expenses, but the lawsuit argues the payment processor cannot simply confiscate funds from customers who violate those terms.</p>

                            <p><strong>Billionaire responds to allegations of cheating on his then-wife and meeting repeatedly with Jeffrey Epstein</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>One year on from announcing his divorce, billionaire Bill Gates has responded to accusations that he was unfaithful to his then-wife, acknowledging that he&rsquo;s to blame for <em>&ldquo;causing a lot of pain to my family.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I certainly made mistakes, and I take responsibility,&rdquo;</em> Gates said on Tuesday in an NBC News interview. Pressed by <em>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;</em> show host Savannah Guthrie about allegations that multiple affairs contributed to the breakup of his 27-year marriage to Melinda Gates, he said, <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain, and I feel terrible about that.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The 66-year-old Microsoft co-founder and vaccine promoter emphasized that he and his ex-wife continue to work together on their philanthropic foundation, but he said the divorce was <em>&ldquo;sad and tragic.&rdquo;</em> Asked what he learned through the experience, Gates paused awkwardly, then said his expertise is about such topics as climate change and health care. On personal matters, he added, <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have great advice for other people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Asked about the difficulty of watching a CBS News interview his ex-wife did last month &ndash; in which she described <em>&ldquo;lying on the floor crying&rdquo;</em> at times during her marriage &ndash; Gates said, <em>&ldquo;This was a very tough thing. We had a lot of amazing things in our marriage. The kids, the foundation, the enjoyment we had. And so it's a very hard adjustment. I know divorces are different, but it's just a complete change. We were partners, we kind of grew up together, and now that's different. We're not married.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>During the CBS interview, Melinda Gates said her then-husband&rsquo;s relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was one of the reasons for the divorce. Bill Gates called his decision to meet with Epstein multiple times a <em>&ldquo;huge mistake,&rdquo;</em> adding, <em>&ldquo;I had a goal of raising money for global health. I didn&rsquo;t realize that the meeting with him almost downplayed the incredibly awful things he did. I learned more about that over time, but I add that to the list of big mistakes, including where Melinda&rsquo;s advice was sound and I should have followed it sooner than I did.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Epstein died in a New York jail cell in August 2019, allegedly by suicide, while awaiting trial on charges of child sex trafficking. Asked whether he ever saw anything with Epstein that made him think, <em>&ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t feel right,&rdquo;</em> Gates replied, <em>&ldquo;He was a bad person, and I had a reason that I thought those meetings would lead to something good, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have done them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Gates did the interview to promote his new book, titled <em>&lsquo;How to Prevent the Next Pandemic.&rsquo;</em> He blamed <em>&ldquo;misinformation&rdquo;</em> for killing Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic and said it was hard to understand why he was targeted with <em>&ldquo;conspiracy theories&rdquo;</em> after supporting vaccines that saved lives.</p>

<p>Guthrie suggested that billionaire Elon Musk&rsquo;s pending acquisition of Twitter &ndash; and plans to restore freedom of speech on the social media platform &ndash; might give cause for greater concern about misinformation. Asked whether he worries about Musk, Gates said, <em>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to underestimate Elon. What he did at Tesla is amazing, helping with climate change, what he did at SpaceX.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You know, will he, this time, make that improvement? Should there be laws that strike a better balance of free speech versus conspiracy theories confusing people? Elon thinks he can improve Twitter. I don&rsquo;t know specifically what he&rsquo;ll do, but there&rsquo;s an opportunity, and we need innovation in that space.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Nearly 60% of adults are overweight or obese, the UN health watchdog has said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Obesity rates have reached <em>&ldquo;epidemic proportions&rdquo;</em> in Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. The issue was highlighted in a major report unveiled at the European Congress on Obesity on Tuesday</p>
<p>The rates are <em>&ldquo;still escalating,&rdquo;</em> the health watchdog warned, stating that no country in the region was expected to meet the WHO global noncommunicable disease (NCD) goal of halting rising obesity rates by 2025.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Alarmingly, there have been consistent increases in prevalence of overweight and obesity, and not a single Member State of the Region is on track to reach the target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025,&rdquo;</em> the report reads.</p>
<p>The disease is contributing to some 1.2 million deaths and causing some 200,000 cases of cancer in the region annually. This figure is set to grow further, and in some countries obesity is projected to overtake other cancer risk factors, including even smoking, the report says.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Across the WHO European region, obesity is likely to be directly responsible for at least 200,000 new cancer cases annually, with this figure projected to rise in the coming decades,&rdquo;</em> the document reads.</p>

<p>Currently, some 59% of adults in Europe are either overweight or obese, according to the WHO figures. The issue is affecting children as well: some 7.9% of children under the age of five &ndash; numbering around 4.4 million &ndash; are already experiencing problems with excess body weight.</p>
<p>The situation is significantly worse among school-aged children, of whom some one in three is overweight. The trend <em>&ldquo;decreases temporarily in adolescents,&rdquo;</em> with around a quarter afflicted. Obesity is higher in Europe than in any other region in the world except the Americas, the report said.</p>
<p>A comprehensive approach must be taken to tackle the issue, the WHO said, admitting that <em>&ldquo;no single intervention can halt the rise of the growing epidemic.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The proposed measures include increased taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and subsidies for healthy foods, restrictions on advertising of unhealthy foods for children, as well as <em>&ldquo;improvement of access to obesity and overweight management services in primary health care, as part of universal health coverage.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The staffer who leaked the draft opinion overturning the abortion law “will not succeed” in undermining the Supreme Court’s work, the chief justice wrote</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has ordered the court&rsquo;s marshal to investigate the source of a leaked draft opinion showing that its justices would imminently strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Conservatives suspect that a liberal clerk leaked the document to generate public outcry and force the court to backtrack.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Yesterday, a news organization published a copy of a draft opinion in a pending case,&rdquo;</em> Roberts, a conservative, wrote on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,&rdquo;</em> he continued. <em>&ldquo;The work of the Court will not be affected in any way.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Politico on Monday published the draft decision, which stated that the court had voted by 5-3, with one vote undecided, to overturn Roe v. Wade, a 1973 ruling that guaranteed the absolute right to a first-trimester abortion and limited rights in the second. A 1992 ruling upholding Roe v. Wade &ndash; Planned Parenthood v. Casey &ndash; would also be overturned.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Chief Justice John Roberts has directed the marshal of the Supreme Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, which Roberts verified as an authentic document <a href="https://t.co/vcq4lTY7bk">pic.twitter.com/vcq4lTY7bk</a></p>&mdash; John Kruzel (@johnkruzel) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1521508763861192706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Writing the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito declared that the US Constitution offered no right to abortion, and that Roe v. Wade rested on an <em>&ldquo;egregiously wrong&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;exceptionally weak&rdquo;</em> interpretation of the country&rsquo;s founding document. Striking down this ruling would <em>&ldquo;return the issue of abortion to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives&rdquo;</em> on the state level, he wrote.</p>
<p>Conservative lawmakers and pundits view the leak as a calculated effort by a liberal staffer within the court to force the abortion debate into the open and generate public outrage, potentially motivating the court&rsquo;s justices to change their minds, or Congress to legislate on abortion rights.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,&rdquo;</em> Roberts continued, adding that he has <em>&ldquo;directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The leak was unprecedented for an institution that operates mostly behind closed doors. While the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling was leaked to the press, it was published mere hours before being announced by the court and had already been finalized. This time around, the court is not set to issue its final ruling in the Mississippi case that brought Roe v. Wade before it until June.</p>
<p>Prominent Democrats, including the governors of California and New Jersey, have already announced plans to pass abortion rights legislation on the state level, while President Joe Biden has called on <em>&ldquo;elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman&rsquo;s right to choose,&rdquo;</em> adding that he would sign potential legislation codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law.</p>

                            <p><strong>Taipei is weighing other options after its howitzer order was left behind on American production lines amid the Ukraine crisis</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwanese defense officials have been forced to regroup on plans for artillery forces after being told that the US has pushed back the estimated delivery date for 40 howitzer systems by at least three years as Washington races to supply more weapons to war-torn Ukraine.</p>
<p>Taipei&rsquo;s $750 million order was <em>&ldquo;crowded out&rdquo;</em> of US production lines, delaying delivery to 2026 at the soonest, rather than starting in 2023 as planned, Taiwan&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mnd.gov.tw/Publish.aspx?p=79830&amp;title=%e5%9c%8b%e9%98%b2%e6%b6%88%e6%81%af&amp;SelectStyle=%e6%96%b0%e8%81%9e%e7%a8%bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a> said on Monday. As a result, the ministry is looking at other available weapons systems, such as truck-based rocket launchers produced by Lockheed Martin Corp., to fill the void and will submit a budget proposal once a decision has been made.</p>
<p>Taiwan is trying to modernize its military with precision and long-range weaponry to fend off a possible attack by mainland China, which considers the republic to be a breakaway province. The artillery order was approved last year, making it Taiwan&rsquo;s first arms deal with the US since President Joe Biden took office, and it was to include 40 155mm M109A6 self-propelled <em>&ldquo;Paladin&rdquo;</em> howitzer systems. It also covered related equipment, such as support vehicles and precision guidance kits.</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s administration has ramped up the delivery of heavy weapons, including howitzers, to Ukraine to help Kiev repel Russian forces. Washington has pledged 90 howitzers and 140,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition to Kiev as part of about $15 billion in promised <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554871-howitzers-ukraine-pentagon-javelins/">weaponry</a>. Biden is seeking lawmaker approval for $33 billion in additional aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the administration&rsquo;s refusal to send American troops to fight Russians in Ukraine have called into question Washington&rsquo;s commitment to protecting Taiwan. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week vowed that the administration would make sure Taiwan had <em>&ldquo;all necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Taiwanese officials are watching the Ukraine conflict <em>&ldquo;very carefully&rdquo;</em> and are examining <em>&ldquo;what we can learn from Ukraine in defending ourselves,&rdquo;</em> the disputed island republic&rsquo;s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told CNN on Sunday. He added, <em>&ldquo;I think the Chinese government must be thinking or calculating how the US or other major countries are going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help or whether they&rsquo;re going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help. If Taiwan does not have any support, I think that&rsquo;s going to be a green light to aggression.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The president has called on Americans to elect pro-choice lawmakers in the midterms</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Commenting on reports that the US Supreme Court is preparing to overturn the precedent allowing abortion, President Joe Biden on Tuesday called on Americans to support pro-abortion officials in the coming midterm elections, so Congress can make it a law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday evening, Politico published a 98-page document suggesting the court is willing to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade and 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey rulings, two precedents that have made abortion legal in the US without an act of Congress. The document, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, has since been confirmed as genuine.</p>
<p>If the court does overturn Roe, <em>&ldquo;it will fall on our nation&rsquo;s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman&rsquo;s right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November,&rdquo;</em> Biden said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/03/statement-by-president-joe-biden-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Tuesday morning. <em>&ldquo;At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s Democrats, most of whom favor legalized abortion, currently have the majority in the House and control the 50-50 Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. However, current polling suggests they may lose both chambers in November.</p>
<p>The president noted that his government&rsquo;s lawyers had <em>&ldquo;argued strongly&rdquo;</em> in defense of Roe before the Supreme Court, saying that it was based on <em>&ldquo;a long line of precedent&hellip; against government interference with intensely personal decisions.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I believe that a woman&rsquo;s right to choose is fundamental, Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,&rdquo;</em> Biden added.</p>
<p>Moreover, his Gender Policy Council and the White House Counsel&rsquo;s Office are preparing options to address <em>&ldquo;the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes in the cases pending before the Supreme Court,&rdquo; </em>Biden said.<em> &ldquo;We will be ready when any ruling is issued.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling that abortion emanates from the fundamental constitutional right to privacy is almost as old as Biden&rsquo;s political career. He was sworn in as senator in January 1973, just weeks before Roe was announced, and has both proposed and opposed abortion-related legislation over the years. <em>&ldquo;His back-and-forth over abortion has been a hallmark of his career,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;was how the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/us/politics/biden-abortion-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> put it in 2019.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, in follow-up remarks to the White House press pool, Biden said that reversing Roe would be <em>&ldquo;a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence&rdquo;</em> that could affect same-sex marriage or birth control too.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not willing to leave that to the whims of the public in local areas,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts has confirmed that the leaked document was authentic, but does not represent the court&rsquo;s final decision. He said he has ordered an investigation into the leak, and called it <em>&ldquo;a singular and egregious breach&rdquo;</em> of trust among a workforce that is <em>&ldquo;intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed. The work of the Court will not be affected in any way,&rdquo;</em> Roberts said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1521508763861192706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>&ldquo;I have no doubt that the Chief Justice will work to root out the radical activist that betrayed the sacred tradition of the court,&rdquo;</em> Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1521441577272549378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;The leaker must be immediately removed from their position and exiled from the legal community.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hours earlier, Politico published a draft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554889-abortion-rights-us-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a> suggesting that the Supreme Court, by five votes to three, had decided to overturn Roe v. Wade, a 1973 ruling that guaranteed the absolute right to a first-trimester abortion and limited rights in the second. A 1992 ruling upholding Roe v. Wade &ndash; Planned Parenthood v. Casey &ndash; would also be overturned.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,&rdquo;</em> conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a draft majority opinion. Alito argued that as the US Constitution makes no mention of the right to terminate pregnancy, <em>&ldquo;it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives&rdquo;</em> on the state level.</p>
<p>Conservative lawmakers and pundits suspected that the decision was leaked by a liberal clerk in a bid to generate public outrage and force the court to reconsider. One clerk working for Justice Sonia Sotomayor has already been touted as the likely culprit, though this has not been proven.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is a blatant attempt to intimidate the court through public pressure rather than reasoned argument,&rdquo;</em> Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas)&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/1521325951119933445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. <em>&ldquo;I hope my fellow former clerks and the entire legal community will join me in denouncing this egregious breach of trust.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This leak has to come from a clerk or Justice themselves,&rdquo;</em> an unnamed former clerk told conservative pundit&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1521310766397276160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benny Johnson</a>. <em>&ldquo;It is intended to blow up the court. Criminal investigation needs to happen now.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The leak is inexcusable and threatens the Court’s functioning. The most plausible explanation is that it’s someone on the left engaged in civil disobedience—so yet again it’s those who bemoan the “loss of norms” who break them. Cf. court-packing, attacking legitimacy, etc.</p>&mdash; Ilya Shapiro (@ishapiro) <a href="https://twitter.com/ishapiro/status/1521303521827635202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The release was described by many pro-life commentators as <em>&ldquo;unprecedented.&rdquo;</em> However, the court&rsquo;s rulings have been let out of the bag&nbsp;before. The original Roe v. Wade decision was published by Time magazine several hours before it was announced by the court, for example. However, the outcome in that case had already been determined, while the document published by Politico on Monday was a draft, and therefore subject to change.</p>
<p>Moreover, the court is not set to issue its opinion on Roe v. Wade until late June, when it will possibly rule on the Mississippi abortion case that put the 1973 precedent in its crosshairs.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ECampbell360/status/1521317197527851010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, Chief Justice John Roberts will likely order an FBI investigation. Meanwhile, crowds of pro- and anti-abortion protesters have gathered outside the court in Washington on Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The so-called proponents of freedom and democracy have given themselves the right to designate what the ‘truth’ is</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security announced last week that it had formed a &ldquo;Disinformation Governance Board&rdquo; to fight the spread of so-called disinformation on the Internet. While White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki didn&rsquo;t elaborate on how the bureau would operate, she suggested that it would monitor disinformation on topics like COVID-19 and elections.</p>
<p>Conservatives have often half-joked about George Orwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;1984&rdquo; becoming a reality, but it appears that the Biden administration has decided to literally take a page from the book and create a &ldquo;Ministry of Truth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s aim is to target &ldquo;disinformation,&rdquo; but what constitutes disinformation? Many times over the years we have seen complete censorship from government officials and Big Tech social media companies, most infamously during the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, which saw major tech platforms and politicians painting it as &ldquo;Russian propaganda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allowing the government to dictate what &ldquo;the truth&rdquo; is sets a dangerous precedent, as it instead promotes desired narratives to bolster poll numbers, ratings, or<a href="https://unherd.com/2022/01/how-the-government-abused-nudge-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> nudging the citizenry</a> into following government edicts &ndash; all on the basis of &ldquo;<em>trust us, we know what&rsquo;s best for you.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Facts be damned. Just do as you&rsquo;re told. This was seen multiple times during the pandemic era, when both Dr. Anthony Fauci and then-Surgeon General Jerome Adams hummed and harred over mask-wearing and social distancing &ndash; first instructing the public not to wear masks, and then much later calling it a necessity.</p>
<p>Gatekeeping discourse is a surefire way to control the narrative, controlling what people see, what they say, and ultimately &ndash; what they believe. It&rsquo;s also an effective means to silence dissent, and quash those who might speak out against the regime&rsquo;s approved narrative &ndash; or even the regime itself.</p>
<p>The new Ministry of Truth is a tool, and there is no reality in which this tool will not be used for bad intent &ndash; and it&rsquo;ll claim to be doing it all in the name of the greater good.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Ministry of Truth was rushed into creation seemingly as a reaction to &ldquo;free speech absolutist&rdquo; Elon Musk&rsquo;s purchase of the social media platform, Twitter, the de facto town square of political discourse and public narratives.</p>
<p>With the relinquishment of Twitter to Musk, those who control mainstream narratives fear they will lose out on an important resource, and will no longer be able to promote narratives and fix algorithms to sway public opinion &ndash; at least not with ease. There will be pushback, and their positions are not ones they are willing to defend, hence why the creation of this new tool is necessary. It keeps the plebeians in check.</p>
<p>Free speech, which in Musk&rsquo;s belief is &ldquo;<em>essential to a functioning democracy,</em>&rdquo; flies directly in the face of the Biden administration&rsquo;s attempts to crack down on viewpoints that contradict the regime&rsquo;s official narrative. And who better to head the Disinformation Governance Board than Nina Jankowicz, who herself perpetuated several regime-approved falsehoods?</p>

<p>Jankowicz, who previously advised the Ukrainian government on disinformation and strategic communications under the auspices of a Fulbright-Clinton Public Policy Fellowship,<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10770479/Bidens-new-disinformation-czar-not-removed-apologized-tweets-masks-Trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> voiced her support for Christopher Steele</a>, whose infamous &ldquo;Steele dossier&rdquo; on Russian election interference during Donald Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election dogged the presidency for years. Despite Steele&rsquo;s loss of credibility, Jankowicz hyped up the former spy in August 2020 as being able to offer &ldquo;<em>some great historical context about the evolution of disinfo</em>&rdquo; when he spoke on a podcast about the topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the infamous dossier, which included the unverifiable claim that Russia had &ldquo;kompromat&rdquo; on Trump in the form of a sex tape, has since been entirely discredited. Steele&rsquo;s main source, Igor Danchenko, was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/us/politics/igor-danchenko-arrested-steele-dossier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> later charged with five counts</a> of making false statements to the FBI. Jankowicz also repeated the<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/disinformation-head-nina-jankowicz-hunter-biden-laptop-remarks-1701654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> unproven theory</a> that<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop</a> was the product of a Russian disinformation campaign, spread by members of the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Back on the &lsquo;laptop from hell,&rsquo; apparently&mdash;Biden notes 50 former natsec officials and 5 former CIA heads that believe the laptop is a Russian influence op</em>,&rdquo; Jankowicz said on Twitter. &ldquo;<em>Trump says &lsquo;Russia, Russia, Russia.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She attempted to distance herself from her remarks with the claim that she was simply livetweeting Trump&rsquo;s first presidential debate with Biden. However, when solicited by the Associated Press in October 2020 for her thoughts on the laptop, Jankowicz told the publication that &ldquo;<em>We should view it as a Trump campaign product,&rdquo; dismissing the fact that the laptop belonged to Hunter Biden</em>.</p>
<p>As detailed by<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/disinformation-head-nina-jankowicz-hunter-biden-laptop-remarks-1701654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Newsweek</a>, Jankowicz continued to perpetuate doubt against the story, tweeting on October 22, 2020 that &ldquo;<em>The emails don't need to be altered to be part of an influence campaign. Voters deserve that context, not a [fairy] tale about a laptop repair shop.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a consolidated effort to disqualify the New York Post&rsquo;s original report on Hunter Biden&rsquo;s laptop as &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo;, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms banned the New York Post and prevented its users from sharing the story weeks ahead of the 2020 US presidential election. The original report on the laptop has since been validated by a comprehensive report about the ongoing federal probe into Hunter Biden&rsquo;s tax filings, published by the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/hunter-biden-tax-bill-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s then-CEO Jack Dorsey later admitted to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that censoring the report was a &ldquo;<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/17/jack-dorsey-admits-lockout-of-the-post-was-a-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total mistake</a>,&rdquo; and chalked up the decision to a &ldquo;process error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Twitter and Facebook heads were grilled over their companies&rsquo; perceived anti-conservative bias and penchant for censoring so-called &ldquo;disinformation,&rdquo; with the censorship usually aimed at conservatives. It&rsquo;s worth pointing out again that the now-discredited &ldquo;Steele dossier&rdquo; had no problem gaining traction when it first ran on BuzzFeed.</p>

<p>Nina Jankowicz had no problem spreading actual disinformation while helping to silence the truth under the auspices of &ldquo;combating disinformation.&rdquo; Given her predilection towards perpetuating anti-Russian narratives, one might ask if contradictory evidence to the &ldquo;Snake Island&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ghost of Kiev&rdquo; hoaxes constitute forms of &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; in her book. After all, the mainstream media is chiefly responsible for<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ghost-of-kyiv-who-shot-down-more-than-40-russian-aircraft-dies-in-battle-q3sq0hztx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> promoting these heroic war stories</a>, both of which were almost immediately discredited by the Russian media &ndash; and later by western experts. Even<a href="https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1520469409944551427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ukraine&rsquo;s own propagandists</a> were forced to instruct the public to stop promoting disinformation about the conflict. Would the Ministry of Truth move to silence such attacks on its credibility?</p>
<p>Those concerned with the truth must do everything in their power to resist the Biden administration&rsquo;s efforts to police the truth. To that end, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is one of the few American leaders who has stepped up and vowed to fight back against the Orwellian disinformation bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>They want to be able to put out false narratives without people being able to speak out and fight back,</em>&rdquo;<a href="https://www.rebelnews.com/ron_desantis_vows_to_challenge_biden_admins_proposed_ministry_of_truth"> DeSantis said</a>. &ldquo;<em>But we&rsquo;re not going to let Biden get away with this one, so we will be fighting back.</em>&rdquo; Referring to the regime as a &ldquo;<em>decaying and discredited ruling elite in this country</em>,&rdquo; DeSantis said: &ldquo;<em>We believe it&rsquo;s essential that individual Floridians and Americans are able to speak out against the false narratives trying to be jammed down our throats by this regime</em>.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Pope Francis has said that NATO&rsquo;s eastward expansion may have provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin into launching an attack against Ukraine.</p>
<p>In an interview published on Tuesday by Italian daily Corriere Della Sera, the pontiff speculated that<em> &ldquo;the barking of NATO at Russia&rsquo;s door&rdquo;</em> could have driven the Kremlin&nbsp;into launching the military campaign on February 24.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say if it was provoked, but perhaps, yes,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Francis also said he requested a meeting with Putin during the early weeks of the conflict, but has still not received a reply. He said he had asked the Vatican&rsquo;s top diplomat to contact the Russian president about setting up a meeting about three weeks into the hostilities.</p>
<p><em>"We have not yet received a response and we are still insisting,"</em> he told the paper.<em> "I fear that Putin cannot, and does not, want to have this meeting at this time. But how can you not stop so much brutality?"</em> he added.</p>

<p>The pontiff said he had earlier spoken with the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, for 40 minutes via Zoom. The Patriarch, who has made comments justifying Russia&rsquo;s offensive in Ukraine, <em>"cannot become Putin&rsquo;s altar boy,&rdquo; he insisted.</em></p>
<p>Francis also told the paper that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had assured him that Putin had a plan to end the war on May 9, the day when Russia celebrates the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>The pope had previously been criticized for not directly censuring Russia in the earliest days of the attack. In March, he called for a <em>&ldquo;a different way of governing the world&rdquo;</em> and urged civilization to overcome the reflexive need for <em>&ldquo;more weapons, more sanctions, more political-military alliances.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The country’s energy regulator predicted a 35% rise in prices following the suspension of Russian supplies</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Bulgarian industry workers are preparing to protest the rising gas prices, the executive director of the Bulgarian Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers (BFIEC), Ivaylo Naydenov, said on Monday following the recent suspension of Russian gas supplies.</p>
<p>In an interview with Radio Bulgaria, Naydenov said the federation has called on the government to take measures to reduce prices or at least keep them at current levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Otherwise, we will have no choice but to organize protests, as announced by the employers&rsquo; organizations,</em>&rdquo; Naydenov said.</p>
<p>He revealed that Prime Minister Kiril Petkov has already been informed by the BFIEC of the potential protests.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian government earlier announced that Petkov and two of his deputies would hold a meeting on May 5 with the representatives of employers&rsquo; organizations to discuss &ldquo;<em>prices on natural gas and electricity, as well as the measures required in response</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This follows remarks by the head of the BFIEC board, Konstantin Stamenov. Speaking on Monday to Nova News, he said members of the federation &ldquo;<em>definitely cannot accept a new price of gas</em>,&rdquo; and if there is no compensation, they are going to stage a protest &ndash; and the same warning applies to electricity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>There is a very limited possibility to replace gas with propane butane, but it is logistically impossible to deliver the quantities we need</em>,&rdquo; Stamenov said.</p>
<p>Moscow stopped exporting natural gas to Bulgaria and Poland on April 27, following their refusal to pay in rubles. Two days later, the head of Bulgaria&rsquo;s energy regulator, the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC), Stanislav Todorov, predicted a 35% rise in natural gas prices.</p>
<p>He explained the gloomy forecast by the fact that the country will now be fully dependent on the European markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Given the fact that we have to go to the free market and replace 80% of the deliveries that Gazprom supplied to Bulgaria and which they no longer want to supply to Bulgaria, we have to replace them with quantities from alternative suppliers. What we can expect for the price for May is that the prices in Bulgaria for gas will be equal to those in Europe,</em>&rdquo; Todorov said.</p>

<p>The largest Bulgarian natural gas distribution company, Bulgargaz, said it had taken preventative measures to protect consumers and ensure there will be no shortage of gas in May.</p>
<p>The company argued that if Bulgaria had accepted Moscow&rsquo;s demand to pay in rubles, the gas price would probably still &ldquo;<em>undergo unpredictable changes, given the lack of clarity on the exchange rate and the lack of ability of the Bulgarian side to exercise control over the currency conversion process</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The proposed mechanism implies real risks for the Bulgarian side from unilateral and uncontrolled suspension of supplies without providing the appropriate opportunity to seek liability from the Russian supplier,&rdquo;</em> Bulgargaz stated.</p>
<p>In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin set a requirement for states which had imposed sanctions on Russia and are still importing its gas, to use the ruble for transactions. Several buyers signaled willingness to accept Moscow&rsquo;s demands, but many others made it clear they would not.</p>
<p>Harsh sanctions were imposed on Russia by Western nations in response to Moscow&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine. The Russian government, which considers the measures unlawful and unjustified, has retaliated by imposing its own counter-sanctions on &ldquo;<em>unfriendly states.</em>&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Andrey Melnyk laid into Olaf Scholz for refusing to visit Kiev after the Ukrainian authorities snubbed the German president last month</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, has described the country&rsquo;s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, as an &ldquo;<em>offended liverwurst</em>&rdquo; over his refusal to pay a visit to Kiev after Ukrainian authorities snubbed German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in mid-April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>To play an offended liverwurst doesn&rsquo;t sound very statesmanlike,</em>&rdquo; Melnyk said, speaking to Germany&rsquo;s DPA news outlet on Tuesday, adding: &ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re talking about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine, it is no preschool.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ukrainian official noted, however, that his remark did not mean that Chancellor Scholz was not welcome in Kiev. More than &ldquo;<em>symbolic visits,</em>&rdquo; however, Melnyk said, Ukraine would appreciate Germany &ldquo;<em>implementing the Bundestag&rsquo;s motion on the delivery of heavy weapons and fulfilling the earlier promises.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diplomat also criticized Berlin for failing to provide ammunition for the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, which Germany pledged to ship to Ukraine in late April. The delivery would represent the first batch of heavy weaponry provided to Kiev by Berlin since Russia launched its offensive on February 24.</p>

<p>Melnyk&rsquo;s &lsquo;liverwurst&rsquo; comment came shortly after Chancellor Scholz told Germany&rsquo;s ZDF TV channel that Ukraine&rsquo;s refusal to receive President Steinmeier on April 13 stood in the way of Scholz&rsquo;s own potential visit to Kiev. Scholz described the snub as a &ldquo;<em>remarkable instance,</em>&rdquo; pointing out that Steinmeier was re-elected as president back in February and enjoyed support from the vast majority of German MPs at the time.</p>
<p>Steinmeier was supposed to pay a visit to Kiev along with the leaders of Poland and the Baltic states on April 13. However, the Ukrainian authorities signaled to him the day prior that he was &ldquo;<em>not wanted</em>&rdquo; in Kiev because he had fostered good relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>The German chancellor said it cannot be that Germany provided &ldquo;<em>so much military assistance, so much financial assistance</em>&rdquo; to Ukraine and then is told that the president cannot visit.</p>
<p>Ukraine has been critical of the German government for what it sees as lackluster military support and an unwillingness to make a clean break from Russian energy exports.</p>
<p>While serving as foreign minister in Angela Merkel&rsquo;s government, the president developed a plan of action to ensure the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which came to be known as the 'Steinmeier Formula'.</p>

<p>Aimed at ending the bloody conflict in the Donbass, the plan envisaged that the two breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk would hold elections under Ukrainian law and OSCE oversight, whereupon they would gain special self-governing status and return the control of their borders with Russia to Kiev.</p>
<p>Although given the green light by Ukraine, Russia, the OSCE and the two regions back in October 2019, the scheme, however, failed to materialize, as it was fiercely resisted by the nationalist opposition in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Peter Szijjarto said his country’s economy can’t function without Moscow's oil</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has claimed that his country has been receiving unjustified attacks for being honest about its dependence on energy supplies from Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at this issue solely from the perspective of Hungarian national interests. We&rsquo;re not interested in what the East or the West thinks about it,&rdquo;</em> Szijjarto said on Tuesday during a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart Mukhtar Tleuberdi.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The real security of supplies is an issue for us because it&rsquo;s currently physically impossible to run the Hungarian economy without Russian oil.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The minister stressed that Hungary gets around 65% of its oil from Russia through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline.</p>
<p>Budapest confirmed earlier that it will not back an embargo on Russian energy&nbsp;as part of EU sanctions on Moscow over its military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Szijjarto said that Hungary had voted for all of the previous sanctions packages but is still receiving <em>&ldquo;unjust and unfair&rdquo;</em> attacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>One of the reasons for this, of course, may be that we&rsquo;re being frank about the fact that we&rsquo;re not prepared to give up the security of our country&rsquo;s energy supply.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EU promised to do away with Russian fossil fuels by 2030 but stopped short of an immediate ban on oil and gas, defying calls from Kiev to do so.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Monday that Brussels may exempt Hungary and neighboring Slovakia from an embargo on Russian oil, which could be included in the latest batch of sanctions.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>

                            <p><strong>Leaked Supreme Court draft decision has sent shockwaves across the country</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Abortion rights in the US could become severely curtailed, a Supreme Court document leaked to Politico has&nbsp;revealed, sending shockwaves around the country.</p>
<p>According to a draft decision <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in full by Politico on Monday evening, the highest legal authority&nbsp;in the US has voted to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion.</p>
<p>The 1973 ruling provided women with the absolute right to a termination in the first trimester of pregnancy and limited rights in the second. A 1992 ruling &ndash; Planned Parenthood v. Casey &ndash; upheld the judgement.</p>
<p>Now a majority of the Supreme Court appears to be leaning towards overturning both decisions and handing back&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>the issue of abortion to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,</em>&rdquo; Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a draft majority opinion.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has set its sights on Roe v. Wade because it is related to a case the judges heard late last year. According to a Politico source &ldquo;<em>familiar with the court&rsquo;s deliberations</em>,&rdquo; five Republican-appointed justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and three Democratic-appointed judges are working on the dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>How Chief Justice John Roberts will ultimately vote, and whether he will join an already written opinion or draft his own, is unclear,</em>&rdquo; the outlet writes.</p>
<p>Overturning Roe v. Wade will immediately allow 22 states where all the necessary judicial preparations have already been made, to outlaw abortion after a few weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>However, in the past, judges have often changed their votes in the process of deliberation. The court is expected to publish its final decision in late June or early July.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the 98-page leaked document is only a first draft decision, the unprecedented insight into the deliberations of the judges has had a bombshell effect among both anti-abortion activists and abortion rights supporters, who took to Washington, DC within hours of publication.<br /><br />&ldquo;<em>While abortion is still legal, tonight&rsquo;s report makes clear that our deepest fears are coming true. We have reached a crisis moment for abortion access. We don&rsquo;t have a moment to spare &ndash; we must act now</em>,&rdquo; non-profit organization Planned Parenthood tweeted.</p>

<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton blasted the supposed decision of the Supreme Court as an &ldquo;<em>utter disgrace</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>a direct assault on the dignity, rights, &amp; lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law.</em>&rdquo;</p>

                            <p><strong>The West African nation’s government cited “flagrant violations” of its sovereignty by the former colonial ruler</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Malian authorities declared on Monday that the country is pulling out of previously signed defense accords with France, citing &ldquo;<em>flagrant violations</em>&rdquo; of its sovereignty by French forces deployed in&nbsp;the country</p>
<p>The military government in Bamako had repeatedly warned Paris that it could end military cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>In a televised address on Monday, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga explained the move by saying: &ldquo;F<em>or some time now, the government of the Republic of Mali notes with regret a profound deterioration in military cooperation with France.</em>&rdquo; Among other things, Maiga mentioned France&rsquo;s decision to end joint operations with the Malian military last June, as well as Macron&rsquo;s announcement in February that Paris was withdrawing its troops.</p>
<p>He went on to cite several cases of what he described as violations of Mali&rsquo;s sovereignty by French forces.</p>
<p>In April, Bamako claimed that French drones had violated Mali&rsquo;s airspace to spy on its military dozens of times since the start of the year.</p>

<p>While officials said they had notified Paris of their decision on Monday afternoon, there has been no official reaction from the French government yet.</p>
<p>Relations between France and Mali have steadily deteriorated since the military government came to power in the West African country in August 2020.</p>
<p>France, which ruled Mali from the late 19th century until 1960, has accused the new government of creating &ldquo;<em>multiple obstructions</em>&rdquo; that effectively prevented the continuation of a joint counter-terrorism operation in the country involving the French contingent.</p>
<p>The agreements, now officially nixed by the Malian government, date back to 2013-14. Paris launched Operation Serval in Mali in 2013. A year later it was replaced by the larger Operation Barkhane, aimed at tackling insurgency in the whole of the Sahel region, which &ndash; besides Mali &ndash; spans Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mauritania.</p>
<p>Announcing the troop withdrawal in mid-February, President Emmanuel Macron said that &ldquo;<em>victory against terror is not possible if it&rsquo;s not supported by the state itself,</em>&rdquo; suggesting that officials in Bamako were no longer interested in fighting Islamists. The French leader also stressed that he did not see the pullout as an admission of failure on the part of Paris.</p>
<p>In 2021, Mali invited a private Russian paramilitary organization to assist in fighting the terrorists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Six days later, Homeland Security rolls out the &lsquo;Ministry of Truth&rsquo; (aka Disinformation Governance Board),&rdquo;</em> Gabbard said, later <a href="https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1521070135041159168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling</a> on Democrats to oppose the <em>&ldquo;propaganda board.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden is just a front man. Obama, April 21: social media censors “don’t go far enough,” so the government needs to step in to do the job.

<p>In the speech in question, delivered at Stanford University, Obama argued that while social media platforms have taken efforts against <em>&ldquo;dangerous content&rdquo;</em> that <em>&ldquo;should be applauded,&rdquo;</em> decisions about moderation <em>&ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t be left solely to private interests.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;These decisions affect all of us, and just like every other industry that has a big impact in our society, that means these big platforms need to be subject to some level of public oversight and regulation,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Obama has stepped up warnings about online disinformation in recent weeks, giving a number of <a href="https://twitter.com/ObamaFoundation/status/1511731600320573447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speeches</a> on the issue this month alone, in addition to a <a href="https://twitter.com/ObamaFoundation/status/1516161557956333570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conference</a> organized by the Obama Foundation to discuss <em>&ldquo;creative solutions&rdquo;</em> to the problem.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The Biden administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-immigration-media-europe-misinformation-4e873389889bb1d9e2ad8659d9975e9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the new Disinformation Governance Board last week, noting it will operate under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Though officials have stated the board will <em>&ldquo;monitor&rdquo;</em> supposed <em>&ldquo;disinformation&rdquo;</em> online in a <em>&ldquo;nonpartisan&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;apolitical&rdquo;</em> manner, the full scope of its activities remains unclear, despite later clarifications from DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Pressed on exactly how the board will operate during a sit-down with CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash on Sunday, Mayorkas would only say that it would not violate the rights of Americans or spy on citizens.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;It works to ensure that the way in which we address threats &ndash; the connectivity between threats and acts of violence, are addressed without infringing on free speech, protecting civil rights and civil liberties, the right of privacy,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;The board, this working group, will draw from best practices and communicate those best practices to the operators.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Critics were quick to denounce the new disinformation board as akin to the thought-policing Ministry of Truth from George Orwell&rsquo;s &lsquo;1984&rsquo;, with Gabbard previously <a href="https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1520003460787163136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dubbing</a> it a state <em>&ldquo;propaganda arm.&rdquo;</em> The White House has rejected that characterization, however, insisting the board was not created to <em>&ldquo;adjudicate what is true or false, online or otherwise.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Ecology Minister Roberto Cingolani’s comments come as 10 EU countries are reportedly prepared to buy gas in Russian currency</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Italian Minister of Ecological Transition Roberto Cingolani told Politico on Monday that Italian companies should <em>&ldquo;go ahead and pay in rubles&rdquo;</em> for Russian gas, as Moscow has demanded. Although his ministry later said that it does not back such a move, 10 EU nations are reportedly planning to do the same.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I think it would be good for a few months, at least, to allow companies to go ahead and pay in rubles, while we understand the legal framework and implications,&rdquo;</em> Cingolani <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-eu-energy-pay-russia-gas-rubles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, adding that he wants <em>&ldquo;a speedy and very clear pronouncement from the European Commission&rdquo;</em> on whether such an arrangement would breach EU sanctions.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Shortly afterwards, Cingolani&rsquo;s ministry issued a statement saying that the minister <em>&ldquo;has never been open to a payment in rubles.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>However, Italy depends on Russia for around 40% of its gas imports, and Cingolani said that while oil and gas companies <em>&ldquo;cannot risk&rdquo;</em> paying and breaking sanctions, they also <em>&ldquo;cannot risk &hellip; not paying&rdquo;</em> until recently-signed gas contracts with African countries come into effect.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded in March that <em>&ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo;</em> countries &ndash; those that back sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia&rsquo;s military offensive in Ukraine &ndash; would have to pay for gas in Russia&rsquo;s national currency. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off after they refused this demand.</p>

<p><strong></strong>However, Hungary has opened a euro account with Russia&rsquo;s Gazprombank for purchasing Russian gas. These euro payments are then converted into rubles by the bank, and transferred to gas suppliers in Russia, fulfilling the contract. Hungarian government official Gergely Gulyas told the public radio on Sunday that nine other EU countries were preparing the same payment scheme and not announcing it publicly.</p>
<p><strong></strong>A report by Bloomberg last week claimed that four EU states have already paid for gas by this mechanism.</p>
<p><strong></strong>It is unclear whether this setup breaches EU sanctions on Russia, as European buyers are technically not sending rubles to Russia. Cingolani said that EU companies could regard the transfer of euros to Gazprombank as the <em>&ldquo;final transaction,&rdquo;</em> while Russian suppliers would consider the deal done upon receipt of rubles.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;In this process there are gray areas, which could constitute a breach of sanctions. However you do it, there is a problem,&rdquo;</em> he stated.</p>
<p><strong></strong>EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Politico that the commission would <em>&ldquo;issue more detailed guidance on what companies can and cannot do within our sanctions framework&rdquo;</em> soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US tech giant has been barring third-party app developers from accessing contactless payment technologies, the EU argues</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The EU Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Apple on Monday over the US tech giant&rsquo;s supposedly abusive practices in the field of mobile wallets technology. The company has been using its <em>&ldquo;dominant position&rdquo;</em> in the market to bar third-party services from accessing software and hardware on its devices facilitating contactless payments, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a> states.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple&rsquo;s devices,&rdquo;</em> the EU Commission&rsquo;s competition policy head, Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, said, adding that the EU had preliminary data suggesting the US company might have restricted competition to benefit Apple Pay.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If confirmed, such a conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,&rdquo;</em> Vestager warned.</p>

<p>The hardware and software in question, jointly known as the near-field communication technology or NFC, allows interaction with payment terminals in stores and helps people make purchases with a quick tap. According to the European regulators, Apple bars PayPal and other similar services from accessing it on iPhones and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple will now have the opportunity to respond or challenge this assessment before the final judgment is announced. If it fails to reach a settlement with the EU, it can be fined up to 10% of its global revenue, which might equal $36 billion.</p>
<p>So far, the company has denied any wrongdoing. <em>&ldquo;Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,&rdquo;</em> it said in a Monday statement, adding that it would continue to work with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>The EU, in turn, has said that the Statement of Objections <em>&ldquo;does not prejudge the outcome of an investigation.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This is not the first time the US tech giant has faced antitrust accusations in the EU. Last year, the bloc brought similar charges against the company following a complaint by Spotify and some other services about the 30% commission Apple imposes on any purchases made inside the apps allowed on its devices. The case is still pending.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Italy fined Apple and Amazon some $230 million over what it called anti-competitive cooperation in sales on Amazon&rsquo;s Italian platform. The two tech giants struck a deal back in 2018 allowing certain resellers to sell Apple products and Beats electronic accessories on Amazon, thus affecting completion and prices, according to the national antitrust authority.</p>
<p>In June 2021, Germany&rsquo;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO) launched a probe into the Apple Store&rsquo;s operations, arguing it <em>&ldquo;empowers Apple to influence the operations of third parties.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Despite their warm fuzzy packaging and seemingly altruistic intentions, mental health and prayer apps are &ldquo;<em>worse than any other product</em>&rdquo; when it comes to user privacy and security, an analysis by browser firm Mozilla revealed on Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The vast majority of mental health and prayer apps are exceptionally creepy</em>,&rdquo; Mozilla&rsquo;s Jen Caltrider, the primary creator of the firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Privacy not Included</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/mental-health-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a>, which evaluated 32 such apps on their respect for users&rsquo; personal data, told the Verge on Monday. Caltrider noted that the apps one might think would recognize the sensitive nature of their data instead &ldquo;<em>track, share, and capitalize on users&rsquo; most intimate personal thoughts and feelings, like moods, mental state, and biometric data.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps slurping up biometric data and other seemingly private information are nothing new, but given the assumption of privacy that comes with the real-life relationship between a therapist and patient, or a believer and religious institution, one might hope that app developers would at least attempt to replicate such safe spaces when taking the whole process online.</p>
<p>However, the Privacy not Included guide found that out of 32 such apps, fully 29 received a privacy warning label, noting that they either stored large amounts of personal data under vague privacy policies or otherwise maintained poor security practices, such as weak passwords. One popular app, Talkspace, stashes entire chat transcripts between user and therapist. Another, an AI therapy chatbot called Woebot, actually collects information about users from third parties, then shares it for advertising purposes, all while pretending to be their silicon shoulder to cry on.</p>

<p>Mozillla researcher Misha Rykov referred to the apps his team analyzed as &ldquo;<em>data-sucking machines with a mental health app veneer</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</em>.&rdquo; But with real-life therapy increasingly expensive and the process of finding a therapist who 'matches' a patient hit or miss, the lure of a friendly voice just a click away is difficult to resist for some. But given the apps&rsquo; apparent core purpose of data mining and selling users&rsquo; deepest darkest secrets, it might be a better idea to hold one&rsquo;s tongue until one can meet up with a qualified therapist or at least a trusted friend &ndash; ideally in real life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hundreds of French police union members turned out for protests on Monday after one of their number was arrested over the shooting to death of two people in a car on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris on April 24.</p>
<p>That was the same day that Emmanuel Macron defeated Marine Le Pen in the country's presidential election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three police unions, Alliance, Synergie, and Unsa-Police, declared the decision to arrest their colleague &ldquo;<em>inadmissible</em>&rdquo; and pledged to take to the streets to air their grievances across 40 cities, primarily at law enforcement buildings and near courts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the largest gathering was set to take place on the Place Saint-Michel, close to the location of the shooting on the Pont-Neuf. Seemingly concerned that the government cannot be relied upon to back actions taken in the line of duty, the police are demanding the establishment of a &ldquo;<em>presumption of self-defense.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the fateful evening, the officer in question fired his rifle at the car on the bridge in central Paris when it failed to stop for a checkpoint. Two occupants of the car died at the scene and a third was injured. The officer claimed to have discharged his weapon in self-defense. Local media coverage has not mentioned whether any of the occupants of the car were armed or otherwise posed a threat to the officer, and details around the case remain uncertain.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old was immediately taken in for questioning by the internal investigation agency. Prosecutors have suggested that it was likely he used excessive force. The police report confirmed the number of shots fired, with five or six bullets hitting the victims out of the 12 or so rounds fired, according to the news agency AFP. He has been charged with &ldquo;<em>deliberate homicide</em>&rdquo; of the driver of the vehicle, &ldquo;<em>deliberate violence by a person holding public authority resulting in death without intention of giving it</em>&rdquo; regarding the front-seat passenger, who was also killed, and &ldquo;<em>violence voluntarily aggregated by a person holding public authority</em>&rdquo; with regard to the back-seat passenger, who was injured but survived.</p>

<p>Not long after the cops took to the streets, counter-protesters joined the fray in some locations, denouncing police violence and accusing the officers of being murderers. Tensions between the authorities and the population have run high for years in France. Weeks of Yellow Vest protests gave way to demonstrations against Covid-19 restrictions and now anti-Macron election protests. Dozens were arrested on Sunday as well at May Day protests and demonstrations against Macron&rsquo;s reelection.<em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The network has flagged 11 articles that contained plagiarized information</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>NBC News apologized to its readers on Monday for eleven articles over the past year that contained plagiarized passages. The network did not retract the stories, however, but removed the problematic paragraphs and added editors&rsquo; notes to them. The Comcast-owned network also didn't name the reporter at fault. Other outlets were not so circumspect, however.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The eleven articles <em>&ldquo;contained passages from other news organizations that were used without attribution,&rdquo;</em> NBC said in a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/note-readers-rcna26934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. <em>&ldquo;In all cases, the passages were not central to the stories, but instead contained supplemental or background material that did not represent original reporting.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;An editor&rsquo;s note has been placed on each of the articles, and the passages that were plagiarized have been removed,&rdquo;</em> NBC added, without naming the reporter or revealing their fate with the company.</p>
<p><strong></strong>CNN&rsquo;s Oliver Darcy soon did both, however. <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that NBC discovered this during a routine editing process and launched a review where other instances were discovered,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1521192240831475712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. <em>&ldquo;The reporter, Teaganne Finn, is no longer with the network.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Finn previously worked at Bloomberg News as a breaking news reporter, and was hired by NBC to cover US politics in June 2021. Prior to her work at Bloomberg, she had interned on the investigations team of the Washington Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The US has delivered 80% of the howitzers it promised Kiev, Washington claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Some 80% of the M777 howitzers and half of the 155mm ammunition for them &ndash; promised to Ukraine by US President Joe Biden last month &ndash; have already been delivered, the Department of Defense said on Monday.</p>
<p>The US military also said it has supplied&nbsp;nearly all the counter-battery and anti-aircraft radars and 5,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles pledged, but no helicopters just yet.</p>
<p>The figures came from a background briefing at the Pentagon on Monday, where an unnamed American defense official gave reporters the official account of Washington&rsquo;s military aid to Kiev.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Biden <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553837-pentagon-weapons-list-ukraine/">initially promised</a> Ukraine 18 howitzers, but later added another 72, along with 140,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition, ten counter-artillery radars, two air surveillance radars, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers, 100 humvees and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the Pentagon, half of the 155mm ammunition is already in Ukrainian hands, and more is headed over every day. A total of 72 howitzers have been delivered, along with &ldquo;nearly all&rdquo; the radars. A total of 14 cargo flights departed the US over the past 24 hours, and 11 more are expected over the next day, along with 23 flights from five other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>These supply flights reportedly land in Poland, from where the weapons are taken across the Ukrainian border by road and rail.</p>

<p>The Pentagon also revealed that the training of Ukrainian troops on the new howitzers is taking place in Germany. Florida National Guard troops based there, which had previously deployed to Ukraine for training, have taken over the howitzer drills from original Canadian instructors. More than 170 Ukrainian troops have already been trained in handling the M777s, and another 50 are completing their training, the official said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>A group of 20 Ukrainians have started a week-long training course in using the Phoenix Ghost tactical drones, the official added. However, the Mi-17 helicopters have yet to be delivered to Kiev.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Another detail disclosed by the Pentagon is that Ukraine has so far received 5,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles. The US military has been raiding its own stockpiles for both the Javelins and the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as their manufacturer, Raytheon, <a href="http://v">complained last week</a> the components to make more were in short supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Since February 24, the US has pledged nearly $15 billion in military aid to Kiev, more than double Ukraine&rsquo;s entire military budget for 2021. Last week, Congress <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554628-congress-lend-lease-ukraine/">approved a bill</a> that would enable the White House to send nearly unlimited quantities and types of weapons and ammunition using a WWII-era <em>&ldquo;lend-lease&rdquo;</em> mechanism.</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian armed forces have lost 1,246 artillery weapons, not counting multiple rocket launcher systems, since the start of the hostilities. Russia has also repeatedly targeted warehouses storing equipment sent from the West.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Surging inflation in the UK appears to be behind the growth of casket-renting services</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Cash-strapped Brits are renting temporary coffins for funeral services before having their loved ones buried in cardboard, the Sun reported on Monday. Funeral directors say the cost-saving measure is becoming more popular as Brits struggle with a skyrocketing cost of living.</p>
<p>A temporary coffin is obtained for the day of the funeral and is returned afterward. The deceased is placed into a cheap and lightweight &lsquo;inner&rsquo; coffin, which sits inside the rented casket. This outer coffin is then removed after the service, leaving the body to be interred inside the lighter one.</p>
<p>The average cost of renting a coffin is &pound;250 ($312), the Sun <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18427252/cost-of-living-crisis-rent-coffins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>, much below the &pound;750 ($937) price tag for buying a casket outright.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are many ways to keep the cost of a funeral within a budget, while making it special,&rdquo;</em> a spokesman for the National Association of Funeral Directors told the British tabloid. <em>"Provided it is clear what is being provided, this is one of several choices available that may assist families.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While one manufacturer of rental coffins told the Sun that her company&rsquo;s products should be seen as no different from renting a wedding dress, an <em>&ldquo;industry insider&rdquo;</em> told the tabloid that <em>&ldquo;this move is the latest sign the living costs crisis is literally becoming a killer issue.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>"This rental coffin market is saving families thousands of pounds, but it&rsquo;s sad they must come to terms with the fact their loved one isn&rsquo;t in an enclosed casket,&rdquo;</em> the source said.</p>
<p>Inflation in the UK <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/march2022#:~:text=contribution%20from%20food.-,The%20Consumer%20Prices%20Index%20(CPI)%20rose%20by%207.0%25%20in,when%20it%20stood%20at%207.1%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rose</a> by 7% in the year leading up to March. This 12-month rate is the highest since March 1992. Energy costs have <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9428/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soared</a> even higher in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine and Britain&rsquo;s decision to cut itself off from Russian energy imports, as households are now paying 28% more for gas and 19% more for electricity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 83% of adults in the UK <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/articles/impactofincreasedcostoflivingonadultsacrossgreatbritain/november2021tomarch2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> an increase in their cost of living in March.&nbsp; Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility <a href="https://obr.uk/box/developments-in-the-outlook-for-household-living-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> that real household incomes would fall by 2.2% this year, and that Britons would experience the largest fall in living standards since records began in 1956.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Companies are supplying intelligence to NATO, Kiev, and the media, the Wall Street Journal reported</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A host of private companies have deployed spy satellites over Ukraine to track the movement of Russian forces from space, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Some sell this data to Western governments and media outlets, while others send it directly to the government in Kiev. With the line between observation and participation blurred, many of the firms are keeping their work quiet.</p>
<p>When outlets such as the Journal publish aerial photos from Ukraine, they&rsquo;re not relying on spy satellites operated by the US and its allies. Instead they&rsquo;re paying private firms to do this surveillance work, with the newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-puts-spy-satellites-for-hire-in-the-spotlight-11651410002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> that it buys imagery directly from Maxar Technologies.</p>
<p>Maxar&rsquo;s satellites, the report&nbsp;stated, can take photographs from space with a resolution down to 12 inches. However, such companies are not just deploying their satellites to help the Western media land scoops but are also supplying military intelligence to Ukraine and NATO allies, which is then being used by Kiev to target Russian forces.</p>

<p>According to the report, Planet Labs PBC and HawkEye 360 are tracking Russian troop movements, with the former relaying this information to the Pentagon. MDA, a space technology company, says it&rsquo;s working with other companies to supply imagery to the Ukrainian government, while BlackSky Technology, which tracks radio signals, is reportedly supplying data to unnamed <em>&ldquo;customers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Although less sophisticated than the kind of satellites operated by state-level actors, some of these privately-operated eyes in the sky can see through clouds and function at night.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has not commented on the extent of its use of <em>&ldquo;commercial satellite imagery services,&rdquo;</em> but these services were funded as part of a package of military aid to Ukraine announced last month. Moreover, the US has openly admitted to sharing military intelligence with Ukraine, and reportedly <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554643-us-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded</a> the scope of this sharing last month.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that <em>&ldquo;many companies declined to be specific about how they are assisting Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> fearing that they could be seen as direct participants in the conflict. Even the White House previously held back on sharing <em>&ldquo;actionable information&rdquo;</em> with Kiev,<em> &ldquo;because that steps over the line to making us participating in the war,&rdquo;</em> Congressman Adam Smith (D-Washington), who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some companies are open about their support for Ukraine. Satellogic, an Argentinian firm feeding data to Kiev, described its role as <em>&ldquo;helping the cause,&rdquo;</em> and has partnered with the Halifax International Security Forum to fundraise for more satellite surveillance for Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian government has not commented on Ukraine and the West&rsquo;s use of private spy satellites in Ukraine. However, the Kremlin has taken a dim view of Western arms shipments to Ukraine, calling them <em>&ldquo;legitimate targets&rdquo;</em> and destroying several warehouses of them with missile strikes.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described the West&rsquo;s response to its operation in Ukraine as NATO <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy,&rdquo;</em> while President Vladimir Putin has warned that any outside interference in the conflict that puts Russia&rsquo;s security at risk would be met with a <em>&ldquo;swift, lightning-fast&rdquo;</em> response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Disputed island is looking to emulate Kiev if it squares off with Beijing, the foreign minister says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwan has observed the conflict in Ukraine and drawn several lessons for its own confrontation with mainland China, the disputed island&rsquo;s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told CNN in an interview aired on Sunday.</p>
<p>Wu argued that Beijing is hesitant to move on the island due to what he described as Russia&rsquo;s lack of progress in Ukraine and the international community&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>Taiwan is <em>&ldquo;watching this very carefully,&rdquo;</em> Wu&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2022/05/01/exp-gps-0501-wu-on-what-taiwans-learned-from-ukraine.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told CNN&rsquo;</a>s Fareed Zakaria. <em>&ldquo;We try to see what we can learn from Ukraine in defending ourselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Wu described Ukraine as being <em>&ldquo;on the frontline against Russia&rsquo;s outward expansion,&rdquo;</em> and accused Russia of using the military <em>&ldquo;for its historical glory,&rdquo;</em> in what he said was a parallel to the China-Taiwan situation.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s two big takeaways from the conflict are that Ukraine is using <em>&ldquo;small personal weapons to go against a large enemy,&rdquo;</em> and that its male population is highly motivated. <em>&ldquo;They want to serve in the military. They want to go to the war zones to fight against Russia. That kind of spirit is enviable for the Taiwanese people,&rdquo;</em> Wu said.</p>
<p>Wu&rsquo;s emphasis on <em>&ldquo;asymmetric capability,&rdquo;</em> such as Javelin and NLAW anti-tank rockets &ndash; widely promoted as wonder-weapons in Ukraine &ndash; is consistent with President Tsai Ing-wen&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s focus on such armaments. Tsai also hopes Washington would come to Taiwan&rsquo;s aid directly, she told CNN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/538658-taiwan-us-defend-china/">in October</a>.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a war, we need friends and allies to support Taiwan, as in the case of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Wu told Zakaria, pointing to how the US, EU, and Japan came together to support Kiev.</p>
<p>Though the US has not sent troops to Ukraine, Washington is pouring money and weapons into the country <em>&ldquo;to fight against Russia,&rdquo;</em> Wu noted. <em>&ldquo;I think the Chinese government must be thinking or calculating how the US or other major countries are going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help or whether they&rsquo;re going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help. If Taiwan does not have any support, I think that&rsquo;s going to be a green light to aggression.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554646-liz-truss-nato-ukraine-taiwan/">a speech</a> last week that <em>&ldquo;a Global NATO&rdquo;</em> needs to arm Taiwan just as it has armed Ukraine, among other things. The day before CNN aired the interview with Wu, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0991186-d511-45c2-b5f0-9bd5b8ceee40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a> reported that the White House officials in charge of China and the Indo-Pacific have met with British colleagues to explore contingency plans about Taiwan.</p>
<p>Wu also argued that Ukraine&rsquo;s ability to hold off Russia &ndash; which he attributed to <em>&ldquo;the desire to defend the country and the willingness to use personal weapons&rdquo;</em> &ndash; is giving Beijing reason to worry.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If they are not able to take Taiwan over quickly, I think they need to pause and think twice before they act,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Beijing considers Taiwan part of China&rsquo;s sovereign territory. Since 1949, the island has been ruled by the remnants of the nationalist government, which fled the mainland after defeat in the civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Both US parties are losing faith in their leaders’ ability to right the economic ship</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Fewer than half of US adults have &ldquo;<em>a great deal</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>a fair amount</em>&rdquo; of confidence in the abilities of Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, US President Joe Biden, or either party&rsquo;s congressional leaders to do &ldquo;<em>the right thing</em>&rdquo; for the economy, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392306/confidence-economic-leaders-flagging.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted by Gallup during the first three weeks of April and published on Monday.</p>
<p>Equally troublingly, nearly half have &ldquo;<em>almost no</em>&rdquo; confidence in these figures, who have repeatedly dangled rosy predictions of economic recovery in the face of a gross domestic product that actually declined for the first quarter of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powell leads the pack, with 43% of respondents expressing confidence in his abilities, while Biden trails at 40%, tied with Republican leaders in Congress and two points ahead of their Democratic counterparts (38%). Those numbers have fallen precipitously over the past year as the inflation rate has more than doubled to its highest rate in over four decades. Despite reassuring words from their leaders, more and more Americans are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392162/personal-finance-ratings-slide-amid-rising-prices.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggling</a> to make ends meet, with many <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392159/inflation-concerns-fueling-low-economic-confidence.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerned</a> there is no end in sight to the nation&rsquo;s fiscal predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As leaders&rsquo; favorable ratings have shrunk, negative public opinion has surged, with fully 43% of respondents &ndash; irrespective of party lines &ndash; claiming they had almost no confidence in Biden to do the right thing for the economy. Powell fared slightly better &ndash; possibly due to lack of name recognition &ndash; with 10% of respondents expressing no opinion about him, although 22% said they had no faith in his abilities either. Democrats in Congress inspired similar revulsion from 42% of respondents, while Republicans got away with 30% expressing almost no confidence in their abilities.</p>

<p>When broken down along party lines, both parties saw their approval ratings inflate significantly. A whopping 80% of Democrats expressed confidence in Biden, and 77% in their party&rsquo;s congressional leaders. Even 61% expressed confidence in Powell, a Trump appointee who has continued to lead the Fed under Biden. Republicans were much less charitable, with just 8% expressing confidence in Biden, but 66% supported their party&rsquo;s leaders in Congress. Just 31% of the party had confidence in Powell, who has struggled to control inflation after initially denying it was a major issue.</p>
<p>Independents, who make up a growing percentage of the American political body, expressed low confidence in both parties, with just 36% believing in Biden to do the right thing economically and 38% expressing faith in Powell. About a third support the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress (32% and 34%, respectively).</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s approval rating has fallen by 17 points over the last year, according to the pollster, while Powell&rsquo;s has dropped 12 points and Democratic members of Congress have lost 11 points. Republicans fared comparatively well, gaining one point in confidence, though the previous year&rsquo;s results had placed them at the bottom of the heap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s current rating places him below even his predecessor Donald Trump, whose confidence rating dipped to 42% before reversing course in 2018. Powell, who had previously outperformed his predecessors in terms of public approval, has dipped to the levels occupied by the previous Fed chair and current Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>With few publicly stated plans to improve the nation&rsquo;s economic outlook beyond increasing interest rates &ndash; which may cause more short-term suffering before reining in the inflation it&rsquo;s designed to target &ndash; the feelings of Americans about their government are likely to continue declining before they improve, Gallup found.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Defense Minister Margarita Robles had their mobile phones targeted with Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, Minister of the Presidency Felix Bolanos said on Monday. It is unknown who deployed the malware, but Catalan independence leaders have also accused the Spanish government of using it against them.</p>
<p>Bolanos told a press conference that Sanchez&rsquo; phone had been infected in May 2021, and that at least one data leak had occurred, Reuters reported.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The interventions were illicit and external. External means carried out by non-official bodies and without state authorization,&rdquo;</em> he said, without disclosing whether foreign or Spanish groups are thought to have been behind the operation.</p>

<p>Pegasus is a sophisticated hacking tool developed by an Israeli firm, NSO Group, and sold to state-level clients around the world. Its widespread activity was revealed last summer by Amnesty International and more than a dozen media organizations, and those targeted by the spyware include top political leaders like British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554119-pegasus-spying-europe-catalonia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boris Johnson</a>, who a recent report claims was targeted for surveillance by hackers based in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Around 50,000 phones worldwide have been illegally accessed using the malware, with targets including journalists, activists, businesspeople and political figures. The Israeli software grants the hacker the ability to read messages, look through photos, track the person&rsquo;s location, and even switch on the camera without the knowledge of the phone&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p>In Spain, more than 60 phones linked to Catalan independence activists were reportedly breached between 2015 and 2020, with those targeted including members of the European Parliament, Catalan presidents, legislators, jurists, and members of civil society organizations, according to a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/catalangate-extensive-mercenary-spyware-operation-against-catalans-using-pegasus-candiru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> last month by cyber research firm Citizen Lab.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Every Catalan Member of the European Parliament (MEP) that supported independence was targeted either directly with Pegasus, or via suspected relational targeting,&rdquo;</em> Citizen Lab said. <em>&ldquo;Three MEPs were directly infected, two more had staff, family members, or close associates targeted with Pegasus.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While the culprits remain unknown, Catalan politicians have blamed the Spanish government. Previous <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/2020-07-15/los-servicios-de-informacion-tienen-programas-como-el-que-espio-a-torrent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> in local media accused Spain&rsquo;s National Intelligence Center of using Pegasus to snoop on the separatists since 2015, under the governments of Sanchez and his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy.</p>
<p>Sanchez&rsquo; government has not taken responsibility for spying on the Catalonians, and said that it would investigate the allegations. NSO Group denied the claims unequivocally, telling the New Yorker <em>&ldquo;These allegations are, yet again, false,&rdquo;</em> having previously rebutted similar accusations. Despite a litany of other spying claims in the past, the company has insisted its products are used exclusively for legal law enforcement purposes only.</p>

                            <p><strong>Finnish President Sauli Niinisto will reportedly voice his support for accession into the Western military alliance on May 12</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finland will announce its intention to join NATO on May 12, in a bid to speed up the process of applying to the military bloc, Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Monday, citing multiple sources.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, President Sauli Niinisto will announce his support for joining the alliance in the morning. Later that day, his announcement will be followed &ldquo;<em>in the spirit of parliamentarism</em>&rdquo; by the parliamentary groups giving their approval as well.</p>
<p>The date of May 12 was chosen because the various parliamentary committees were already planning to discuss foreign and security matters on that day. Prime Minister Sanna Marin has also approved the date for the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The position is that Finland is applying for membership,</em>&rdquo; Iltalehti said.</p>
<p>The text of the decision, which apparently has already been prepared, will then be approved by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign and Security Policy, submitted to the parliament, and passed on to NATO for consideration.</p>
<p>These arrangements, the newspaper said, will speed up the process, avoid a parliamentary vote, and take the application to NATO &ldquo;<em>at high speed</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finland, which shares a border with Russia, and Sweden, both being EU members, have so far opted to remain outside of NATO and maintain neutral status.</p>

<p>Recent polls in both countries, however, reveal that the Russian military offensive in Ukraine has shifted public opinion, with more respondents now supporting the idea of membership in NATO than in recent years. The changes prompted Stockholm and Helsinki to reconsider their non-alignment policies.</p>
<p>Earlier media reports suggest that Sweden and Finland were planning to simultaneously submit membership applications to NATO in mid-May. The Swedish parliament is now conducting an overview of its security policy.</p>
<p>In early April, the alliance&rsquo;s head, Jens Stoltenberg, said NATO &ldquo;<em>will warmly welcome</em>&rdquo; Finland and Sweden if they apply to join, and is prepared to make a decision on membership &ldquo;<em>quite quickly</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, who previously expressed concerns over potential retaliation from Russia, said recently that the NATO countries have been &ldquo;<em>very actively</em>&rdquo; offering Helsinki &ldquo;<em>both diplomatic and security assistance</em>&rdquo; for the period of the application process.</p>
<p>Russia considers the further expansion of NATO to be a direct threat to its own national security, and &ldquo;<em>for the whole architecture of security.</em>&rdquo; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned in April that Moscow would &ldquo;<em>take additional measures</em>&rdquo; to make its defenses on the Western flank &ldquo;<em>more sophisticated</em>&rdquo; if Finland and Sweden join the bloc.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following its failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>More than 3 million refugees have been taken in by Poland, UN data shows</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>More than 5.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia&rsquo;s military attack on the country began in February, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The data is compiled using a variety of sources, including numbers provided by the authorities at official border crossing points, the agency said.</p>
<p>According to the UN, Poland has taken over 3 million people from Ukraine. Romania has been the second largest recipient of Ukrainian refugees, taking in over 800,000, the data show. Meanwhile, almost 700,000 people have fled to Russia, while more than half a million have been accommodated by Hungary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UNHCR said last week that a further 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. According to the agency, 13 million people overall are estimated to be stranded in affected areas of the country, unable to leave due to<em> &ldquo;heightened security risks,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;destruction of bridges and roads,&rdquo;</em> and a lack of information on where to find safety and accommodation.</p>

                            <p><strong>The move would give Greg Abbott broader state powers to tackle the flow of migrants at the US border</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott is weighing a plan to invoke real war powers by declaring an<em> &ldquo;invasion&rdquo;</em> at the US southern border to get around a clause in the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Abbott could declare an invasion to comply with a clause in the US Constitution which prohibits states from engaging in war unless they were <em>&ldquo;actually invaded.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lawyers for Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton met earlier this month to debate the plan, which would directly challenge the federal government, the New York Times reported. It would allow Texas state police to arrest and deport migrants, two people familiar with the discussion told the paper.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we do use this strategy, it could expose law enforcement in the state of Texas to being prosecuted,&rdquo;</em> Abbott said during a press conference last week, confirming that he was<em> &ldquo;looking into&rdquo;</em> the idea.</p>

<p>Abbott has already mobilized thousands of National Guard troops and previously ordered checks of trucks arriving from Mexico. He backtracked on the vehicle inspections after truckers blockaded border bridges in protests, disrupting food supplies and threatening more economic losses.</p>
<p>The governor has also ramped up funding for law enforcement in border towns, directing more than $3 billion to border security overall. He has also overseen the construction of miles of new fencing.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called Abbott&rsquo;s actions a <em>&ldquo;publicity stunt&rdquo;</em> last month.</p>
<p>Texas recorded almost 129,000 migrant crossings into Texas in March, roughly 11,000 more than during the same month last year. Officials expect the numbers to rise again when the Biden administration ends the pandemic policy of turning some people away at the border under the Title 42 public health rule.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the administration&rsquo;s handling of the border issue last week, telling Congress that it inherited<em> &ldquo;a broken and dismantled system&rdquo;</em> from the Trump administration, but had <em>&ldquo;effectively managed an unprecedented number of noncitizens seeking to enter the United States.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A government spokesman said Budapest will not back a ban on Russian oil and gas</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Hungary has denied a report in the German media which claims that the country is prepared to support an EU ban on Russian oil and gas in response to Moscow&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Budapest affirmed its stance on the matter after German public broadcaster ZDF quoted sources as saying that <em>&ldquo;hesitant&rdquo;</em> countries, such as Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, have <em>&ldquo;withdrawn their veto.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Hungarian government&rsquo;s international spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, tweeted on Monday: <em>&ldquo;No, dear editors at ZDF, Hungary did not &lsquo;move away from its veto&rsquo;. In fact, Hungary&rsquo;s stance on oil and gas sanctions [from] Russia remains unchanged: We do not support them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hungary, which relies heavily on Russian energy imports, has warned that cutting off supplies from Moscow will hurt its economy.<em> &ldquo;We must not adopt sanctions with which we primarily penalize ourselves instead of those we want to sanction,&rdquo;</em> Gergely Gulyas, the prime minister&rsquo;s chief of staff, told Kossuth Radio on Sunday. He explained that his country has been experiencing higher than expected inflation, and is interested in continuing to receive <em>&ldquo;energy at the cheapest possible price.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a separate interview with HirTV, Gulyas confirmed that Budapest will never support an embargo on Russian oil and gas.</p>
<p>The EU unveiled a plan in March to do away with Russian fossil fuels by 2030, but stopped short of an immediate ban, defying calls from Kiev to do so.</p>

<p>On Monday, Reuters quoted EU officials as saying that Brussels may exempt Hungary and Slovakia from the embargo on Russian oil, which is reportedly in the works. The newest sanctions package is expected to be finalized on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After the West froze Russian state assets in response to its military campaign in Ukraine, Moscow demanded that EU members switch to paying for Russian gas in rubles. Russia cut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria last week because they declined to pay in the Russian currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the move <em>&ldquo;unjustified and unacceptable.&rdquo;</em> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov argued on Monday that the demand to pay for gas in rubles is justified because the West had <em>&ldquo;stolen&rdquo;</em> Russian assets, the <em>&ldquo;majority of which had been earned through the supplies of gas and oil.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Western leaders are aware of the damage sanctions will inflict on their own economies, Germany admits</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The year 2022 will see Western countries implementing &ldquo;<em>a very ambitious policy</em>&rdquo; of reducing dependence on energy from Russia, with Russian oil set to be phased out by the end of the year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&nbsp;has announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with Indian Express ahead of his meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin, Scholz explained that &ldquo;<em>the attack on Ukraine by Russia is on the top of the agenda for all of Europe and beyond</em>.&rdquo; He also expressed confidence that there is &ldquo;<em>broad agreement</em>&rdquo; between Germany and India that Russia&rsquo;s actions violate the &ldquo;<em>core principles of the UN Charter</em>,&rdquo; that &ldquo;<em>massacres against the civilian population are war crimes</em>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<em>those responsible must be held accountable.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to what he called a &ldquo;<em>massive and unacceptable breach of international law</em>,&rdquo; Scholz explained that many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, &ldquo;<em>even if this necessarily implies economic costs</em>&rdquo; for themselves.</p>
<p>India is among a number of major economies that have continued to trade with Moscow&nbsp;since the launch of its&nbsp;military offensive in Ukraine.&nbsp;Last month, New Delhi hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who sought to sway officials&nbsp;towards taking part in the sanctions and scaling back economic and military ties with Moscow. However, India has so far refused to condemn Russia&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We are furthermore now implementing a very ambitious policy to reduce our dependency on the import of fossil fuels from Russia. We will stop the import of Russian coal this summer, we will phase out Russian oil [by] the end of the year, and will reduce gas imports from Russia severely</em>,&rdquo; the chancellor said.</p>

<p>Scholz has been known for taking a cautious approach on the matter of Russian energy, as Germany depends on it more than many other EU countries. The chancellor has said that a ban on Russian gas would not stop the conflict in Ukraine, but would cause an economic crisis in Germany and the EU.</p>
<p>However, as the EU discusses its sixth package of sanctions against Russia, Germany has apparently begun to lean towards taking more drastic measures, possibly because it has managed to significantly cut its own dependence on direct imports of Russian oil. Energy Minister Robert Habeck revealed last week that Berlin previously sourced a third of its requirements from Russia, but has now cut that to just 12%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The problem that seemed very large for Germany only a few weeks ago has become much smaller. Germany has come very, very close to independence from Russian oil imports,</em>&rdquo; Habeck said.</p>
<p>Russia supplied about 25% of the EU&rsquo;s total annual oil needs in 2020, and the bloc accounted for half of Russia&rsquo;s exports of the fuel. Brussels reportedly intends to make up the difference by increasing imports from Nigeria, the Persian Gulf exporters, as well as Russia&rsquo;s neighboring Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Moscow is apparently skeptical about Europe&rsquo;s chances of surviving without its energy. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is currently the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554391-gas-france-russia-assessment/">wrote</a>&nbsp;last month: &ldquo;<em>According to recent IMF data, Europe will be able to do without our gas for no more than 6 months. But speaking seriously, they won&rsquo;t even last a week.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In March, the Russian deputy prime minister and former energy minister, Alexander Novak, <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/552527-moscow-warns-europe-energy-crisis/">said</a> the ban on Russian oil and gas imports could result in a crash of Europe&rsquo;s energy market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is absolutely obvious that without Russian hydrocarbons, if sanctions are imposed, the gas and oil markets will collapse. The rise in prices for energy resources can be unpredictable</em>,&rdquo; Novak said.</p>
<p>Russia sent its troops to Ukraine in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>
<p>Western countries responded to Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>aggression</em>&rdquo; by imposing harsh sanctions on various sectors of the economy. Russia considers these actions unlawful and unjustified, and has been imposing its own counter-measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Improvements are planned for critical areas, senior official discloses</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finland wants a stronger fence on its border with Russia, Colonel Marko Turunen, commander of the North Karelia Border Guard, told local media on Saturday. The news comes amid the standoff between Moscow and the West over Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Turunen explained to&nbsp;MTV3 that officials are analyzing the state of the border fence, but the final choice&nbsp;to reinforce it has not yet been made and no actual work has been done so far.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If such a decision is made, we will proceed in a controlled and planned manner,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;he outlined.</p>
<p>Russia and Finland share a 1,343km (834 mile) land border. According to MTV3, from the Finnish side, it is only protected <em>&ldquo;by a thin and rusty barbed wire fence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Turunen said a stronger barrier is planned for high-risk and critical areas, including border crossings and areas nearby. He declined to reveal the specifics on the estimated length of the planned reinforcement&nbsp;and its construction.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Krista Mikkonen told MTV3 that <em>&ldquo;Finland&rsquo;s capacity to maintain border security needs to be strengthened, and its crisis preparedness must be improved.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Riikka Purra, an MP and head of the right-wing Finns Party, backed the idea.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Construction is, of course, always expensive, but nothing is as valuable is our security,&rdquo;</em> she told the channel.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s attack on Ukraine in late February prompted discussions on whether Finland and Sweden should reconsider their longstanding policy of military nonalignment and join NATO. In a report submitted to the parliament last month, the Finnish government argued that joining the US-led bloc would <em>&ldquo;enhance the stability of the region in the long term,&rdquo;</em> but could also result in<em> &ldquo;increased tensions&rdquo;</em> along the border with Russia.</p>
<p>The Kremlin&nbsp;has repeatedly said that it sees the organisation's expansion eastward as a threat to national security. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy chairman of the country&rsquo;s Security Council, warned that Moscow will deploy additional troops on its western flank if Finland or Sweden join NATO.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

                            <p><strong>Homeland Security chief says the task force is the exact opposite of George Orwell’s infamous brainchild</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The newly unveiled &lsquo;Disinformation Governance Board&rsquo;, operating within the US Department of Homeland Security, has triggered a massive pushback, forcing DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas to make several appearances on national TV in an attempt to clarify how the unit will operate.</p>
<p>Many critics, including top Republicans, have blasted the initiative as a crackdown on free speech, akin to a &lsquo;Ministry of Truth&rsquo; taken from the pages of George Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel &lsquo;1984&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking on CNN&rsquo;s State of the Union on Sunday, Mayorkas&nbsp;dismissed the criticism by claiming that thought policing is <em>&ldquo;precisely the opposite of what this small working group within the Department of Homeland Security will do.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What it will do is gather together best practices in addressing the threat of disinformation from foreign state adversaries from the cartels and disseminate those best practices to the operators that have been executing in addressing this threat for years,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/05/01/disinformation-governance-board-alejandro-mayorkas-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, after CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash said it was still not clear <em>&ldquo;how this governance board will act.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The DHS chief also repeatedly reassured Americans that the unit has absolutely no intention, <em>&ldquo;operational authority,&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;capability&rdquo;</em> to spy on US citizens.</p>

<p>The new body is headed by Nina Jankowicz, whose resume includes working with&nbsp;the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and overseeing the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute lobby group. Detractors also scrutinized her for dismissing the New York Post&rsquo;s suppressed Hunter Biden laptop story as a fake&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Russian influence op,&rdquo;</em> only for it to be later verified by major media outlets.</p>
<p>In a separate appearance on Fox News Sunday, Mayorkas <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-better-job-disinformation-board" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defended</a> the qualifications and objectivity of Jankowicz, calling her&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;eminently qualified&rdquo;</em> and a <em>&ldquo;renowned expert in the field of disinformation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I don&rsquo;t question her objectivity. There are people in the department who have a diverse range of views and they&rsquo;re incredibly dedicated to mission. We&rsquo;re not the opinion police.</strong></em></p>

<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki also attempted to play down the &lsquo;anti-disinformation&rsquo; initiative as an alleged&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;continuation of work that began at the Department of Homeland Security in 2020, under former President Trump.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The new censorship push was announced on Wednesday, just two days after billionaire Elon Musk reached an agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion and vowed to restore freedom of speech on the platform.</p>
<p>Responding to news of Musk&rsquo;s Twitter takeover, Jankowicz said, <em>&ldquo;I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities, which are already shouldering disproportionate amounts of this abuse.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The world must arm itself against future health crises, the billionaire claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The World Health Organization is currently the only body that can create and manage a &ldquo;top-notch&rdquo; multi-domain team of health experts to detect, prevent and battle future pandemics, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said. The American billionaire is its top donor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With over 6.2 million people estimated to have died from, or with, Covid-19 over the course of the pandemic, it is possible that the world has yet to see the worst, Gates warned in an interview with the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8896c10-35da-46aa-957f-cf2b4e18cfce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> on Sunday, just days before his new book, &lsquo;How to Prevent the Next Pandemic&rsquo;, is set to hit the shelves.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still at risk of this pandemic generating a variant that would be even more transmissive and even more fatal,&rdquo;</em> Gates outlined. While saying he doesn&rsquo;t want to be&nbsp;the <em>&ldquo;voice of doom and gloom,&rdquo;</em> Gates estimated the risk that <em>&ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t even seen the worst&rdquo;</em> of the pandemic at&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;way above a 5 percent,&rdquo;</em> and emphasized the need to develop new longer-lasting vaccines.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;reiterated his call to establish a global emergency response team operating under GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization), with an annual budget of at least $1 billion. Gates said the amount of money needed for the initiative is<em> &ldquo;very small compared to the benefit,&rdquo;</em> and called it a test of world leaders&rsquo; ability to<em> &ldquo;take on new responsibilities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Last month, he gave a TED Talk in Vancouver to elaborate on the idea, also described in his book, saying he expects the group to consist of at least 3,000 doctors, epidemiologists, policy and communications experts, and diplomats operating under the direction of the WHO.</p>
<p>Gates&rsquo; book received praise from WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who fully agreed with his insistence that <em>&ldquo;we must act on Covid-19&rsquo;s lessons and innovate so that we can deliver swift, equitable health solutions to prevent the next pandemic.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While Gates is not a certified medical expert and did not finish college, his massive wealth has allowed him to effectively dominate global health policy via the Gates Foundation as the largest private contributor to the global health body, behind only the US government in terms of funding.</p>
<p>Gates has become a common name in discussions about Covid-19 not only thanks to the millions his foundation has poured into the development and distribution of vaccines, but also because of another TED Talk from 2015, in which the tech mogul first warned that the world was unprepared for an <em>&ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;</em> global pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that his country would respond if a NATO member came under attack</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed on Sunday that NATO has &ldquo;no intention&rdquo; of intervening in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but vowed that his country would respond to any attack on a NATO ally. Throughout the conflict, Turkey has attempted to balance its relationship with both the US-led bloc and Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NATO's position is clear. The alliance has no intention of interfering in the Ukrainian conflict,"</em> Cavusoglu told reporters on Sunday after a trip to Latin America.</p>
<p>However, Turkey&rsquo;s top diplomat added that<em> "in the event of the slightest attack on any ally, we will respond adequately.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>NATO is not a direct participant in the Ukraine conflict, but its member states have shipped weapons and ammunition to Volodymyr Zelensky&rsquo;s government, the US has <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554643-us-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared intelligence</a> with Kiev, and Ukrainian troops are being <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554764-us-training-ukraine-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trained</a>&nbsp;at NATO bases in Europe.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused NATO of <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy,&rdquo;</em> while Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554619-putin-strategic-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> outside players against intervening in the conflict last week, threatening to unleash a <em>&ldquo;swift, lightning-fast&rdquo;</em> response should Russia&rsquo;s security be put at risk.</p>

<p>Although a NATO member, Turkey fields some Russian weapons systems, and its insistence on purchasing the Russian-made S-400 air defense system saw it booted from the US&rsquo; F-35 jet fighter program in 2019.</p>
<p>Turkey has sought to maintain relations with both the bloc&nbsp;and Moscow since Russia&rsquo;s operation in Ukraine began in February. It has sold its domestically-produced Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, but has refused to impose sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Istanbul has hosted peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has offered to host talks between Putin and Zelensky.</p>
<p>Such talks have not yet materialized, and in an interview late last month with CNN Turk, Cavusoglu <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554248-turkey-ukraine-talks-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that <em>&ldquo;there are countries within NATO that want the war to continue,&rdquo;</em> in order to make Russia <em>&ldquo;weaker.&rdquo;</em> He did not, however, name any of those states.</p>
<p>The diplomat said that several South American leaders have offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, including Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who reportedly offered to visit Moscow for talks.</p>

<p><em>"Venezuela has good relations with Russia. Both Brazil and Venezuela have said that the war should be stopped,&rdquo;</em> Cavusoglu explained. <em>&ldquo;We said we would like to contribute to those efforts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

                            <p><strong>Originally established as an anti-Bolshevik endeavor, RFE/RL has thrived as US-Russia relations have nose-dived</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The first of May&nbsp;marks the 51st anniversary of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (hereinafter &ldquo;RFE/RL&rdquo;, although this didn't become the official name until 1976) &ndash; radio stations which broadcast into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, respectively. As detailed in an internal CIA document from 1951 titled &ldquo;<a href="https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/114359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Aims and Objectives</a>,&rdquo; RFE/RL was to be operated by refugees or exiles from the various Socialist Bloc countries to broadcast information intended to encourage <em>&ldquo;hatred against the regime(s)&rdquo;</em> and to increase the <em>&ldquo;will to resist the regime(s).&rdquo;</em> In other words, this project had an explicit function to remove governments unfavorable to Washington.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, May 1 was chosen as the launch of this project&nbsp;as it coincided with International Workers&rsquo; Day, one of the most important holidays in the Socialist Bloc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From its inception until 1972, it was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the CIA which funded RFE/RL</a>,&nbsp;though it did so covertly without congressional knowledge or authorization. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And it was CIA Director Allen Dulles</a> &ndash; <a href="https://www.wbur.org/npr/234752747/meet-the-brothers-who-shaped-u-s-policy-inside-and-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the mastermind behind the overthrow</a> of democratic governments in countries such as Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954) &ndash; who greenlit the secret financing of RFE/RL in the hope that it would contribute to the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Ironically, even as the CIA was backing this project, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was helping to restore fascist</a>, military rule to Greece &ndash; which it preferred to a Greek communist government. The left-wingers had great political stature among the electorate because of their valiant fight against the Nazis.</p>
<p>The memories of this betrayal by the West in Greece were awakened recently when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared by video before the Greek parliament <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/04/08/progressives-in-greece-reject-zelenskys-address-to-parliament-with-neo-nazis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alongside a neo-Nazi Azov fighter</a>, causing some of the members&nbsp;to get up and leave in protest.</p>
<p>The US and its CIA <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made similar choices</a> in countries&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Indonesia, and later Chile and Argentina, opting to support ultra-right-wing dictatorships in lieu of socialist, albeit democratic, governments. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cord Meyer</a>, who took charge of the CIA&rsquo;s relationship with Radio Liberty in 1954 and led these operations for many years, <em>&ldquo;[t]he CIA maintained control over [radio] content by formulating general policy guidelines, which were supplemented by daily meetings to determine the handling of specific news.&rdquo;</em> Meyer insists, however, that this control did not interfere with the journalistic integrity of the radio programs.</p>
<p>In addition, while Meyer insists that there were no actual spies operating within the radio stations, the radio personnel nevertheless kept detailed accounts of what they observed in the various countries in which they operated; in other words, they did provide intelligence for the CIA. And even after Congress ended CIA funding of RFE/RL&nbsp;in 1972 &ndash; the money&nbsp;would come <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly from Congress</a> from then on &ndash; its primary purpose remained to broadcast anti-communist programs into the East Bloc, at least until the communist governments in Eastern Europe and then the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
<p>Of course, RFE/RL&nbsp;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openly takes credit</a> for helping to bring about this ultimate collapse, believing that its influence whittled away at the support of the various communist governments. It&nbsp;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has found support for this claim</a> from the likes of Vaclav Havel (who invited RFE/RL&nbsp;to move from its original headquarters in Munich, Germany to Prague after the collapse of the East Bloc) and Boris Yeltsin.</p>

<p>I recall quite vividly, as someone who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, the incessant complaints that the Soviet Union would often jam the signals of Radio Liberty &ndash; evidence, we were told, that Moscow&nbsp;simply could not handle the truth. I think of this now as the outlet I am writing this article for &ndash; RT, of course a Russian-based news outlet &ndash; <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rt-sputnik-youtube-banned-europe-1235101699/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is being suppressed</a> in the US <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or outrightly banned in the EU</a>.</p>
<p>You may ask what this says about the EU and the US today.</p>
<p>RFE/RL&nbsp;would seem to be a relic of the bygone era of the Cold War when the US and the Soviet Union were vying for the hearts and minds of the world. Not only is the Cold War over, but it seems that most mainstream outlets &ndash; such as Fox, CNN and MSNBC &ndash; serve the same role as RFE/RL&nbsp;itself. And yet, RFE/RL&nbsp;continues to exist to this day, and indeed has received new life during the current crisis in Ukraine &ndash; a flashpoint&nbsp;which some observe as <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/new-cold-war-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the beginning of a new Cold War</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the fact that RFE/RL has broadcast continuously, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it begs the question of whether the first Cold War ever actually ended in the first place. Certainly, <a href="https://fpif.org/cold-war-never-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some observers</a>, myself included, believe that the stand-off&nbsp;didn't come to a conclusion, and we strain to understand why. I agree with John Feffer, <a href="https://fpif.org/cold-war-never-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing in <em>Foreign Policy in Focus</em></a>, who opined:</p>
<p>The Cold War, then, was not just about a confrontation between ideological foes. The Soviet Union dropped out of that competition and Russia under Putin continues to remain focused on concerns along its borders, unlike the USSR which sought global hegemony. The US, on the other hand, has not changed its attitude. And that, ultimately, is why the Cold War never died.</p>

<p>If Washington had disbanded NATO, pushed for nuclear disarmament, and helped to create a new security architecture for Europe that included Russia, the Cold War would have died a natural death. Instead, because the institutions of the Cold War lived on, the spirit of the enterprise lay dormant, only waiting for the opportunity to spring forth.</p>
<p>Of course, RFE/RL is one of the other <em>&ldquo;institutions of the Cold War [which] lived on,&rdquo;</em> arguably perpetuating the old Cold War antagonisms. For its part, <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the state-run outlet has justified</a> its continued existence as follows: <em>&ldquo;With the collapse of communism, some thought RFE/RL had fulfilled its mission and could be disbanded. But officials throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, many of them former dissidents, saw a continuing need for precisely the kind of objective broadcasts that RFE/RL provided, especially during democratic transition.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-radio-free-europe/radio-liberty-sets-out-to-break-russian-propaganda-wall/articleshow/89197613.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Economic Times explains</a>, <em>&ldquo;[b]ased in Prague, RFE/RL was founded in 1950 as an anti-communist outlet to beam programs into the Soviet bloc, helping topple those totalitarian regimes nearly four decades later. These days, it still broadcasts in 27 languages &ndash; including Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian &ndash; to 23 countries, many where media freedoms face severe restrictions.&rdquo;</em> As related in the same article, <em>&ldquo;RFE/RL, which has a target audience of 37 million people, stepped up activities in the region following Russia&rsquo;s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the occupation of eastern Ukraine by pro-Moscow rebel forces.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>With apparently no sense of irony, the <em>Economic Times</em>, in trumpeting the work of RFE/RL,<em> </em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-radio-free-europe/radio-liberty-sets-out-to-break-russian-propaganda-wall/articleshow/89197613.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">states that</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Russia very quickly understood that it is not necessary to lie to make successful propaganda. All you need is to withhold context and create white noise.&rdquo;</em> Of course, the US and Western media have realized the very same, with the situation in Ukraine being a case in point. Thus, much of the current Ukraine coverage in the West would lead the audience to believe that the crisis started suddenly in February of this year with the Russian offensive, while in fact <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/conflict-ukraines-donbas-visual-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there has been a conflict</a> between the government in Kiev and the Russian-speaking population of the Donbas for the past eight years, claiming 14,000 lives. This missing context is indeed quite misleading for the casual news consumer. Moreover, referring to the Russian speakers in the eastern part of Ukraine as &ldquo;pro-Moscow,&rdquo; as the <em>Economic Times</em> and nearly every other Western news outlet does, fails to capture the very real grievances of these people who have been militarily attacked by their own government for years &ndash; whether they are pro-Moscow or not is not really the critical issue here. But, I suppose, one person&rsquo;s propaganda is another person&rsquo;s news, and vice versa.</p>

<p>After the collapse of communism, RFE/RL&nbsp;followed wherever US foreign policy aims were focused. Thus, as <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it explains itself</a>, it started broadcasting in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s as the US and NATO began meddling there, and expanded beyond Europe in the late 1990s to Iraq and Iran <em>&ldquo;[r]eflecting American attention to the greater Middle East&hellip;&rdquo;</em> Also, in 2002, RFE/RL started broadcasting in Afghanistan again &ndash; it had initially done so in the 1980s during the Soviet occupation but discontinued broadcasting thereafter.</p>
<p>However, the state-controlled outlet&nbsp;has never lost its focus on Russia and Eastern Europe. Thus, in addition to increasing its reach&nbsp;in Ukraine, RFE/RL&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded</a> on&hellip; local news efforts between 2016 and 2019 by creating websites serving the needs of audiences in the&nbsp;North Caucasus,&nbsp;Middle Volga,&nbsp;Siberian, and&nbsp;Northwestern&nbsp;regions of Russia.&rdquo;</em> Beginning in 2019, RFE/RL, after leaving for a time after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, began to return to Romania, Bulgaria and later Hungary, <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/ecc79546280f27a0/Documents/a%20reversal%20in%20democratic%20gains%20and%20attacks%20on%20the%20rule%20of%20law%20and%20the%20judiciary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming</a> that it was needed <em>&ldquo;in light of a reversal in democratic gains and attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary&rdquo;</em> in those countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Cold War raging again between the US and Russia &ndash; whether it's viewed as new or simply a continuation of the old confrontation &ndash; RFE/RL&nbsp;will certainly have a <em>raison d&rsquo;etre </em>for some time to come, and its congressional funding (it's parent body, the US&nbsp;Agency for Global Media, received over $810 million in 2020) certainly be secured. While there can be disagreement over whether RFE/RL&nbsp;continues to be necessary after the end of communism, or whether it in fact can be seen as unnecessarily stoking old Cold War tensions, the one thing that can be said of RFE/RL is that it does not, and really cannot, hide what it is. That is, it is quite transparently a US-funded news source which broadcasts programing reflecting the foreign policy interests and views of the United States. <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It says so</a> on its own website.</p>
<p>Indeed, its aforementioned parent proudly boasts that it must be "<em>consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States</em>" and is obliged to have "<em>the capability to provide a surge capacity to support United States foreign policy objectives during crises abroad</em>." Again, no secret is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usagm.gov/who-we-are/oversight/legislation/standards-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made of this.</a></p>
<p>To be fair, this, in my view, makes RFE/RL&nbsp;less nefarious than other institutions &ndash; such as private broadcast news or even Hollywood movies which we know <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/operation-tinseltown-how-the-cia-manipulates-hollywood/491138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are heavily influenced by the CIA</a> &ndash; which claim to be objective arbiters of the truth and reality, but which really are not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that RFE/RL&nbsp;is lying, but it is certainly giving a slanted view of the world. But again, because this is quite obvious, the audience can at least make an intelligent judgment about the accuracy of what they are being told. Many times, that&rsquo;s the best we can ask for.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Adam Kinzinger’s resolution would allow President Biden to deploy American forces if Russia uses weapons of mass destruction</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, announced on Sunday that he will introduce a resolution authorizing the use of military force should Russia deploy <em>&ldquo;chemical, biological and/or nuclear weapons&rdquo;</em> in Ukraine. Kinzinger has continuously pushed for US involvement in the ongoing conflict, and previously backed measures that critics and President Biden said would lead to a <em>&ldquo;third world war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kinzinger&rsquo;s <a href="https://kinzinger.house.gov/uploadedfiles/kinzinger_aumf2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resolution</a> would authorize the president to use the American military to <em>&ldquo;assist in defending and restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> in response to a hypothetical Russian use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil.</p>
<p>The resolution would give the president sole authority to determine whether such aggression by Russia had actually taken place, without requiring any international investigation. Accordingly, it could incentivize Ukrainian forces to <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554487-white-helmets-instructors-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stage such an attack</a> in the hopes of drawing the US into the conflict, as commanders in Moscow have accused Kiev of planning.</p>
<p>As an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, the resolution would function like the post-9/11 AUMF that has been renewed every year since 2001. This authorization has given US presidents legal clearance to attack more than a dozen countries since 9/11, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen, without a formal declaration of war.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;As the President of the United States has said, Putin must be stopped,&rdquo;</em> read a statement from Kinzinger&rsquo;s office. <em>&ldquo;Accordingly, the Commander in Chief to the world&rsquo;s greatest military should have the authority and means to take the necessary actions to do so.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kinzinger, a Republican who aligns with Democrats on most issues, has publicly called for US involvement in the conflict already. Within a day of Russian forces entering Ukraine in February, Kinzinger was <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1497354030904975364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanding</a> that NATO enforce a &lsquo;no-fly zone&rsquo; over the country, a move that would see the US-led military alliance commit to shooting down Russian aircraft and striking Russian air defense systems.</p>
<p>While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also requested such a move, Biden has refused, saying that it would trigger a <em>&ldquo;third world war&rdquo;</em> with Russia. Kinzinger has also <a href="https://twitter.com/adamkinzinger/status/1501674992861204482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pressured</a> the Biden administration to send fighter jets donated by Poland into Ukraine, which the administration has refused. Citing the risks involved in having US pilots deliver warplanes into an active conflict zone, Biden again said that he wished to avoid <em>&ldquo;World War III.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is currently unclear if and when Kinzinger&rsquo;s resolution will be brought to a vote. Biden himself has said that the US &ldquo;<em>would respond</em>&rdquo; to any use of weapons of mass destruction by Russian forces in Ukraine, but has avoided drawing any binding &lsquo;red lines&rsquo;. Instead, the US has continued to ship weapons to Ukraine and is currently <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554764-us-training-ukraine-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training</a> Ukrainian soldiers on some of these weapons systems in Germany.</p>

<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>
