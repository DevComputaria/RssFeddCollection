<p>Tech giants Apple, Google, and Microsoft have announced extended support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium.

	<section class="page">
<p>Some odd and potentially dangerous behavior within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was revealed by cloud security company Mitiga Thursday. If GCP is not configured correctly, it could be exploited by attackers to engage in malicious activity inside a user's cloud environment, <a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/misconfiguration-hidden-dangers-cloud-control-plane" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">according to a blog</a> posted on the Israeli company's website.</p><p>The behavior is linked to one of the APIs used by Google Cloud. The API allows users to retrieve data from serial ports, but by creating a virtual machine in the cloud, data could also be continuously written to the ports. Moreover, because of the way Google Cloud classifies such traffic, administrators aren't given much visibility into it. If an attacker were exploiting the behavior, their constant calls to the ports might tip their hand, Mitiga explained, but the malicious activity is likely to be missed by developers unfamiliar with the specifics of the API.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3660070/wrongly-configured-google-cloud-api-potentially-creates-dangerous-functionality.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Identity and access management (IAM) has long been a key proving ground of security leaders’ careers, with many a make-or-break decision made over identity technology deployments. Assuring secure access and managing identities is at the very foundation of cybersecurity postures. At the same time, the ways people, applications and systems log in and integrate with one another are also visible touchpoints for the business stakeholders. Security pros walk a tightrope of usability and security.<p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3616829/8-top-identity-and-access-management-tools.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]>(Insider Story)</description>

<h3><strong>The transition into CWPP <br/><br/></strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Agility and flexibility were key directives in the development of new technology, which is why on-premise assets soon transitioned into virtual machines, which further transformed into compact and swift containers. Modern enterprise network environments are increasingly transforming to be cloud-based, where both applications and data storage are hosted in a cloud — and often multi-cloud — environment. The attack surfaces and security protection requirements of software in distributed cloud environments are vastly different from traditional network architectures where applications and data were hosted on enterprise-owned servers in on-premises data centers.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3659868/cwpp-how-to-secure-cloud-native-applications-built-with-containers.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether a company utilizes a private, hybrid or public cloud infrastructure or offers cloud services to others, it is critical that each cloud instance and service be isolated to help minimize the risk of data compromise. In a traditional network, networking equipment and firewalls segment and isolate physical servers and other devices. However, to effectively isolate cloud instances, technologies like <a href="https://www.hillstonenet.com/solutions/micro-segmentation/" rel="nofollow">micro-segmentation</a> are needed.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-segmentation can help minimize damage caused by a compromised cloud asset. It can reduce the severity to a contained incident that can be remediated quickly versus an expansive data breach that spans multiple parts of the business, or numerous clients in a multi-tenant service. While proper implementation of micro-segmentation is vital, at a high-level view it can be summarized as a 5-step process.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3659791/protecting-cloud-assets-in-5-steps-with-micro-segmentation.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Software-defined wide area networking, or <a href="https://www.hillstonenet.com/solutions/secure-sd-wan-for-enterprise/" rel="nofollow">SD-WAN</a>, is the next frontier for the network edge. Multiple analysts report that the SD-WAN market is in the billions of dollars, with an annual growth rate in the 25% to 35% range. Managed service providers and carriers globally are increasingly deploying managed SD-WAN services to reach new markets. Almost all networking and security vendors have SD-WAN offerings, complicating the decision when choosing an SD-WAN solution.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Security and WAN connectivity decisions have become a collaborative decision between the security and networking teams. Prior to this, enterprise networking teams were responsible for setting up connectivity to major company locations, while connections to branches and remote offices fell to the enterprise WAN manager. In the meantime, dedicated security teams were tasked with procuring, deploying, and managing firewalls.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3659828/sd-wan-and-cybersecurity-two-sides-of-the-same-coin.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>GitHub has announced its largest-ever push toward two-factor authentication (2FA). The world’s leading development platform said it will require all code-contributing users to enroll in 2FA by the end of 2023 to enhance the security of developer accounts and bolster security within the software supply chain.

<p>Researchers from cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike have detected a denial-of-service (DoS) attack compromising Docker Engine honeypots to target Russian and Belarusian websites amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

      <title>9 most important steps for SMBs to defend against ransomware attacks</title>

<p>What is the best way for a small- to medium-sized business (SMB) to protect itself from ransomware? Ransomware is impacting firms around the world. <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/rpt-m-Prediction22-000410-02.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mandiant</a> has indicated that ransomware is on the rise and doesn’t appear to be slowing down one bit. These are the nine tasks that SMBs should focus on to mitigate risk from ransomware attacks.</p><h2>1. Have a backup plan and tested recovery process</h2>
<p>Some might argue that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is the best way to protect a firm, but I’d argue that having a tested <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3627828/ransomware-recovery-8-steps-to-successfully-restore-from-backup.html">backup and recovery process</a> would be better. Too often businesses overlook having a backup and a tested recovery process. Especially for firms with on-premises servers and domain controllers, have a process where someone – in the firm or a consultant or managed service provider -- perform a dry run of an actual recovery process. When I’ve done a dry run, I often find that I need to perform some step that I’ve forgotten to restore from a bare metal process. You may find that a HyperV parent needs additional steps or you need to take ownership of the restoration image to fully restore a Hyper V server or virtual machine to full working condition. Ensure that you have a recovery script or manual in place so that staff tasked to recover know the steps. The documented steps will help lower the stress of the event.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658852/9-most-important-steps-for-smbs-to-defend-against-ransomware-attacks.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Multiple series of network switches manufactured by Aruba Networks, owned by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Avaya, owned by Extreme Networks, are vulnerable to attacks that could allow attackers to break network segmentation, exfiltrate data from internal networks to the internet, and escape captive portals.

These flaws, collectively dubbed <a href="https://www.armis.com/research/tlstorm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TLStorm 2.0</a>, could enable attackers to take full control, often without authentication, of switches that are deployed in a wide variety of enterprise networks and are also used to isolate public-facing network segments in airports, hospitals, hotels and other organizations.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658834/tls-implementation-flaws-open-aruba-and-avaya-network-switches-to-rce-attacks.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

      <title>Secrets to building a healthy CISO-vendor partnership</title>

<p>Effective partnerships between CISOs and their cybersecurity vendors are integral to security success. A well-oiled relationship built on trust, communication and mutual understanding can reap significant benefits for a business’s cybersecurity posture. Conversely, one that is problematic and incohesive can have the opposite effect, negatively impacting a company’s security practices and leaving them vulnerable to risks and wasted investment.</p><p>“For CISOs, maintaining a positive relationship with their security vendors is an important element in staying informed on industry related trends, providing competitive analysis on alternative solutions and building trust in order to take on large partner-enabled initiatives,” John Hellickson, executive advisor at cybersecurity consultancy Coalfire, tells CSO. He notes that CISOs often have a select group of key security vendors that have become trusted partners where the relationship is mutually beneficial. “When CISOs fail to maintain positive working relationships with their security vendors they will often see their vendor provide less of a priority on their needs and overall responsiveness can be delayed, and in worst cases they may be flagged as a toxic account that no sales representative wants to be assigned,” he says.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658976/secrets-to-a-building-a-healthy-ciso-vendor-partnership.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<h2>Computer virus definition</h2>
<p>A computer virus is a form of malicious software that piggybacks onto legitimate application code in order to spread and reproduce itself.</p><p>Like other <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2615925/security-your-quick-guide-to-malware-types.html">types of malware</a>, a virus is deployed by attackers to damage or take control of a computer. Its name comes from the method by which it infects its targets. A biological virus like HIV or the flu cannot reproduce on its own; it needs to hijack a cell to do that work for it, wreaking havoc on the infected organism in the process. Similarly, a computer virus isn't itself a standalone program. It's a code snippet that inserts itself into some other application. When that application runs, it executes the virus code, with results that range from the irritating to the disastrous.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3406446/computer-viruses-explained-definition-types-and-examples.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Several threat groups believed to be initial access facilitators for some ransomware gangs are transitioning to a new first-stage malware downloader dubbed Bumblebee. The groups previously used other downloaders like BazaLoader and IcedID.</p><p>According to researchers from security firm Proofpoint, Bumblebee email-based distribution campaigns started in March and were linked back to at least three known attack groups. The malware is used to deploy known penetration testing implants such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver and Meterpreter. Attackers have adopted these attack frameworks and other open-source dual-use tools in recent years to engage in hands-on manual hacking and lateral movement through victim networks.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658992/new-malware-loader-bumblebee-adopted-by-known-ransomware-access-brokers.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Phishing continues to be one of the primary attack mechanisms for bad actors with a variety of endgames in mind, in large part because phishing attacks are trivial to launch and difficult to fully protect against. Some phishing attacks target customers rather than employees, and others simply aim to damage your corporate reputation rather than compromise your systems. A key factor in protecting your business from phishing is to understand your vulnerabilities, weigh the potential risk to your business, and decide what tools offer the best protection to match your business needs.</p><h2>Why phishing is successful</h2>
<p>Most phishing attacks are less about the technology and more about social engineering. It’s amazing how easily humans are manipulated when emotions are triggered. Many modern phishing emails play on empathy or fear, or even make hostile accusations in order to trigger an angry response.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3575080/9-top-anti-phishing-tools-and-services.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
