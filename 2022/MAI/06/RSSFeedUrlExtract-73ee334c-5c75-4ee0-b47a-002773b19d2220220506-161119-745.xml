<h2><strong>The true covid death toll could be more than double what’s been reported</strong></h2>



<p><strong>The news:</strong> The true death toll of the pandemic is far higher than official figures suggest , according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While 5.4 million global deaths from covid had been reported by the end of 2021, the actual number was likely to be closer to 15 million, the WHO estimated. This suggests that many counties undercounted deaths.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How it was calculated:</strong> The WHO’s figures are based on excess mortality, which counts the number of deaths above how many people would have been expected to die without the pandemic. This allows it to calculate both the number of people who died directly as a result of covid and those who died indirectly, for example patients who didn’t receive care for other health conditions. The WHO believes the majority of the extra 9.5 million deaths were directly caused by the virus.</p>



<p>India, which was overwhelmed by the highly infectious Delta variant last year,&nbsp; was the country with by far the highest death toll. The WHO estimates that 4.7 million people in India had died of covid by the end of last year, dwarfing the 481,000 officially reported deaths. That would mean India accounted for close to a third of covid deaths globally. The Indian government has rejected the methodology, saying it has “concerns” about the process and outcome.</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Measuring the number of excess deaths is designed to paint a clearer picture of the pandemic’s global impact, particularly for low-income countries where testing and death registration may be inconsistent. While the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/curious-coincidence/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">origins of the virus</a> are still shrouded in mystery, working with true death estimates can help authorities establish what went wrong, and, crucially for future pandemics, how deaths could have been prevented.</p>

<h2><strong>The gene-edited pig heart given to a dying patient was infected with a pig virus</strong></h2>



<p>The pig heart transplanted into an American patient earlier this year in a landmark operation was infected with a porcine virus that may have derailed the experiment and contributed to his death two months later, MIT Technology Review has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/04/1051725/xenotransplant-patient-died-received-heart-infected-with-pig-virus/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">learned</a>.<br><br>David Bennett Sr. was close to death in January when he received a genetically edited pig heart in a pioneering transplant that was initially hailed as a success. The 57-year old’s new heart was pumping fantastically within just a few days of surgery, and performing like a “rock star,” according to his transplant surgeon.<br><br>But, unknown to doctors, Bennett’s heart was affected by porcine cytomegalovirus, a hard-to-detect but preventable infection linked to devastating effects on transplants. The infection may have been a potential contributor to his illness and eventual death, specialists have said, and may explain why the heart did not last longer. It suggests the experiment was compromised by an unforced error, meaning researchers may have to go back to the drawing board. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/04/1051725/xenotransplant-patient-died-received-heart-infected-with-pig-virus/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The pig heart transplanted into an American patient earlier this year in a landmark operation carried a porcine virus that may have derailed the experiment and contributed to his death two months later, say transplant specialists.</p>



<p>David Bennett Sr. was near death in January when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html">he received a genetically edited pig heart</a> in a pioneering between-species transplant that has been hailed as a success—and was, at first.</p>



<p>A few days after his heart was replaced with one from a pig, Bennett was sitting up in bed. His new heart was pumping fantastically and performing like a “rock star,” according to his transplant surgeon, Bartley Griffith of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</p>



<p>But about 40 days later Bennett, who was 57, took a turn for the worse. After two months he was dead. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html">a statement</a> released by the university in March, a spokesperson said there was “no obvious cause identified at the time of his death” and that a full report was pending.</p>



<p>Now MIT Technology Review has learned that Bennett’s heart was affected by porcine cytomegalovirus, a preventable infection that is linked to devastating effects on transplants. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The presence of the pig virus and the desperate efforts to defeat it were described by Griffith during <a href="https://www.myast.org/t3-webinar-xenotransplantation-pig-human-heart-transplant">a webinar</a> streamed online by the American Society of Transplantation on April 20. The issue is now a subject of wide discussion among specialists, who think the infection was a potential contributor to Bennett’s death and a possible reason why the heart did not last longer.</p>



<p>“We are beginning to learn why he passed on,” said Griffith, who believes that the virus “maybe was the actor, or could be the actor, that set this whole thing off.”</p>



<p>The heart swap in Maryland was a major test of xenotransplantation, the process of moving tissues between species. But because the special pigs raised to provide organs are supposed to be virus-free, it now appears that the experiment was compromised by an unforced error. The biotechnology company that raised and engineered the pigs, Revivicor, declined to comment and has made no public statement about the virus.</p>



<p>“It was surprising. That pig is supposed to be clean of all pig pathogens, and this is a significant one,” says Mike Curtis, CEO of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/12/239014/crispr-pig-organs-are-being-implanted-in-monkeys-to-see-if-theyre-safe-for-humans/">eGenesis</a>, a competing company that is also breeding pigs for transplant organs. “Without the virus, would Mr. Bennett have lived? We don’t know, but the infection didn’t help. It likely contributed to the failure.”</p>



<h3><strong>10-gene pig &nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The detection of the pig virus in Bennett&#8217;s heart is not necessarily all bad news for xenotransplantation. If a pig virus played a role, it could mean a virus-free heart xenotransplant could last much longer. Some surgeons think the latest gene-modified organs could in theory keep beating for years—and more rigorous procedures should be able to screen out the virus.</p>



<p>“If this was an infection, we can likely prevent it in the future,” Griffith said during his presentation<em>.</em></p>



<p>The biggest obstacle to animal-organ transplants is the human immune system, which ferociously attacks foreign cells in a process called rejection. To avoid rejection, companies have been engineering pigs—removing some genes and adding others—to give their tissue a stealth profile that hides from immune attack.</p>





<p>The version used in Maryland came from a pig with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01238-w">10 gene modifications</a> developed by Revivicor, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/08/12/248193/surgeons-smash-records-with-pig-to-primate-organ-transplants/">promising tests of such pig organs in baboons</a>, three US transplant teams launched the first human studies starting in late 2021. Surgeons at New York University and the University of Alabama each attached pig kidneys to brain-dead people, but the University of Maryland went a step further when Griffith stitched a pig heart into Bennett’s chest in early January.</p>



<p>Transferring pig viruses to humans has been a worry—some fear xenotransplantation could set off a pandemic if a virus were to adapt inside a patient’s body and then spread to doctors and nurses. The concern could be serious enough to require lifelong monitoring for patients.</p>



<p>However, the specific type of virus found in Bennett’s donor heart is not believed capable of infecting human cells, says Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infections at Massachusetts General Hospital. Fishman thinks there is “no real risk to humans” of its spreading further.</p>



<p>Instead, the problem is that pig cytomegalovirus is linked to reactions that can damage the organ and the patient—with catastrophic results. Two years ago, for instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067513/">German researchers</a> reported that pig hearts transplanted into baboons lasted only a couple of weeks if the virus was present, while organs free from the infection could survive more than half a year.</p>



<p>Those researchers said they found “astonishingly high” virus levels in pig hearts removed from baboons. They think the virus could go haywire not just because the baboons’ immune systems were suppressed with drugs, but also because the pig immune system was no longer there to keep the virus in check. It “seems very likely the same may happen in humans,” they warned at the time.</p>

</figure></div>



<p>Joachim Denner of the Institute of Virology at the Free University of Berlin, who led that study, says the solution to the problem is more accurate testing. The US team appears to have tested the pig’s snout for the virus, but often it is lurking deeper in the tissues.</p>



<p>“It’s a latent virus and hard to detect,” says Denner. “But if you test the animal better, it will not happen. The virus can be detected and easily removed from pig populations, but unfortunately they didn’t use a good assay and didn’t detect the virus, and this was the reason. The donor pig was infected, and the virus was transmitted by the transplant.”</p>



<p>Denner says he still thinks the experiment was a “great success.” For instance, the first human-to-human heart transplant, in 1967, lasted only 18 days and, two years later, one in Germany endured just 27 hours. </p>



<p>Denner says that Bennett’s death cannot be blamed on the virus alone. “This patient was very, very, very ill. Do not forget that,” he says. “Maybe the virus contributed, but it was not the sole reason.”</p>



<h3><strong>Cause of death</strong>?</h3>



<p></p>



<p>Bennett’s cause of death matters, because if his heart failed as the result of immune rejection, researchers might need to return to the drawing board. Instead, it’s now expected that companies like United Therapeutics and eGenesis, or academics working with them, will launch clinical trials of their pig organs within a year or two.</p>



<p>Bennett was offered a pig heart after Griffith applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for special permission to try an animal organ in a one-off transplant. He was considered a good candidate for the daring attempt because he was nearing death from heart failure and was ineligible for a scarce human heart for transplant owing to a history of disregarding medical advice.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=story-cta&amp;utm_campaign=subscribe-BAU">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>On December 31, 2021, the FDA sent Griffith an email saying he could proceed to treat Bennett for “irreversible heart failure” if the patient and ethics monitors agreed.</p>



<p>Bennett’s condition remained fragile all along. Still, after the operation, his new pig heart was squeezing powerfully and looking “super normal,” according to Griffith. Even a biopsy taken on day 34 showed no signs of the feared immune attack.</p>



<p>“It was quite amazing. You go talk to this gentleman and he’s got a pig heart. Literally, he has a pig heart,” Griffith said. The result was all but miraculous, yet Griffith acknowledged that the medical team was in anguish about whether they were doing the right thing.</p>



<p>In some ways, he says, they were like a “blind group of squirrels” scurrying to manage Bennett&#8217;s unprecedented condition as the days ticked by.</p>



<p>To keep tabs on the health of the pig heart, Griffith said, the team was constantly checking their patient with an array of cutting-edge blood tests. They used a DNA sequencer to scan his blood for floating fragments of pig genes—any increase would be a sign that heart cells were dying. Another novel test, developed by a company called Karius, screened Bennett’s blood for traces of hundreds of bacteria and viruses.</p>



<p>It was that test, run on a blood draw taken from Bennett 20 days after his surgery, that first returned “a little blip” indicating the presence of porcine cytomegalovirus, according to Griffith. But the levels were so low that the team thought the result could be in error, Griffith said, especially since the pigs were supposedly guaranteed free of the germ.</p>



<p>The doctors faced another problem—the special blood test was taking about 10 days to carry out. So they couldn’t yet know that inside Bennett’s new heart, the pig virus was starting to multiply fast and setting off what Griffith now believes was a possible “cytokine explosion”—a storm of immune-system molecules.</p>



<p>Even without up-to-the-minute tests, a serious problem became apparent around day 43 of the experiment. That day, Bennett woke up warm to the touch and breathing hard. “He looked really funky. Something happened to him. He looked infected,” said Griffith. “He lost his attention and wouldn’t talk to us.” </p>



<p>The doctors then faced a common problem in transplant medicine: how to fight infections while still keeping the patient’s immune system in check. And they were also handicapped by what they didn’t know. Not only were they still guessing at the true extent of the infection, but no one had ever treated a human for this particular pig virus, according to Griffith&#8217;s account.</p>





<p>They ended up giving Bennett a last-resort drug called cidofovir, sometimes used in AIDS patients. And since his immune system was so weak, they also gave him intravenous immunoglobulin—antibodies collected from blood donors.</p>



<p>Bennett looked better 24 hours later and was sitting up in a chair, “so we were all kind of relaxing—we dodged that bump,” says Griffith. But the relief didn’t last long. A week later Bennett’s again looked terrible and his heart started to fail.</p>



<p>Now Griffith wonders if Bennett was hit by the same syndrome previously seen in baboons that received infected pig hearts. Somehow, the virus sets off a wider inflammation response, causing swelling and other effects.</p>



<p>Mass General’s Fishman says from what he’s heard of Bennett’s case, “it does sound like the syndrome was driven by [the virus].”</p>



<p>Still, it’s too soon to say for sure why Bennett died and researchers are still sifting through complex and contradictory clues. The doctors also worry they made a mistake by giving him human antibodies—something they did twice. Later tests showed that those blood products had contained some anti-pig antibodies and they might have damaged the organ too.</p>



<p>Even so, Griffith said that a biopsy of Bennett’s pig heart late in the experiment did not show telltale signs it had been rejected by his immune system—which had been the biggest fear all along, and what the special gene-edited pigs were designed to avoid in the first place.</p>



<p>Instead, the pattern of damage—which was unusually “bland,” according to Griffith—was similar to that seen in the German baboons. During his presentation, Griffith painted a picture of how the viral syndrome might have caused the heart to fail—starting with that unexpected “blip” in a test result, building to a bigger infection, and then releasing a damaging cascade of inflammation.</p>



<p>“I personally suspect he developed a capillary leak in response to his inflammatory explosion, and that filled his heart with edema, the edema turned into fibrotic tissue, and he went into severe and unreversing diastolic heart failure,” said Griffith.</p>



<p>The researchers involved have said the procedure was worth it because of the “invaluable insights” they gained. In a statement released by the university in March, Bennett’s son shared similar sentiments. “We also hope that what was learned from his surgery will benefit future patients and hopefully one day, end the organ shortage that costs so many lives each year,”<a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2022/IN-MEMORIAM-David-Bennett-Sr.html"> he said</a>.</p>



<p>However, the presence of the virus—whose risks were already well documented—could now factor into <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/14/questions-about-the-pig-heart-transplant/">some people’s questions </a>over whether the experiment should have taken place at all. “It’s a big red flag,” says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University. If doctors can’t prevent or control infection, “then such experiments are tough to justify.” Caplan says he has concerns about whether the risky procedure was appropriate, since Bennett was clinging to life and his ability to consent or end his participation isn&#8217;t clear.   </p>



<p>Bennett’s doctors have called him a bold volunteer who showed plenty of fight. “These losses are hard,” Griffith said during the webinar. “This was a patient. It wasn&#8217;t an experiment to us. All he wanted to do was live. In fact, he was such a funny guy. On the way in to get his pig heart transplant, he looked at me and he said squarely, ‘Are you sure I can’t get a human heart?’”</p>

<p><strong>Open to ideas: </strong>Meta’s AI lab has created a massive new language model, and in an unprecedented move for Big Tech, it is giving it away to researchers—together with details about how it was built. Large language models—powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation—have become one of the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/21/1042835/2021-was-the-year-of-monster-ai-models/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">hottest trends in AI</a> in the last couple of years.

So far, the wider research community has been shut out, with large language models solely the domain of rich tech firms.&nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Meta’s AI lab has created a massive new language model that shares both <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017797/gpt3-best-worst-ai-openai-natural-language/">the remarkable abilities and the harmful flaws</a> of OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">pioneering neural network GPT-3</a>. And in an unprecedented move for Big Tech, it is giving it away to researchers—together with <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/democratizing-access-to-large-scale-language-models-with-opt-175b/">details about how it was built and trained</a>.</p>



<p>“We strongly believe that the ability for others to scrutinize your work is an important part of research. We really invite that collaboration,” says Joelle Pineau, a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/12/1011944/artificial-intelligence-replication-crisis-science-big-tech-google-deepmind-facebook-openai/">longtime advocate for transparency in the development of technology</a>, who is now managing director at Meta AI.</p>



<p>Meta’s move is the first time that a fully trained large language model will be made available to any researcher who wants to study it. The news has been welcomed by many concerned about the way this powerful technology is being built by small teams behind closed doors.</p>



<p>“I applaud the transparency here,” says Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington and a frequent critic of the way language models are developed and deployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a great move,” says Thomas Wolf, chief scientist at Hugging Face, the AI startup behind <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/20/1025135/ai-large-language-models-bigscience-project/">BigScience</a>, a project in which more than 1,000 volunteers around the world are collaborating on an open-source language model. “The more open models the better,” he says. </p>



<p>Large language models—powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation—have become one of the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/21/1042835/2021-was-the-year-of-monster-ai-models/">hottest trends in AI</a> in the last couple of years. But they have <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/">deep flaws</a>, parroting misinformation, prejudice, and toxic language.</p>



<p>In theory, putting more people to work on the problem should help. Yet because language models require vast amounts of data and computing power to train, they have so far remained&nbsp;projects for rich tech firms. The wider research community, including ethicists and social scientists concerned about their misuse, has had to watch from the sidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=story-cta&amp;utm_campaign=subscribe-BAU">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Meta AI says it wants to change that. “Many of us have been university researchers,” says Pineau. “We know the gap that exists between universities and industry in terms of the ability to build these models. Making this one available to researchers was a no-brainer.” She hopes that others will pore over their work and pull it apart or build on it. Breakthroughs come faster when more people are involved, she says.</p>



<p>Meta is making its model, called Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT), available for non-commercial use. It is also releasing its code and a logbook that documents the training process. The logbook contains daily updates from members of the team about the training data: how it was added to the model and when, what worked and what didn’t. In more than 100 pages of notes, the researchers log every bug, crash, and reboot in a three-month training process that ran nonstop from October 2021 to January 2022.</p>



<p>With 175 billion parameters (the values in a neural network that get tweaked during training), OPT is the same size as GPT-3. This was by design, says Pineau. The team built OPT to match GPT-3 both in its accuracy on language tasks and in its toxicity. OpenAI has made GPT-3 available as a paid service but has not shared the model itself or its code. The idea was to provide researchers with a similar language model to study, says Pineau.</p>



<p>OpenAI declined an invitation to comment on Meta’s announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google, which is exploring the use of large language models in its search products, has also been criticized for a lack of transparency. The company sparked controversy in 2020 when <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/16/1014634/google-ai-ethics-lead-timnit-gebru-tells-story/">it forced out leading members of its AI ethics team</a> after they produced <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">a study that highlighted problems with the technology</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Culture clash</h3>



<p>So why is Meta doing this? After all, Meta is a company that has said little about how the algorithms behind Facebook and Instagram work and has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/">a reputation for burying unfavorable findings</a> by its own in-house research teams. A big reason for the different approach by Meta AI is Pineau herself, who has been pushing for more transparency in AI for a number of years.</p>





<p>Pineau helped change how research is published in several of the largest conferences, introducing a checklist of things that researchers must submit alongside their results, including code and details about how experiments are run. Since she joined Meta (then Facebook) in 2017, she has championed that culture in its AI lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That commitment to open science is why I’m here,” she says. “I wouldn’t be here on any other terms.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, Pineau wants to change how we judge AI. “What we call state-of-the-art nowadays can’t just be about performance,” she says. “It has to be state-of-the-art in terms of responsibility as well.”</p>



<p>Still, giving away a large language model is a bold move for Meta. “I can’t tell you that there’s no risk of this model producing language that we’re not proud of,” says Pineau. “It will.”</p>



<h3>Weighing the risks</h3>



<p>Margaret Mitchell, one of the AI ethics researchers Google forced out in 2020, who is now at Hugging Face, sees the release of OPT as a positive move. But she thinks there are limits to transparency. Has the language model been tested with sufficient rigor? Do the foreseeable benefits outweigh the foreseeable harms—such as the generation of misinformation, or racist and misogynistic language?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Releasing a large language model to the world where a wide audience is likely to use it, or be affected by its output, comes with responsibilities,” she says. Mitchell notes that this model will be able to generate harmful content not only by itself, but through downstream applications that researchers build on top of it.</p>



<p>Meta AI audited OPT to remove some harmful behaviors, but the point is to release a model that researchers can learn from, warts and all, says Pineau.</p>



<p>“There were a lot of conversations about how to do that in a way that lets us sleep at night, knowing that there’s a non-zero risk in terms of reputation, a non-zero risk in terms of harm,” she says. She dismisses the idea that you should not release a model because it’s too dangerous—which is the reason OpenAI gave for not releasing GPT-3’s predecessor, GPT-2. “I understand the weaknesses of these models, but that’s not a research mindset,” she says.</p>





<p>Bender, who coauthored the study at the center of the Google dispute with Mitchell, is also concerned about how the potential harms will be handled. “One thing that is really key in mitigating the risks of any kind of machine-learning technology is to ground evaluations and explorations in specific use cases,” she says. “What will the system be used for? Who will be using it, and how will the system outputs be presented to them?”</p>



<p>Some researchers question why large language models are being built at all, given their potential for harm. For Pineau, these concerns should be met with more exposure, not less. “I believe the only way to build trust is extreme transparency,” she says.</p>



<p>“We have different opinions around the world about what speech is appropriate, and AI is a part of that conversation,” she says. She doesn’t expect language models to say things that everyone agrees with. “But how do we grapple with that? You need many voices in that discussion.”</p>

<h2><strong>This company wants to use carbon dioxide to store renewable power on the grid</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Sourcing power: </strong>Renewable power has been growing worldwide, but sources like wind and solar aren’t available consistently. In the quest to find a better way to store power for the grid, an Italian startup called Energy Dome is turning to an unlikely source: carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Energy Dome turned to carbon dioxide because of its physics. When squeezed to high enough pressures, it turns into a liquid, which can be stored in small steel tanks close to where renewable energy is generated and used. Energy Dome’s technology is designed to allow the carbon dioxide to be accessed as needed and turned into electricity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Greater flexibility: </strong>The company has already started trials and promises it will soon be able to safely and cheaply store energy using carbon dioxide sourced from commercial vendors. However, experts warn it may take longer than expected, due to the scale of the engineering challenges involved. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/03/1051644/carbon-dioxide-storage-energy-dome/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a>.</p>

<p>In the quest to find a better way to store power for the grid, an Italian startup is turning to an unlikely source: carbon dioxide. The company, called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://energydome.com/" target="_blank">Energy Dome</a>, has built a test facility to put the greenhouse gas to work in energy storage.</p>





<p>Renewable power has been growing worldwide, but sources like wind and solar aren’t available consistently, creating a need for storage solutions. Today, most large-scale energy storage uses lithium-ion batteries, which are expensive, or pumped <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/01/1048726/droughts-are-cutting-into-californias-hydropower-heres-what-that-means-for-clean-energy/">hydropower</a>, which is only available in certain places. Cheap energy storage systems that can be deployed anywhere could unlock new potential for renewable power.</p>



<p>Energy Dome thinks carbon dioxide could have a role to play. The company says its demonstration plant, where it has designed and begun trials, will soon be able to safely and cheaply store energy using carbon dioxide sourced from commercial vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compressing gases to store energy isn’t new: for decades, a few facilities around the world have been pumping air into huge underground caverns under pressure and then using it to generate electricity in a natural gas power plant. But Energy Dome turned to carbon dioxide because of its physics.</p>



<p>Carbon dioxide, when squeezed to high enough pressures, turns into a liquid, which air doesn’t do unless cooled down to ultra-low temperatures. The liquid carbon dioxide can fit into smaller steel tanks close to where renewable energy is generated and used.</p>



<p>In Energy Dome’s designs, a flexible membrane holds the carbon dioxide in a huge dome at low pressure. When excess electricity is available, the gas goes through a compressor to reach high pressure. This process also generates heat, which is stored too.</p>



<p>Then, when energy is needed, the stored heat is used to warm up the carbon dioxide, which decompresses and turns a turbine, generating electricity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="The CO2 Battery | EnergyDome" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dpLVrxNjcC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Energy Dome’s CEO, Claudio Spadacini, says its first full-scale plants should cost just under $200 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), compared with about $300 per kWh for a lithium-ion <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79236.pdf" target="_blank">energy storage system</a> today. Spadacini says that the costs could drop further, to about $100 per kWh, if the company is able to scale up to a few dozen large facilities. </p>



<p>The concept of compressed carbon dioxide storage is “really promising,” says <a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/meme/staff/edward-barbour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward Barbour</a>, an energy systems researcher at Loughborough University in the UK. However, he expects the company to face some significant engineering challenges, like keeping the heat exchangers working for the decades-long lifetime of the plant. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=story-cta&amp;utm_campaign=subscribe-BAU">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>The demonstration facility where Energy Dome recently started trials has a capacity of 4 megawatt-hours, enough to power the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average American home</a> for about four and a half months. Spadacini says that after the demonstration facility is running, Energy Dome will move quickly to 200-MWh commercial-scale plants, aiming to begin construction as early as next year at a site in Italy.</p>



<p>The engineering challenges are “not insurmountable, but they’re not insignificant,” Barbour says. That means that the timelines Spadacini has quoted for scale-up might not be feasible, Barbour cautions: “I think there are kinks to be worked out that might take a little bit longer.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Research shows that businesses, governments, and consumers around the world are <a href="https://fsc.org/en/newsfeed/2021-global-consumer-research-reveals-escalating-concerns-about-climate-change-and-threats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly</a> concerned about the environment. But despite our apparent concern, we seem to be doing very little about it. Per a recent report, material extraction and use has nearly quadrupled in the last <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 years</a>, outpacing even population growth. The current economy is built on a linear approach where organizations harvest Earth’s natural resources, then create and sell products to consumers who eventually use and throw away these products. It is estimated that over 100 billion tons of material are harvested and consumed every year, with more than 90% ending up in landfills without being recycled.</p>



<p>The circular economy aims to change all this by promoting a more sustainable approach where natural resources are extracted efficiently; production is carried out in a manner where there is minimum wastage; and at the end of the product’s life, materials are recovered, regenerated, repaired, and reused for as long as possible so that businesses no longer have to extract virgin natural resources to fuel demand. The circular economy has the potential to significantly reduce pressure on the environment, create a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/impact/helping-the-circular-economy-become-a-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-trillion</a> dollar economy, stimulate innovation, and create <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90343657/the-circular-economy-could-create-an-enormous-jobs-boom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enormous</a> numbers of jobs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="833" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?w=1200" alt="" class="wp-image-1050756" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png 1200w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?resize=768,533 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>What’s stopping the circular economy from taking over?</strong></h3>



<p>Achieving a circular economy is easier said than done. Even the most well-intentioned companies can run into major obstacles while going down the circular economy path. According to <a href="https://www.cips.org/supply-management/news/2021/april/four-supply-chain-barriers-to-the-circular-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gartner</a>, there are four main challenges to the circular economy. First, returning ownership of end-of-life materials can be challenging. Organizations must do a deep dive in understanding how products are consumed and promote new supply chain models where expired products return to manufacturers. Second, raw materials must have enough residual value at end-of-life so they continue to be relevant to the business. Third, for businesses to make a compelling case to stakeholders, they must first possess an understanding of the quality, quantity, and intrinsic value of raw materials being returned. Fourth, the complexity of the product matters— the less complex the product being returned, the easier and cheaper the reprocessing, and vice versa.</p>



<h3><strong>How digitization of supply chains can boost circular economies</strong></h3>



<p>Digital innovation and the circular economy are kind of symbiotic in nature. In times of increasing internet proliferation, it’s hard to imagine any circular economy initiative that isn’t aided through technology. While there can be a number of ways in which digitization can positively impact the circular economy, here are the top three:</p>



<h4>1. <strong>Digitization can help organizations make better, more sustainable decisions</strong>.</h4>



<p>Digital technologies enable information to travel alongside the product. This enables businesses to capture, store, and analyze consumption patterns, which in turn helps organizations make better decisions. For example, research shows that <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">70%</a> of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are related to material handling and use. If businesses have insights into how full their aircraft, ship, or truck is, they can determine in real time how efficient their delivery will be. This translates to better efficiency, lower fuel costs, shorter delivery cycles, and reduced GHG. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-2020-thyssenkrupp-elevators-max-predictive-maintenance-solution-further-established-itself-as-the-industrys-most-transformative-service-technology-301193766.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thyssenkrupp</a>, one of the world’s leading elevator manufacturers, installed a cloud-based predictive maintenance system on 130,000 of its elevators worldwide. Its sensors collect health data of its components, systems, and performance. This helps Thyssenkrupp provide better service, extended elevator uptimes, and longer product lifespans.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Digitization can help unlock greater value across entire supply chains</strong>. Traditionally, most businesses are focused on connecting data and devices across their customer base. Digitization can be used to unlock a number of isolated parts, partners, and consumers from across the entire value chain. For instance, a raw material supplier can tap into the stocking system of a manufacturer (via APIs) to proactively validate if they are running out of certain raw materials. Once raw materials have reached end-of-life, manufacturers can leverage digital technologies to gauge whether the products have reached sufficient intrinsic value to be returned to them. This creates an opportunity for businesses to be more efficient, less resource intensive, and create less waste and emissions in the process. An increasing number of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.veltha.eu/blog/how-digital-platforms-are-enabling-circular-economy-innovation/" target="_blank">digital platforms</a> are promising to create tighter value-chain integrations and assist various manufacturers in transitioning to a circular economy model. On the consumer end, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/sustainable-retail-tech-circular-economy/" target="_blank">digital marketplaces</a> are helping to create more sustainability-conscious consumers.</p>



<p>3. <strong>Digital supply chains need to be reliable and secure</strong>. Supply chain digitization offers the promise of greater speed, efficiency, visibility, and control. However, the increased prevalence of APIs means that an organization’s attack surface increases. In the same way that a single container ship trapped in the Suez Canal can interrupt the world economy, an API that is unavailable or untrustworthy can disrupt important supply chain processes. As organizations digitize, they need to take the measures necessary to protect their digital assets.</p>



<h3><strong>How Citrix is engaging the circular economy</strong></h3>



<p>Citrix technologies empower individuals and businesses to work from anywhere and embrace adaptable work models. These technologies allow organizations to embrace a secure hybrid work model. This also means that organizations using Citrix can dramatically reduce commuting emissions while meeting employee needs for flexibility, given how <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/reducing-your-carbon-footprint-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27%</a> of U.S. emissions derive from transportation sources and office-related commuting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workers using Citrix solutions can use low-energy devices and use those same devices for longer, reducing cost and emissions while keeping hazardous waste out of landfills. This supports two key principles of a circular economy with device reuse and waste reduction.</p>



<p>Citrix technologies also play a vital role in facilitating a seamless move to energy efficiency and lower carbon cloud computing. Citrix’s App Delivery and Security solution protects and scales APIs that are so vital to a streamlined and efficient digital supply chain. Protecting the digital backbone is an important step in moving to a more circular economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shift to the circular economy will not be easy, but it will be rewarding. Customers are looking for businesses that provide great service, but also share their core values. Companies that leverage digitization to embrace circularity will be seen as visionary, and as such will be rewarded with deeper customer relationships and loyalty. As the old saying goes, what goes around, comes around.</p>

<h2><strong>Shanghai’s lockdown is giving China’s online grocery apps a second chance</strong></h2>



<p>During Shanghai’s ongoing month-long lockdown, online grocery apps have been a lifeline for residents unable to leave their homes.

<p>Midnight, 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 8:30 a.m., 9 a.m.: these times are ingrained in Queeny Song’s mind. For over a week in April, the 24-year-old Shanghai resident had to get her phone out at these five points every day to refresh a different grocery delivery app in hopes of grabbing a hard-to-get delivery slot.</p>



<p>During Shanghai’s ongoing month-long lockdown, these online grocery apps have been a lifeline for stranded residents. Song says that about 60 to 70% of her groceries have been purchased through online apps since the lockdown began. Without them, she would have run out of food.</p>



<p>The Shanghai lockdown is the latest stage of a two-year roller-coaster ride for the online grocery industry in China. Its rise and fall and rise again has mirrored the tightening and loosening of China’s covid-19 restrictions: apps like Dingdong, Alibaba’s Hema, and Meituan’s Maicai have struggled whenever lockdowns are relaxed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as China continues with its zero-covid strategy, the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/24/1051073/wechat-shanghai-lockdown-protest-video-the-voice-of-april/">harsh lockdown measures</a> have given the industry another chance to shine after a year of disappointing business returns. Whether it continues to succeed when things are back to normal is another question.</p>



<h3>The rise and fall of online grocers</h3>



<p>Around 2015, Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba, started experimenting with ideas to incorporate grocery shopping into the country’s thriving e-commerce landscape. It wasn’t until 2018 and 2019 that the industry really began to take off, with dozens of new startups competing for attention and investments. But growth was modest; startup failures were common.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was the first nationwide lockdown in China, in the first few months of 2020, that really supercharged the industry’s growth. As Chinese people first began to grapple with what it meant to be sheltering in place, they relied on these apps, most of which launched in 2018 and 2019, to have their supplies delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It soon grew into one of the hottest new tech industries in China, with venture capital funding pouring in and tech giants like DiDi and Meituan eager to take a slice. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/what-can-we-expect-in-china-in-2021">February 2021 McKinsey report</a> predicted that “online grocery shopping will likely be one of the most contested and contentious consumer facing sectors in China in 2021.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And contested it was, as players in the market were not afraid to spend: according to an anonymous executive at the now-defunct Chengxin Youxuan, the e-grocer arm of DiDi, quoted in the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/In-depth-The-shakeout-in-China-s-community-group-buying-market">Chinese business publication</a> Caixin, “The entire market was burning at least 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) every month.” In June 2021, startups Dingdong and MissFresh filed to go public in the United States on the same day, racing to be the first Chinese publicly traded online grocery company.</p>





<p>But things started to take a downturn last year. Despite the hype and money, these companies struggled to make a profit as lockdowns eased and people simply went back to shopping in person. What’s worse, they were caught in China’s new fight against antitrust behavior. The Chinese government was quick to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3123894/community-group-buying-chinese-regulators-fine-businesses-tied-big-tech">impose fines</a> and <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/12/22/consumers-love-cheap-groceries-but-can-community-group-buying-withstand-government-scrutiny/">pen editorials</a> questioning the value of the industry.</p>



<p>As a result, the once-promising startups and big tech companies decided to cut back on their expansion plans, implement massive layoffs, or outright file for bankruptcy. DiDi and Ele.me, two successful tech companies that bet on online grocery as their new growth driver, decided to shut down those services. At least two more online grocery startups have closed their businesses in the last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest lockdowns are giving the industry a second chance. With other Chinese cities like Beijing and Hangzhou also facing imminent lockdowns, millions of people are once again downloading these apps and relying on them on a daily basis. In fact, Dingdong’s app rose to third place in the App Store’s free app chart in China in the beginning of April.</p>



<h3>The daily battle</h3>



<p>While the luckier Shanghai residents may receive one-off free grocery packages from their employers or local governments, most people, like Song, needed to figure out a way to buy their own groceries. Some residents <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/shanghai-lockdown-wechat-group-buying/">formed neighborhood groups through messaging apps</a>, collecting everyone’s order and bulk-buying directly from nearby farms or food factories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Song soon realized that buying groceries with all her neighbors means she didn’t get to make her own choices. She lives in an older residential neighborhood where over three-fourths of the people are seniors or families with children. While her neighbors are placing family-size orders for things like five pounds of pork, such purchases would take her forever to consume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only other option for her, then, is the grocery apps. She frantically refreshes Dingdong, Hema, and Meituan Maicai every day to get a slot.</p>



<p>But with the lockdown interrupting the supply chain for many goods, including groceries, even placing an order on those apps requires luck and dedication. Like Black Friday shoppers waiting to bust the store doors open, Shanghai residents are swarming onto the apps at the designated time to try to buy as much as they can before the stocks run out in seconds. It can be stressful and frustrating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li, a consultant in Shanghai who’s only using her surname because she wishes to stay anonymous, also got up early every morning for a week to try her luck with half a dozen different apps. But during the lockdown, she didn’t secure one successful order, while her mother, living under the same roof, managed to get three. There was one time when Li put hundreds of RMB worth of groceries into the shopping cart—yet when she came to the payment stage, the only thing left in stock was a bag of candies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Because of the explosive increase in Shanghai users’ demand, the purchase experience will certainly be different from how it was in ordinary times. The success rate for placing orders will be low,” the grocery app Dingdong said in an emailed response to MIT Technology Review. “In this situation, our product principle is to prioritize impartiality.” The company says that’s why it restocks at the same time every day and approves a random portion of the orders each time.</p>



<p>How the industry deals with these issues may determine what it looks like when life goes back to normal. Can it retain these new consumers once people are able to go to their nearby grocery stores again? It’s hard to say, but investors are no longer as optimistic as they were in 2020, and users are likely split.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Song says she will keep apps like Dingdong and JD on her phone, because she’s thankful that they have kept her and other people fed during a scary time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li, the other Shanghai resident, thinks differently. “It is still my second choice. I’m only shopping on them because I can’t in any other way,” she says. “After the pandemic, I’m sure I won’t use them anymore.”</p>
