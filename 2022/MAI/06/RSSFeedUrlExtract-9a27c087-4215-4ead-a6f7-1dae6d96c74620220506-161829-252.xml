<p>Using this feature means that users only need to remember one password in order to manage each of their logins that they use on a daily basis, including streaming sites, email, and online banking.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN Keys uses zero-knowledge encryption, meaning that only users have access to their own logins. Their logins are only decrypted on a device when they unlock the password manager using their primary password or biometrics.</p>
<p>The feature is currently available in beta as a Chrome extension on users’ computers and built into the ExpressVPN Android mobile app. The beta version of ExpressVPN Keys for iOS is still in development, however. This password manager syncs users’ logins across all available platforms.</p>
<p><strong>ExpressVPN Keys is included in a user’s ExpressVPN subscription at no extra cost. It’s still even free to use after a user’s VPN subscriptions expire. </strong></p>
<p>Unlike some other password managers, there’s also no limit to the number of logins that users can save in ExpressVPN Keys or devices they can use it on.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Sercan Oyuntur and several co-conspirators targeted a corporation in 2018 that had a contract with the DoD to supply jet fuel to troops in southeast Asia.</p>
<p>They specifically targeted employees who were responsible for communicating with the federal government.</p>
<p>“Through a complex phishing scheme, Oyuntur and criminal conspirators in Germany, Turkey, and New Jersey targeted the corporation and the individual so that the conspirators could steal money that DoD intended to pay to the corporation for providing jet fuel,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/california-man-found-guilty-conspiracy-steal-payments-us-department-defense-bank-fraud" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">said the US Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> in a press release on April 29.</p>
<p>In order to pull off this scheme, Oyuntur and his associates created fake email accounts and designed fraudulent web pages to deceive the fuel supplier’s employees into believing they were communicating with the General Services Administration’s (GSA) public-facing website.</p>
<p>“These emails appeared to be legitimate communications from the United States government, but were actually sent by the conspirators, and contained electronic links that automatically took individuals to the phishing pages,” added the DOJ. “There, they saw what appeared to be a GSA website and were prompted to enter their confidential login credentials, which were then used by the conspirators to make changes in the government systems and ultimately divert money to the conspirators.”</p>
<p><strong>Based on the fraudulent activities of Oyuntur and his associates, on Oct. 10, 2018, the DoD transferred $23.5 million into accounts controlled by the cybercriminals.</strong></p>
<p>Oyuntur was convicted on April 28 of one count of conspiracy to commit wire, mail and bank fraud; two counts of bank fraud; one count of using an unauthorized access device to commit fraud; one count of aggravated identity theft; and one count of making false statements to federal law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>The conspiracy and bank fraud charges each carry a maximum potential prison sentence of 30 years.</p>

<p>EKZ <a href="https://www.ekz.de/faqs.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">said</a> in an FAQ on its website on Tuesday that it’s trying to fix the damage caused by the attack and to see if any personal data was stolen.</p>
<p>At the moment, however, orders cannot be made online. Orders submitted via email, fax, or telephone also cannot be completed currently.</p>
<p>Onleihe, a popular app that connects users via EKZ&#8217;s service to their local libraries to borrow eBooks and audiobooks, <a href="https://hilfe.onleihe.de/category/cn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">reported</a> on Tuesday that its copy-protected eBooks had been deleted in what it called a “process error.” Onleihe said that these eBooks would need to be re-encrypted and that it has made “incremental progress” in uploading them once more.</p>
<p>Additionally, Onleihe apologized that its user forum was currently unavailable, and said it aims to make it accessible again &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>According to reports, Lockbit ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for the attack. Lockbit also claimed on its leak site on the dark web to have published stolen data from EKZ.</strong> This is presumably due to the fact that its ransom demands have not yet been met.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies in Germany have been informed of the attack and security breach on EKZ.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cryptocurrency-300x200.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-78" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">announced</a> in a press release on Tuesday that it will almost double the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit in order to combat cryptocurrency fraud and protect investors from “cyber-related threats.”</strong></p>
<p>The SEC said it will add an extra 20 positions to the cyber team (including supervisors, investigative staff attorneys, trial counsels, and fraud analysts) to increase it to 50 employees focused on fighting crypto-based cybercrime.</p>
<p>“By nearly doubling the size of this key unit, the SEC will be better equipped to police wrongdoing in the crypto markets while continuing to identify disclosure and controls issues with respect to cybersecurity,” SEC Chair Gary Gensle said in the press release.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-176" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">inception in 2017</a>, the SEC Enforcement Division&#8217;s cyber team has fought against and investigated cyber threats targeting retail investors (individuals investing in securities through third parties like brokerage firms).</p>
<p>Up to this point, SEC’s cryptocurrency authorities have “brought more than 80 enforcement actions related to fraudulent and unregistered crypto-asset offerings and platforms, resulting in monetary relief totaling more than $2 billion.”</p>
<p><strong>The expanded cybercrime unit will protect users investigating in crypto markets by investigating securities law violations connected to crypto exchanges and multiple crypto products, including <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/how-to-stay-safe-when-buying-and-selling-nfts/" target="_blank">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and stablecoins.</strong></p>
<p>The SEC cyber team can also take action against public companies and SEC registrants who fail to report cybersecurity incidents and maintain proper cybersecurity defenses against them.</p>
<p>“The bolstered Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit will be at the forefront of protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets in the face of these critical challenges,” added Gurbir S. Grewal, the Director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SEC recently proposed rule amendments requiring publicly traded companies to report data breaches and cybersecurity incidents within four business days “after they&#8217;re determined as being a material incident.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CANONIC-300x196.png" alt=""></p><p><strong><em>With many thanks to Boris Gorin, Canonic Security&#8217;s CEO and Co-Founder, Aviva Zacks of Safety Detectives found out why his company focuses on SaaS with its AppTotal.</em></strong></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><b>Safety Detectives: What motivated you to start Canonic Security?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><strong>Boris Gorin:</strong> From my significant background in SaaS security, I started to see gaps in security and recognized that while SaaS adoption continued to exponentially grow, our industry was not addressing the security challenges that came along with the modernized digitally transformed SaaS-native security platforms. Traditional security solutions were not designed to protect SaaS-native security platforms and because of this, vulnerabilities were increasing for those infrastructures not paying close attention to the interactions between processes, platform integrations, and API calls. It became clear that our industry needed more visibility into data so that security and governance teams could have a complete view of any vulnerabilities in their infrastructure among thousands of dynamically changing apps.</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><b>SD: What do you love about working in cybersecurity?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><strong>BG:</strong> Cybersecurity has always been driven by a tightly-knit community of innovators. Inevitably, the nature of innovation pushes our community to create a home-grown toolset to get the job done. I tend to focus on helping the cybersecurity community do the best job that we can together. In the context of <a href="https://www.canonic.security/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">Canonic Security</a>, SaaS app security is a case in point. We believe that is where the low-hanging fruit lies—for the attackers first and foremost. I’ve been in cybersecurity long enough to understand that any attack vector interesting to actual attackers and white hat Red Teams will trickle down throughout the enterprise. We see that dynamic playing out in the domain of SaaS security as well.</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><b>SD: What is Canonic Security’s flagship product?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><strong>BG:</strong> AppTotal is the industry’s first publicly available community offering that automatically assesses the risks involved with OAuth apps. It essentially builds on Canonic Security’s app sandboxing technology, and dynamically scans SaaS add-ons for vulnerabilities and suspicious or malicious behavior.</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">AppTotal lets organizations profile third-party apps&#8217; permissions and access, posture, and behavior before connecting them to IT-approved applications. It is the first independent and continuously updated SaaS add-ons and integrations index, starting with Google Workspace, Microsoft 365/Azure, and Slack, with Atlassian, Salesforce, and others coming soon.</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">With AppTotal, anyone can:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">Assess the risks involved with third-party apps before granting them access to your environment</li>
<li class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">Uncover the app and publisher behind any OAuth client ID</li>
<li class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">Analyze the behavior of third-party apps within your SaaS platform</li>
</ul>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal">It’s also a community tool, and we’d love to get reader feedback!</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><b>SD: How does Canonic Security stay competitive in a world filled with cybersecurity companies?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><strong>BG:</strong> Business continuity will continue to heavily rely on SaaS apps and low code automation as companies continue to integrate third-party APIs on top of subscription based platforms. While businesses are taking full advantage of the ease and access of interconnected apps, the resulting productivity benefits increase the risks associated with a growing attack surface. Canonic Security’s app governance platform provides full visibility over apps and API integrations with access intelligence, vulnerability insight, and the industry’s first free community application security sandbox. Canonic is redefining SaaS application security with this unique sandbox environment that provides users with quick access to simulate and vet third-party integrations—a very valuable resource for companies as they grow increasingly more dependent on interconnected SaaS apps.</p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><b>SD: How is the pandemic changing cybersecurity for the future?</b><b></b></p>
<p class="yiv8552167496MsoNormal"><strong>BG:</strong> As organizations continue to adopt remote working regardless of health risks, employees are driven to use cloud services to get the job done. That means taking a closer look at how third-party platforms share sensitive data and present new risks for companies that are not necessarily SaaS-borne. It is imperative for enterprises immersed in technological innovation driving a shift in business culture to rethink SaaS application governance so that the required checks and balances are in place when it comes to data, system, and account access. Unfortunately, many companies are just starting to realize that SaaS environments are uniquely exposed to attackers and easy to miss vulnerabilities. Accelerated by the adoption of more cloud platforms, security teams and business decision-makers alike are reimagining how to approach SaaS security in general and third-party app governance in particular.</p>

This campaign reportedly began late last month.</strong></p>
<p>Since April 27, an increasing number of victims have <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/771427/magniber-2022-ransomware-cyvpbwzfv-lpdyefulm-yyqiidt-support-topic/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">shared their stories</a> on the <i>BleepingComputer</i> forum in search of a solution. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-10-updates-infect-you-with-magniber-ransomware/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">According to reports from the publication</a>, the ransomware disguises itself as Windows 10 updates and gets distributed through fraudulent warez and crack sites.</p>
<p>The ransomware then deletes shadow volume copies and encrypts files after being run, attaching a random 8-character extension.</p>
<p>Afterward, victims are sent a ransomware note which instructs them to install the Tor browser and access a custom url address for their specific individual case.</p>
<p>The Magniber payment site instructs victims on how to negotiate and pay for their ransom payment in Bitcoin. Victims are also allowed to decrypt one file for free, in order to demonstrate the validity of Magniber’s claims.</p>
<p>“The only 1 way to decrypt your files is to receive the private key and decryption program,” the ransom note reads. “Any attempts to restore your files with the third party software will be fatal for your files!”</p>
<p><strong>Reportedly, most ransom demands have been for approximately 0.068 bitcoin (or $2,500).</strong></p>
<p>Since Magniber is considered secure, there are no weaknesses on its website that can be exploited in order to recover users’ files free of charge.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/US-Senate-300x204.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>US Senators Bob Menendez, D-N.J. and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. have called on the company behind Zelle to do more to protect consumers from money transfer scams and help get money back into their accounts.</strong></p>
<p>“This widespread fraud on money transfer apps has affected nearly 18 million Americans,” the lawmakers <a href="https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/menendez_letter_to_zelle_on_scams_and_fraud.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">wrote</a> in a letter on Tuesday to Zelle’s parent company, Early Warning Systems. “Given the rise of increasingly sophisticated scams on your platform and the widely documented difficulties consumers have faced in seeking relief from banks, we seek to understand the extent to which Zelle allows fraud to flourish and the steps your company is taking to increase consumer protection and help users recover lost funds.”</p>
<p>Early Warning Systems, LLC. is owned by seven of the U.S.’s largest banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, Capital One, PNC, Truist, and U.S. Bank.</p>
<p>Early Warning Systems told reporters that it has received the letter and “will provide a response in due course.”</p>
<p><strong>The senators said that Zelle has handled more than $490 billion in transactions in 2021, doubling its nearest competitor Venmo.</strong></p>
<p>“Alarmingly, both your company and the big banks who both own and partner with the platform have abdicated responsibility for fraudulent transactions, leaving consumers with no way to get back their funds,” the lawmakers said. “Zelle’s biggest draw — the immediacy of its transfers — also makes scams more effective and a favorite of fraudsters, as consumers have no option to cancel a transaction even moments after authorizing it.”</p>
<p>“And banks have chosen to let consumers suffer, blaming them for authorizing fraudulent transactions,” they added.</p>
<p>The senators said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the FDIC previously clarified that <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/efta.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">Regulation E</a> of the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2008/0807/08-07_attachment.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">Electronic Fund Transfer Act</a> protected victims of fraudulent money transfers, including those who were induced into transferring the money themselves. They also cited an FDIC <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/consumer-compliance-supervisory-highlights/documents/ccs-highlights-march2022.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">report</a> from March “finding that the banks and the platform were both responsible for fraudulent electronic transfers through this regulation.”</p>
<p><strong>In one case, a man <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2022/02/man-loses-2800-after-fraudster-impersonates-his-bank-heres-how-it-happened.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">lost $2,800</a> after being deceived into making a Zelle transfer after he received a text saying there were fraudulent transactions on his Wells Fargo account.</strong></p>
<p>“Hindsight being 20/20, I see how stupid this sounds now but I was following the directions from the verified bank employee and felt confident that she had my best interest in mind,” he said. “Obviously that was false.”</p>
<p>Wells Fargo ended up refunding the money, but that usually doesn’t happen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Russia-Blocks-Tor-300x167.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>The United States has offered $10 million to anyone who has information regarding the Russian military hackers who orchestrated the notorious NotPeyta cyberattack.</strong></p>
<p>NotPetya first appeared in June 2017 and was spread via a poisoned update to a Ukrainian accounts program widely used by businesses in the country.</p>
<p>Victims found their data scrambled by the ransomware as a result of this attack. One high-profile victim was Pavlo Rozenko, who at the time was the deputy prime minister of Ukraine. He <a href="https://twitter.com/RozenkoPavlo/status/879677026256510976" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">posted</a> on Twitter a photo of his PC, which was in the process of being encrypted by NotPetya.</p>
<p>However, victims of the attack were not limited to Ukraine. NotPetya targeted power plants, airports, and government computers in dozens of countries. Victims included pharmaceutical firm Merck, law firm DLA Piper, container ship operator Maersk, and British advertising company WPP.</p>
<p><strong>In its <a href="https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-russian-military-intelligence-officers-conducting-malicious-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">announcement</a> on Tuesday about the reward, US authorities revealed that NotPetya had cost American organizations around $1 billion in losses.</strong></p>
<p>“These cyber intrusions damaged the computers of hospitals and other medical facilities in the Heritage Valley Health System (Heritage Valley) in western Pennsylvania, a large U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer, and other US private sector entities,” US State Department said.</p>
<p>The six men named by the US authorities are GRU officers Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">indicted</a> the six Russian officers in October 2020 on counts of conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft.</p>
<p>The Russian military hacking group associated with the men has also been implicated in a series of cyber attacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure and government departments.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Coca-Cola-300x169.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>Russian-linked <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/can-antivirus-prevent-ransomware/" target="_blank">ransomware</a> gang Stormous claimed to breach the servers of US soft drink giant Coca-Cola in April.</strong></p>
<p>Stormous said in a post to its website on Monday that it took 161 GBs worth of data, including financial information, credentials, and other sensitive information from Coca-Cola’s servers on April 24. The threat actor is now trying to sell the collection of stolen data for a little over 1.6 Bitcoin ($64,000).</p>
<p><strong>The attack on Coca-Cola appears to have been orchestrated after Stormous took a poll on Telegram, asking followers to help choose their next victim.</strong></p>
<p>In an announcement last month, the ransomware group also pledged its full support for the Russian government after it invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The STORMOUS team has officially announced its support for the Russian governments,” the group <a href="https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1498644747316981762" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">said</a> in a message in March. “And if any party in different parts of the world decides to organize a cyberattack or cyberattacks against Russia, we will be in the right direction and will make all our efforts to abandon the supplication of the West, especially the infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The soft drink giant has not yet confirmed if the alleged ransomware attack has taken place. Although, Coca-Cola said that it is working with law enforcement and forensic teams to check out Stormous’ claims.</p>
<p>“We are aware of this matter and are investigating to determine the validity of the claim,” Coca-Cola communications vice president Scott Leith <a href="https://therecord.media/coca-cola-investigating-claims-of-hack-after-ransomware-group-hawks-stolen-data/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-btn-name="Affiliate Link">commented</a> for The Record.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://static.safetydetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/US-Charity-Exposed-Users-300x158.png" alt=""></p><h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Breastcancer.org, a world-renowned breast cancer charity, has suffered a data exposure affecting users of the organization’s website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/" target="_blank">SafetyDetectives</a> cybersecurity team found an Amazon S3 bucket owned by Breastcancer.org that was misconfigured, left publicly available without any authentication controls in place.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org’s misconfigured bucket has therefore exposed hundreds of thousands of files containing <strong>sensitive images</strong> belonging to the <strong>website’s users. </strong>In particular, a portion of these images contained detailed <strong>EXIF data</strong>, which could potentially be used to locate and harass users.</p>
<p>This exposure points toward the variety of information that can be recovered from the images we post online.</p>
<h2>Who is Breastcancer.org?</h2>
<p>Founded in 2000, Breastcancer.org is a non-profit organization with a commitment to provide the latest scientifically-backed research on breast cancer and breast health for free through its website.</p>
<p>The organization hopes to empower women to make the right decisions in life, with content that simplifies a vast corpus of complex and confusing medical information.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org’s published resources are fact-checked by a team of 70+ practicing medical professionals. Outside of the site’s guidance articles, visitors can also find medical news resources, videos, podcasts, webinars, peer-to-peer discussion boards, personalized content recommendations, and Spanish-language resources.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org is based in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, in the United States, and receives over 28 million web visitors every year according to its website. Throughout its history, Breastcancer.org has reached 220,000 registered members and 174 million people across the world.</p>
<h2>What was Exposed?</h2>
<p>Breastcancer.org’s unsecured bucket exposed over 350,000 files, totaling around 150 GB of data. The bucket exposed the <strong>sensitive images </strong>of Breastcancer.org’s <strong>website users.</strong></p>
<p>There were two separate datasets exposed on Breastcancer.org’s bucket:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User avatars</strong></li>
<li><strong>Post images</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>User Avatars</h3>
<p><strong>User avatars </strong>are profile pictures taken from the accounts of Breastcancer.org users. The bucket contained <strong>over 50,000 user avatars</strong>. Many of the avatars featured <strong>images of registered users.</strong></p>
<p>While this is publicly available information, user avatars could be used in conjunction with EXIF data to identify vulnerable users.</p>
<p>You can see examples of user avatars in the following images.</p>

<h3>Post Images</h3>
<p><strong>Post images </strong>were uploaded to Breastcancer.org by its users. The bucket contained<strong> over 300,000</strong> post images and <strong>EXIF data </strong>was attached to each post image. EXIF data exposes numerous details about the format of an image and the context in which it was captured.</p>
<p>EXIF data in post images included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device details, </strong>i.e. brand and model of the camera used.</li>
<li><strong>GPS location</strong> of the captured image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some post images featured <strong>sensitive content </strong>that felt as though it was intended for private viewing. For example, there were results from medical tests and images of nudity (most likely taken for medical purposes) included among the files — contents that a user would not typically post publicly.</p>
<p>We decided to test whether post images were uploaded from public posts or private messages. We created two breastcancer.org accounts and sent an image from one account to the other. The image we sent later appeared in the bucket, confirming our suspicion that private images were exposed.</p>
<p>You can see evidence of post images below.</p>

<p>Breastcancer.org’s open bucket was live and being updated at the time of discovery.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Amazon doesn’t manage Breastcancer.org’s bucket and this misconfiguration is not Amazon’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org reaches users around the world and we’d expect there are a significant number of American and European users with images on the bucket.</p>
<p>The Breastcancer.org website suggests it has over 200,000 registered users, though, it seems unlikely that all of these users are exposed based on the bucket’s files. There are over 50,000 user avatars on the bucket, so 50,000 should stand as a minimum estimate of the number of users exposed.</p>
<p>The number of exposed people could be higher, however, considering that users could be exposed in post images even if their user avatar is not included on the bucket.</p>
<p>You can see a full breakdown of Breastcancer.org’s data exposure in the table below.</p>

<p>We discovered Breastcancer.org’s unsecured bucket on November 11th, 2021. It contained files dating back to April 2017, though, filenames suggest some of these images date back to 2014 and were migrated to the bucket in 2017. We saw recent files on the bucket, too, dated mid-November 2021. This suggests the bucket was still in use when we found it.</p>
<p>On November 17th, 2021, we messaged breastcancer.org regarding its data exposure. We sent another message to both newly-found and previously-contacted people from the organization on November 21st, 2021. We didn’t receive a reply and on December 14th, 2021, we sent further messages to AWS, the US Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), and additional breastcancer.org employees regarding this data exposure.</p>
<p>We found the bucket secured on May 4th, 2022.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org and its users could experience various impacts as a result of this incident.</p>
<h2>Data Exposure Impact</h2>
<p>We cannot and do not know whether malicious actors accessed the content of Breastcancer.org’s S3 bucket. With no security controls in place, hackers and cybercriminals could have read or downloaded the bucket’s images. This data could be used to subject users to criminal activities.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org may also face legal implications for the status of its AWS S3 bucket.</p>
<h3>Impact on Users</h3>
<p>Exposed Breastcancer.org users could experience forms of<strong> harassment </strong>if hackers accessed the bucket’s data.</p>
<p>There are no contact details belonging to users exposed on the open bucket. However, cybercriminals could target EXIF data to identify users. A picture of a person’s house, for example, could be used to locate that person if geolocation data is attached.</p>
<p>Malicious actors could identify vulnerable users to launch vicious and spiteful attacks against them. Hackers could reference a person’s medical condition or nude images to berate them with hurtful comments. With GPS locations exposed on the server, online harassment could spill over into the real world.</p>
<h3>Impact on Breastcancer.org</h3>
<p>Breastcancer.org may be investigated by data protection authorities in several jurisdictions for exposing users’ data. It’s more than likely Breastcancer.org has users from nations around the world exposed on the bucket. However, we won’t check the location data of exposed photos for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>Breastcancer.org could come under the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if the organization has mishandled the data of US citizens. The FTC protects consumers from unfair or deceptive business acts or practices. Any breach of the FTC Act could land Breastcancer.org with a maximum penalty of US$100 million or the imprisonment of guilty individuals in severe cases.</p>
<h2>Preventing Data Exposure</h2>
<p>What steps can users take to mitigate the risk of data exposure and cybercrime?</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to prevent data exposure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only provide your personal information to companies, organizations, and entities that you trust 100%.</li>
<li>Only visit websites with a secure domain name (i.e. websites that have a “https” and/or closed lock symbol at the beginning of their name).</li>
<li>Be especially vigilant when providing your most sensitive forms of data, such as your social security number.</li>
<li>Create super-strong passwords that use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and update these passwords regularly.</li>
