The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine," the newspaper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/us/politics/russia-generals-killed-ukraine.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">reported</a>. "The administration has sought to keep much of the battlefield intelligence secret, out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war."<span></span></p><p>Both classified and commercial satellites have been part of the intelligence gathering operation.</p><p>"The Biden administration is also supplying new weaponry that should improve Ukraine’s ability to target senior Russian officers. The smaller version of the Switchblade drone, which is now arriving on the battlefield, can be used to identify and kill individual soldiers, and could take out a general sitting in a vehicle or giving orders on a front line," the newspaper reported. "Although the administration remains wary of inflaming Mr. Putin to the point that he further escalates his attacks — President Biden has said he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a 'no-fly zone' there — current and former officials said the White House finds some value in warning Russia that Ukraine has the weight of the United States and NATO behind it."</p><p><u>REVEALED: </u><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/russia-ukraine-putin/" target="_self"><u>Top US general reveals the 'worst thing the Russians did' before the Ukraine invasion </u></a></p><p>Russian generals still fighting the war have grown "<a href="https://www.rawstory.com/russian-generals-increasingly-frustrated-as-they-fail-all-of-putin-s-strategic-objectives-cnn-military-analyst/" target="_blank">extremely frustrated</a>" </p><p>Frederick B.

Gen. Joseph E. Hilbert, the commanding general in charge of joint training exercises between U.S. and Ukrainian troops in Germany, revealed what he believed is "the worst thing the Russians did" that ensured they would struggle to seize control in their invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Specifically, Hilbert argued, the problem is that Russia telegraphed its intentions early — giving Ukraine "eight years to prepare" for the attack.</p><p>"Hilbert, the commanding general for the 7th Army Training Command, also said Ukraine has participated in more than a dozen large exercises with U.S. troops in Germany since 2015," reported Greg Norman and Liz Friden. "'The Ukrainian soldiers are motivated, they are professional,' Hilbert added, noting that the U.S. is currently training 50 to 60 Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate M777 howitzer artillery in Grafenwoehr, Germany."</p><p>"Hilbert also said the U.S. has trained more than 23,000 members of Ukraine's armed forces from 17 different battalions and 11 different brigades, spending a total of $126 million on this program," said the report. "He added that the U.S. was planning for Ukrainian troops to lead a division-level exercise across the country before over 160 Florida National Guard troops pulled out of Ukraine in February, days before the invasion began."</p><p><u><em><strong>RELATED: </strong><strong></strong></em></u><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/vladimir-putin-doesnt-realize-how-badly-the-ukraine-war-is-going-for-russian-forces-us-official/" target="_self"><u><em><strong>Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize how ‘badly’ the Ukraine war is going for Russian forces: US official </strong></em></u></a> </p><p>The invasion of Ukraine was launched on the pretense of Russia providing security to two so-called "independent republics" declared in the east of Ukraine by separatist rebels backed by the Kremlin.</p><p>Military experts initially feared that the capital city of Kyiv would fall fairly quickly.

<p>"We regularly re-evaluate our talent pipeline according to our business needs and in light of the expense guidance given for this earnings period, we are slowing its growth accordingly," a Meta spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>Business Insider, citing an internal note to employees, reported that the company was lowering hiring targets and had temporarily stopped hiring for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>Meta Platforms last week recorded its slowest revenue growth in a decade, with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg also saying the company would scale back costs.</p>

<p>"The goal of every Ukrainian is the restoration of territorial integrity within international borders," Zelensky said during an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal, according to a statement. "We will not enter into a frozen conflict."</p>
<p>He said Russian troops would have to withdraw and that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to agree to a ceasefire "if possible, publicly."</p>
<p>This is the prerequisite for a peace agreement, he said, although he conceded that restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity would be "difficult," especially concerning Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.</p>

In March, he was wounded in battle against Russian troops in the strategic city of Mariupol. Since then, there's been silence.</p><p>For eight years, Sasha has fought with Ukraine's Azov regiment -- a far-right volunteer battalion turned Ukrainian national guard unit renowned for the mettle of its fighters and links to extremists.</p><p>"He chose to defend his country. And no one can fault him for doing so," Ocheretna told AFP in the Ukrainian capital.</p><p>The regiment has long been fodder for Russian President Vladimir Putin during his lengthy rants against Kyiv and repeated vows to rid Ukraine of Nazis.</p><p>But in Ukraine, the Azov regiment has largely enjoyed a solid reputation and been showered with praise for its years-long commitment to fight Russian incursions into the country.</p><p>This week, demonstrators gathered in Kyiv to rally public support for Azov and their fellow defenders of Mariupol, as the Russians launched another withering assault on a sprawling steel plant where Ukrainian forces in the southern city are taking a final stand.</p><p>Many of the participants had family and friends in the Azov Regiment, with some brandishing its yellow and blue flag featuring the infamous "Wolfsangel" logo that draws a striking similarity to insignia used by German Nazi SS units in World War II.</p><p>But despite criticism mostly from abroad of the regiment, Azov's backers in Ukraine insist that their forces are fighting fascists, not supporting them.</p><p>"If they had radical beliefs, they would have been pushed out of the army. I don't see any far-right radicalism or extremism in them," said Taras Tokovyi, a 32-year-old entrepreneur in Kyiv.</p><p>"They are simply Ukrainian heroes," he added.</p><p>Mariupol resident Svitlana Mitroshchenko agreed, citing the vital support -- including food and supplies -- Azov fighters provided to civilians in the war-torn port city following the Russian invasion.</p><h2>'Get out alive'</h2><p>"If not for these Azov guys, this would probably have been another Bucha," said Mitroshchenko, 47, fighting back tears as she referred to the Kyiv suburb where Ukraine and the West have accused Moscow's forces of killing civilians.</p><p>"It's the Russians who should really be called Nazis," she added.</p><p>Azov rose to prominence when it took up arms to beat back pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas in 2014, when Ukraine was in disarray following Moscow's lightning capture and later annexation of the Crimean peninsula.</p><p>Its founding members embraced a host of neo-Nazi symbols while maintaining links to a network of far-right movements before watering down its hard-line ideology and falling under the command of the Ukrainian military.</p><p>"The Azov Regiment is part of the national guard of Ukraine, it is not an independent paramilitary unit anymore. The connection with right-wing, radical politicians remains in history," said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst.</p><p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Azov's defence of Mariupol -- where their fighters and Ukrainian military units remain outgunned and outnumbered by Russian forces -- has only crystalised their popularity, giving them a status reserved for the bravest of the brave.</p><p>"They have big hearts for standing up in such a difficult situation," said Khrystyna Shemchuk, 21.</p><p>"Only a person with a big heart can stay there and fight in such conditions -- probably staying there to die."</p><p>But for 51-year-old Svitlana Prypyshna whose son is an Azov soldier based in Mariupol, the survival of the regiment's remaining forces is what matters most.</p><p>"My heart is breaking apart. My soul is crying out. But I cannot do anything about it," said Prypyshna.</p><p>"Of course, I feel proud, but I hope they get out alive."</p>]]></description>

<p>Kishida's government was accused by the Russian Foreign Ministry of launching an "unprecedented anti-Russian campaign" and "allowing itself to use improper rhetoric against the Russian Federation, including slander and direct threats."</p>
<p>Tokyo's actions are destroying "good neighbourly relations" and damaging Russia's economy and image, it added.</p>
<p>In addition to the Japanese prime minister, Russia's blacklist includes Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, parliamentarians, owners of media outlets and journalists.</p>
<p>The entry ban is in effect indefinitely.</p>
<p>Japan joined Western partners in slapping sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. But tensions between two countries have also flared due to competing claims to the Kuril Islands, which Tokyo calls its Northern Territories.</p>
<p>Moscow terminated talks on a partial return of the archipelago in March. Tokyo subsequently described these islands as "illegally occupied" in April for the first time in years.</p>

<p>SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's office workers and factory labourers have been dispatched to farming areas around the country to join a fight against drought, state media reported on Wednesday, amid concerns over prolonged food shortages.</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had called for measures to improve a tense food situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic and typhoons, despite slight improvements early last year.</p>
<p>Drought and floods have long posed a seasonal threat to North Korea, which lacks irrigation systems and other infrastructure, and any serious natural hazards could cripple its reclusive economy already reeling from international sanctions and a near halt of trade.</p>
<p>The North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said government officials and company and factory workers joined hands with farmers nationwide in distributing pumping equipment and developing water resources in drought-prone regions.</p>
<p>It did not specify any damages so far, but said those efforts are aimed at countering an ongoing dry spell and bracing for an upcoming drought.</p>
<p>"Systematic, aggressive efforts are under way to raise public awareness and mobilise all available capabilities to prevent crop damages from drought in advance," the paper said.</p>
<p>North Korea's weather authorities on Tuesday warned of prolonged dry weather across the country until early next week, according to the official KCNA news agency.</p>
<p>The weather agency said last week that the average temperature for April was 2.3 Celsius (36.1 Fahrenheit) degrees higher than usual, with just 44 percent of its average rainfall nationwide.</p>
<p>In Anju and Kaechon, north of the capital Pyongyang, people created ponds, added fertiliser and growth enhancer to crops, and sent tractors, trucks and cultivators to carry water to farms, Rodong said.</p>
<p>Another dispatch said young labour units, which are called dolgyeokdae or youth brigades and usually mobilised in major infrastructure projects, have recently built waterways in the eastern port city of Hamhung as part of efforts to modernise and expand irrigational facilities.</p>
<p>In March, the United Nations urged Pyongyang to reopen its borders to aid workers and food imports, saying its deepening isolation may have left many facing starvation.</p>
<p>North Korea has not officially confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but it had closed borders and travel restrictions, before briefly resuming trade with China early this year.</p>
<p>The World Food Program estimated that even before the pandemic hit, 11 million, or more than 40 percent of the population, were undernourished and required humanitarian assistance.</p>

      <title>Pope wants to visit Moscow to meet Putin over Ukraine: report</title>

<p>VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis said in an interview published on Tuesday that he asked for a meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to stop the war in Ukraine but had not received a reply.</p>
<p>The pope also told Italy's Corriere Della Sera newspaper that Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, who has given the war his full-throated backing, "cannot become Putin's altar boy".</p>
<p>Francis, who made an unprecedented visit to the Russian embassy when the war started, told the newspaper that about three weeks into the conflict, he asked the Vatican's top diplomat to send a message to Putin.</p>
<p>The message was "that I was willing to go to Moscow. Certainly, it was necessary for the Kremlin leader to allow an opening. We have not yet received a response and we are still insisting".</p>
<p>"I fear that Putin cannot, and does not, want to have this meeting at this time. But how can you not stop so much brutality? Twenty-five years ago in Rwanda we lived through the same thing," he was quoted as saying, appearing to equate the killings in Ukraine to the genocide in the African country in 1994.</p>
<p>Before the interview, Francis, 85, had not specifically mentioned Russia or Putin publicly since the start of the conflict on Feb. 24. But he has left little doubt which side he has criticised, using terms such as unjustified aggression and invasion and lamenting atrocities against civilians.</p>
<p>The pope said that perhaps Putin reacted because of "NATO's barking at Russia's gate .. I wouldn't know if this provoked an ire but perhaps it facilitated it".</p>
<p>Asked about a trip to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, which Francis last month said was a possibility, the pope said he would not go for now.</p>
<p>"First, I have to go to Moscow, first I have to meet Putin ... I do what I can. If Putin would only open a door," he said.</p>
<p>STRAINED RELATIONS</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine has strained relations between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church, and caused a split among Orthodox Christians around the world.</p>
<p>Reuters reported on April 11 that the Vatican was considering extending the pope's trip to Lebanon on June 12-13 by a day so he could meet with Kirill on June 14 in Jerusalem. But Francis later decided against it.</p>
<p>In the interview, Francis said that when he had a 40-minute video conference with Kirill on March 16, the patriarch spent half of it reading from a sheet of paper "with all the justifications for the war".</p>
<p>Moscow describes its action in Ukraine as a "special operation" to demilitarise and "denazify" its neighbour. Kirill, 75, sees the war as a bulwark against a West he considers decadent, particularly over the acceptance of homosexuality.</p>
<p>"We (the pope and Kirill) are pastors of the same people of God. That is why we have to seek paths of peace, to cease the fire of weapons. The patriarch cannot become Putin's altar boy," Francis was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The pope also said that when he met Viktor Orban on April 21, the Hungarian prime minister told him "the Russians have a plan, that everything will end on May 9", referring to the anniversary of Russia's liberation at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said the anniversary would have no bearing on Moscow's military operations in Ukraine.</p>

<p>TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister affirmed on Tuesday their support of women's right to choose after a leaked draft ruling suggests the United States Supreme Court is prepared to strike down a landmark decision legalizing abortion.</p>
<p>The Bloc Quebecois, a federal political party, also moved a motion in Canada's Parliament Tuesday to recognize a woman's "free choice in the matter of abortion."</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she was "both shocked and deeply troubled" by the leaked ruling and said her government has a "clear and determined commitment" to protect a woman's right to choose.</p>
<p>"We'll never back down from protecting and promoting women's rights in Canada and around the world," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a tweet.</p>
<p>Canada's Supreme Court decriminalized abortion in a historic 1988 ruling. Ostensibly, since then, abortion has been a medical procedure like any other. But barriers to access persist, especially for people living outside urban areas.</p>
<p>Canada's top court is unlikely to re-criminalize abortion any time soon but if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade that could embolden anti-abortion movements and galvanize abortion activists, Canadian observers and advocates both for and against abortion told Reuters.</p>
<p>The U.S. ruling, which is not due until June, will "definitely give juice to the anti-abortion forces," said Judy Rebick, who has been fighting for abortion access in Canada since doctor Henry Morgentaler defied the ban in the 1980s.</p>
<p>But Rebick said abortion opponents face more of an uphill battle in Canada, where activists built community support decades ago.</p>
<p>"You have a huge pro-choice majority which has mobilized time and time again."</p>
<p>Jack Fonseca, director of political operations for the anti-abortion Campaign Life Coalition, predicted a "pro-life blossoming" if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, with people looking to make changes south of the border a reality in Canada.</p>
<p>While Canadian abortion opponents wait for an anti-abortion political sea change, Fonseca said, his group may push for interim measures such as a de-listing of abortion from health services provinces cover.</p>
<p>Canada is unlikely to see a similar rollback of abortion access on a national level, said political scientist Emmett Macfarlane, as the top court is less polarized and partisan than the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>"What I'll be watching for is, who does this mobilize? Does this mobilize the anti-choice movement in Canada, and are the pro-choice majority complacent? Or does it raise the hackles of the pro-choice majority?"</p>
<p>Carolyn Egan's phone was ringing Tuesday morning with "outraged" people "wanting to do something," said the longtime abortion activist and organizer with Ontario Coalition for Abortion Clinics.</p>
<p>"It's really raising a clarion call here."</p>

<img src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=29754149&width=980"/><br/><br/><div class="nordot-body"><div class="nordot-image"><figure><img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ec1564e143c4f33e3a87e6c52f5ef18d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="119f6" loading="lazy" src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=29754152&width=980"/><figcaption>World map showing the different states of press freedom by countries and territories, compiled by Reporters Without Borders</figcaption></figure></div><p>London (AFP) - Unregulated online content has spread disinformation and propaganda that have amplified political divisions, fanned international tensions and even contributed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a media watchdog said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reporters Without Borders, widely known by its French acronym RSF, presented its findings in the 2022 edition of its annual World Press Freedom Index.</p>
<p>Democratic societies, it said, are increasingly fractured by social media spreading disinformation and media pursuing a "Fox News model", referring to the controversial US right-wing television network.</p>
<p>Autocratic regimes meanwhile tightly control information within their societies, using their leveraged position to wage "propaganda wars" against democracies and fuel divisions within them.</p>
<p>Such polarisation is becoming more "extreme," worldwide, RSF's director of operations and campaigns Rebecca Vincent told a news conference in London.</p>
<p>She pointed to the deaths of journalists in the Netherlands and Greece as well as the case of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who risks extradition and trial in the US for the publication of secret files.</p>
<p>The report showed how Russia, where state-run media overwhelmingly dominates and independent outlets are largely stifled, waged a propaganda war before its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Evgeniya Dillendorf, a correspondent for the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the main reason for lack of media diversity in Russia "is not pressure but lack of independent business which would finance it, and the lack of independent judicial system that would defend it".</p>
<p>Novaya Gazeta has suspended publication for the duration of Moscow's military intervention to avoid being shut down.</p>
<p>"The creation of media weaponry in authoritarian countries eliminates their citizens' right to information but is also linked to the rise in international tension, which can lead to the worst kind of wars," RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said.</p>
<p>The "Fox News-isation" of Western media also posed a "fatal danger for democracies because it undermines the basis of civil harmony and tolerant public debate", he added.</p>
<p>Deloire urged countries to adopt legal frameworks to protect democratic online information spaces.</p>
<h1>Record 'very bad'</h1>
<p>The situation is "very bad" in a record 28 countries, according to this year's ranking of 180 countries and regions.</p>
<p>The lowest ranked were North Korea (180th), Eritrea (179th) and Iran (178th), with Myanmar (176th) and China (175th) close behind.</p>
<p>Russia (155th) and its ally Belarus (153rd) were also among the most repressive.</p>
<p>Based on the previous calendar year, this does not reflect Russia's massive media crackdown since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's position plummeted dozens of places to 148th, reflecting Beijing's efforts to use "its legislative arsenal to confine its population and cut it off from the rest of the world", RSF said.</p>
<p>"It is the biggest downfall of the year, but it is fully deserved due to the consistent attacks on freedom of the press and the slow disappearance of the rule of law in Hong Kong," Cedric Alviani, head of RSF's Taiwan-based East Asia bureau, told AFP.</p>
<p>Just eight countries were ranked as "good", down from 12 last year.</p>
<p>Nordic countries Norway, Denmark and Sweden again topped the index, while the Netherlands fell from sixth to 28th after top crime reporter, Peter R. de Vries, was gunned down on an Amsterdam street last July.</p>
<p>The Free Press Unlimited group called the fall in the Netherlands "alarming news" and unprecedented, as the country had always been in the top 10 since 2002.</p>
<p>RSF commended Moldova (40th) and Bulgaria (91st) this year due to government changes and "the hope it has brought for improvement in the situation for journalists". </p>
<p>But it noted "oligarchs still own or control the media" in both.</p>
<p>Media polarisation was "feeding and reinforcing internal social divisions in democratic societies" such as the United States (42nd), it said.</p>
<p>That trend was even starker in "illiberal democracies" such as Poland (66th), a European Union country where RSF noted suppression of independent media.</p>
<p>The NGO, launched in 1985 and which has published the yearly index since 2002, has become a thorn in the side of autocratic and despotic regimes around the world.</p>
<p>This year's listing used five new indicators to define press freedom -- political context, legal framework, economic context, sociocultural context, and security -- to reflect its "complexity".</p>

"The progress in the east from the Russians has been uneven. It has been impeded, it has been slow. And they have not been able to achieve a whole lot of success there in the east. They're still bombing Mariupol. For all the claims there is no resistance in Mariupol, there is."</p><p>Kirby then explained that even Russian gains are not guaranteed to hold.</p><p><strong><u><em>RELATED: </em></u></strong><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/putin-puts-west-on-notice-moscow-can-terminate-exports-and-deals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Putin puts West on notice: Moscow can terminate exports and deals"><strong><u><em>Putin puts West on notice: Moscow can terminate exports and deals</em></u></strong></a></p><p>"They have not achieved really any of the strategic objectives that Mr. Putin set out for, and the Ukrainians are fighting back stiffly, bravely, nimbly, skillfully in the Donbas region," Kirby concluded. "There is a lot of back and forth. The Russians might take a town or two, Ukrainians will take it back. We're still continuing to see that, even over the last 24 hours."</p><p>Initially, Russian forces seemed to be attempting to take the capital city of Kyiv, in the north central area of Ukraine, only to face serious obstacles.</p><p>Russia has subsequently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/02/russia-ukraine-war-news-putin-live-updates/" target="_blank">pulled back</a> to focus on the eastern areas, where the Kremlin-backed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk initially declared so called "independent republics" that Russia used as the justification to launch a "security" mission to protect.</p><p><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-2657255351/" target="_blank"><em>Watch below or at this link</em></a><em>:</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

But to characterize her campaign as a total loss would be missing an essential point: with nearly 41.2% of the vote, a far-right contender came closer to securing the French presidency than at any point in the past.</div><p>She outperformed the previous two times that her party got through to the final round. In 2017, Le Pen received only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/may/07/french-presidential-election-results-latest">33.9% of the vote</a>. Her father and predecessor as head of the Front National – now rebranded as Rassemblement National, or National Rally – won <a href="http://www.electionresources.org/fr/president.php?election=2002">just 17.8% of the vote</a> in the 2002 runoff.</p><p>Marine Le Pen is enjoying an undeniable, upward trend in popularity.</p><h2>Chasing the youth vote</h2><p>The growth in support for France’s far right isn’t taking place in a vacuum. A wave of populist sentiment has swept across <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62855-4">much of Europe</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/532781-the-future-of-populism-in-america/">and North America</a> in the last few years. Moreover, the French and American far right have demonstrated a <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/politique/candace-owens-invitee-de-marion-marechal-macron-n-est-pas-un-leader-fort-21-09-2019-8156766.php">mutual admiration</a> and <a href="https://www.france24.com/fr/france/20220215-%C3%A9ric-zemmour-se-f%C3%A9licite-d-un-long-et-chaleureux-entretien-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9phonique-avec-donald-trump">exchange of strategies</a>. The French right’s <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/14/the-french-right-is-obsessed-with-fighting-wokeness/">fight against “wokisme”</a> echoes American conservative discourse around critical race theory. Similarly, the American right <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-pushes-racist-great-replacement-theory-yet-again-adl-renews-call-for-fox-to-fire-him">has drawn inspiration</a> from French writer Renaud Camus’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/fr/2019/09/20/world/europe/renaud-camus-grand-replacement.html">white nationalist</a> idea of a “<a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/you-will-not-replace-us">grand remplacement</a>,” which holds that white populations and culture are being replaced by non-white, non-Christian people.</p><p>But the results of the recent election show something beyond a general growth in support for the far right – something that is happening on both sides of the Atlantic. The French right is succeeding in one key demographic that the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/28/global-right-wing-authoritarian-test/">American right has seemingly failed to capture</a>: youth voters.</p><p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="frY0m" rel="border: none" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/frY0m/1/" style="border: none" width="100%"></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/fr-fr/presidentielle-2022/second-tour-profil-des-abstentionnistes-et-sociologie-des-electorats">Analysis of the presidential runoff</a> shows that 49% of 25-34 year olds who voted opted for Le Pen – compared to just over 41% of the general population, and 29% of voters over 70.</p><p>This wasn’t always the case. Like in the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/">United States</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/le-vote-jeune-existe-t-il-179871">youth voters in France</a> have historically supported progressive and left-leaning platforms. The Front National – which was established as an <a href="https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_POUV_157_0005--the-origins-of-the-national-front.htm">explicitly neo-fascist, anti-immigrant party</a>, and whose founder Jean-Marie Le Pen has been <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20210901-french-far-right-party-founder-jean-marie-le-pen-faces-new-hate-trial">repeatedly convicted</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121105195546/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93051559.html">by French courts</a> for inciting racial hatred – was especially far from youth politics.</p><p>Indeed, until recently, the French far right’s relation to the under-30 crowd could be summarized in the words of punk rock group Bérurier Noir, which <a href="https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/bretagne/il-y-a-38-ans-berurier-noir-chantait-la-jeunesse-emmerde-le-front-national-entretien-avec-loran-beru-2531640.html">famously sang</a> during a 1989 concert that “la jeunesse emmerde le Front National” – “young people piss off the Front National.” </p><p>This lyric became a rallying cry during the 2002 elections, as youth voters turned out in overwhelming numbers – both to the ballot box and <a href="https://www.20minutes.fr/diaporama/diaporama-15314-images-20-ans-jeunesse-manifestait-contre-extreme-droite-france">to the streets in protest</a> – when the far right advanced to the runoffs for the first time in the Front National’s history. </p><h2>Rebranding the right</h2><p>The tide began to change when <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2011/01/14/01002-20110114ARTFIG00673-marine-le-pen-elue-presidente-du-front-national.php">Marine Le Pen took control</a> of the Front National from her father in 2011. Over the last decade, she has undertaken a conscious process of “<a href="https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/le-reportage-de-la-redaction/du-fn-au-rn-dix-ans-de-dediabolisation">de-demonizing</a>” the party in an effort to distance itself from its <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/actualites/2017/03/15/le-front-national-face-a-ses-vieux-demons-antisemites_1555982/">antisemitic past</a>. Instead, Le Pen wants to present herself as a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210703-france-s-far-right-marine-le-pen-under-fire-for-going-mainstream">mainstream candidate</a>.</p><p>While, as <a href="https://www.20minutes.fr/elections/presidentielle/2060491-20170502-presidentielle-front-national-vraiment-change">many point out</a>, many of the policies of Rassemblement National <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2022/article/2022/03/31/presidentielle-2022-derriere-la-normalisation-de-marine-le-pen-un-projet-qui-reste-d-extreme-droite_6119942_6059010.html">aren’t substantively different</a> from their far-right roots, the party has tried to appeal to young voters by reframing its stances on issues like <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/2022-presidential-election/article/2022/04/17/le-pen-challenges-macron-s-punitive-ecology-with-her-national-ecology_5980790_16.html">the environment</a> and <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/presidentielle-marine-le-pen-et-le-feminisme-un-engagement-de-facade_2169345.html">feminism</a>. Le Pen retreated from her <a href="https://www.linternaute.com/actualite/politique/2626647-marine-le-pen-climatosceptique-l-accusation-de-macron-est-elle-fondee/">previous climate skepticism</a> and embraced a program of so-called <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2022/04/15/marine-le-pen-oppose-son-ecologie-nationale-a-l-ecologie-punitive-d-emmanuel-macron_6122325_823448.html">nationalist ecology</a>, which advocates for energy independence and French-made products. She also positioned herself as a <a href="http://www.slate.fr/story/225591/marine-le-pen-defense-animaux-chats-rassemblement-national-electorat-populaire">pro-animal welfare candidate</a> by calling for stricter regulations on the meatpacking industry, and claimed to “<a href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/tribunes/20220422.OBS57476/marine-le-pen-feministe-defendre-les-femmes-parce-qu-on-est-une-femme-est-un-leurre.html#">defend women</a>” by campaigning against street harassment.</p><p>Critics note that her animal welfare proposals amounted to a <a href="https://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/presidentielle-2022-cette-mesure-de-le-pen-qui-signifierait-l-interdiction-du-halal-et-du-casher-7900137659">ban on halal and kosher meat</a> and that her rhetoric on street harassment <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/politique/marine-le-pen-condamne-le-harcelement-de-rue-produit-de-l-immigration-selon-elle-15-01-2018-7502490.php">placed the blame on immigrant men</a> who, according to her campaign videos, either did not know or did not respect “<a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/societe/violences-faites-aux-femmes-que-proposent-les-candidats-a-l-election-presentielle">French cultural codes</a>.”</p><h2>Appealing to youth</h2><p>Beyond reframing, though, the Rassemblement National also proposed a number of concrete fiscal policies that target youth voters. In her <a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/presidentielle-voici-les-propositions-de-marine-le-pen-et-demmanuel-macron-pour-la-jeunesse-4105995">2022 presidential platform</a>, Le Pen promised to eliminate taxes for those under 30, offer financial assistance to student workers and increase housing for students.</p><p>Le Pen and the Rassemblement National haven’t convinced everyone. It remains a primarily <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/politique-societe/politique/europe-derriere-lapparent-recentrage-de-marine-le-pen-un-programme-radical-menant-au-frexit-1400170">anti-immigrant, anti-European nationalist party</a> that often faces accusations of <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/politique/laissez-les-musulmans-tranquilles-deplacement-chahute-pour-marine-le-pen-dans-le-vaucluse">Islamophobia</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2022/article/2022/04/08/marine-le-pen-se-defend-de-tout-racisme-dans-son-programme-et-denonce-les-propos-outranciers-d-emmanuel-macron_6121222_6059010.html">racism</a> and <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/190422/derriere-la-dediabolisation-de-marine-le-pen-le-veritable-danger-du-rn-pour-les-lgbti">homophobia</a>. </p><p>When Le Pen advanced to the runoffs after the first round of voting on April 10 – <a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/lecart-entre-jean-luc-melenchon-et-marine-le-pen-se-resserre-fortement-4104913">barely edging out</a> far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon – huge numbers of students turned out in protest across France, declaring that they would vote “<a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/ni-le-pen-ni-macron-le-slogan-qui-divise-les-etudiants_2172021.html">neither Macron, nor Le Pen</a>.” Many young voters in 2022 abstained from voting altogether – an estimated <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/elections/presidentielle/presidentielle-le-taux-dabstention-chez-les-jeunes-restera-eleve-au-second-tour-1400817">30%</a> of those under 35 years old in the first round, climbing to a historic <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/politique/abstention-des-jeunes-les-politiques-ne-parlent-pas-des-sujets-qui-les-preoccupent">40% in the runoff</a>. </p><h2>Declining support of GOP</h2><p>In both <a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/pourquoi-les-jeunes-ne-votent-plus-11-04-2022-2471686_3121.php">France</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-so-few-young-americans-vote-132649">U.S.</a>, younger generations express feelings of disinterest in and neglect by mainstream political institutions.</p><p>Yet young people in the U.S. continue to show <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/28/global-right-wing-authoritarian-test/">comparatively low levels of support</a> for right-wing authoritarianism. In <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2016">2016</a> and <a href="https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2020">2020</a>, voters age 18-29 were 10 points lower in their support for Donald Trump compared to the overall population.</p><p>So why aren’t we seeing the French trend in the U.S.? </p><p>It’s important to note that the U.S. Republican Party and the French Rassemblement National are not completely analogous, due at least in part to the fact that the U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/27/why-are-there-only-two-parties-in-american-politics/">is a two-party system</a>. The Republican Party is the only viable option available to right-wing voters. In France, the Rassemblement National is one of several far-right movements, and is wholly separate from the mainstream conservative Les Républicains party. </p><p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="89090" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/89090/1/" style="border: none" width="100%"></iframe></p><p>Still, the GOP and the Rassemblement National are increasingly occupying the same political space. According to the University of Gothenburg’s V-Dem Institute, the Republican Party <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/static/website/img/refs/vparty_briefing.pdf">shifted dramatically</a> towards illiberal rhetoric between 2002 and 2018, putting it in proximity to European far-right parties. Similarly, the GOP and the Rassemblement National received similar scores on Harvard University’s 2019 <a href="https://www.globalpartysurvey.org/">Global Party Survey</a> in terms of opposition to ethnic minority rights and adherence to liberal democratic principles, norms and practices. </p><p>The GOP and the RN have also demonstrated a growing, <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/actualites/2019/09/28/la-convention-de-la-droite-de-marion-marechal-le-pen-vire-a-la-caricature-radicale_1754246/">mutual recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/usa/presidentielle/donald-trump/une-delegation-du-rassemblement-national-aupres-de-l-equipe-trumpaux-etats-unis_4165547.html">exchange of ideas</a> over the last few years.</p><p>Indeed, over the last few weeks, far-right groups in France have even begun to echo U.S.-style “<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/28/election-conspiracy-theories-macron-victory-le-pen">Stop the Steal</a>” rhetoric in response to Emmanuel Macron’s vote shares.</p><p>Yet is seems unlikely that far-right segments of the Republican Party can replicate the metamorphosis that allowed Rassemblement National to appeal to youth voters.</p><p>Party structures in the U.S. are significantly more decentralized than in France. While Le Pen was able to lead the charge in “softening” her image, it’s not clear who would play that role in an American context for Republicans.

<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin put the West on notice on Tuesday that he could terminate exports and deals, the Kremlin's toughest response yet to the sanctions burden imposed by the United States and allies over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, signed a broad decree on Tuesday which forbade the export of products and raw materials to people and entities on a sanctions list that he instructed the government to draw up within 10 days.</p>
<p>The decree, which came into force with its publication, gives Moscow the power to sow chaos across markets as it could at any moment halt exports or tear up contracts with an entity or individual it has sanctioned.</p>
<p>The Russian government has 10 days to draw up lists of those it will sanction beyond the Western politicians it has already.</p>
<p>Putin explicitly framed the decree as a response to what he cast as the illegal actions of the United States and its allies meant to deprive "the Russian Federation, citizens of the Russian Federation and Russian legal entities of property rights or the restricting their property rights".</p>
<p>The decree sets out "retaliatory special economic measures in connection with the unfriendly actions of some foreign states and international organizations".</p>
<p>Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine prompted the United States and its allies to impose the most severe sanctions in modern history on Russia and Moscow's business elite, steps Putin casts as a declaration of economic war.</p>
<p>The West's attempt to economically isolate Russia - one of the world's biggest producers of natural resources - has propelled the global economy into uncharted waters with soaring prices and warnings of food shortages.</p>
<p>'ECONOMIC WAR'</p>
<p>Putin, 69, has repeatedly warned that Moscow will respond in kind, though until Tuesday the Kremlin's toughest economic response had been to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and demand a new payment scheme for European buyers of gas.</p>
<p>Tuesday's decree forbids the export of products and raw materials to people and entities that the Kremlin has sanctioned. It forbids any transactions with such people or entities - even under current contracts.</p>
<p>Putin tasked the government with drawing up the list of foreign individuals and companies to be sanctioned, as well as defining "additional criteria" for a number of transactions that could be subject to restrictions.</p>
<p>"This is a framework decree," said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie Moscow Center and founder of the R.Politik political analysis firm.</p>
<p>"Now all the specific lists should be developed by the government. That's the main thing and we need to wait for."</p>
<p>Since the West imposed sanctions on Russia, the $1.8 trillion economy has been heading for its biggest contraction since the years following the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, amid soaring inflation.</p>
<p>A significant transfer of Russian assets has begun as the Russian state gains even more influence over the economy, many major Western investors - such as energy giants BP and Shell - exit, and oligarchs try to restructure their business empires.</p>

Becoming the first Western leader to address Ukraine's parliament since the start of Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, Johnson saluted the country's bravery in exploding "the myth of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's invincibility".

<p>Russia began an invasion of Ukraine in February, arguing that it had to "de-Nazify" the country, a claim that was already widely refuted given the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov upped the ante, telling an Italian broadcaster that Zelensky's heritage did not rule out anti-Semitic leanings in the country. "That does not mean anything at all. The wise Jewish people say that the most keen anti-Semites are usually Jews," he told Italian TV channel Rete4.</p>
<p>That prompted a diplomatic backlash from Israel, with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid urging the Russian leadership on Monday to "open a history book."</p>
<p>Russia's Foreign Ministry fired back on Tuesday, calling Lapid's criticism "anti-historical," adding that basing arguments on Zelensky's Jewish heritage "not only did not hold up, but were also duplicitous."</p>
<p>Furthermore, they said that Ukraine is not only tainted by a "crazy Russophobia and a fight against anything Russian," but also anti-Semitism and anti-Romani sentiments, according to a statement.</p>
<p>An Israeli spokesperson said on Tuesday that the country's Foreign Ministry had "stated its position" during a meeting with Russian Ambassador Anatoly Viktorov the day before, but that both sides had agreed "not to elaborate further." Israeli news agency ynet reported that Israeli officials assume there will be no apology.</p>
<p>Israel has close ties to both Russia and Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke to the leaders of both countries multiple times early in the war.</p>

<img src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=29753126&width=980"/><br/><br/><div class="nordot-body"><div class="nordot-image"><figure><img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="685976e40fbb83ab2674887385fd63c5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="469e0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=29753128&width=980"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>By Joseph Campbell and Tom Balmforth</p>
<p>ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russian forces fired rockets at an encircled steel works in Ukraine's southern port city of Mariupol and thick smoke blackened the sky at the plant where officials on Tuesday said 200 civilians were trapped despite evacuations.</p>
<p>Russia's offensive to capture the east and south after failing to take the capital of Kyiv has been met with commitments by Western powers to supply heavier weapons to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the European Commission is expected to finalise a ban on buying Russian oil in an effort to squeeze Moscow's war chest.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress is considering a $33 billion military aid package, and the United Kingdom this week vowed an additional $375 million in defence assistance.</p>
<p>Reuters images showed volleys of rockets fired from a Russian truck-mounted launcher towards the sprawling Soviet-era steel complex from the outskirts of Russian-occupied Mariupol on Monday.</p>
<p>The attack followed a UN-brokered ceasefire around the complex that allowed several groups of civilians to escape Mariupol's last holdout of Ukrainian fighters in recent days. It was not immediately clear if new fighting was preventing more evacuations.</p>
<p>Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko said he hoped a first column of evacuees would reach the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday, adding that more civilians were trapped in bunkers and tunnels under the complex and some 100,000 remained in the rest of the city.</p>
<p>"You wake up in the morning and you cry. You cry in the evening. I don't know where to go at all," said Mariupol resident Tatyana Bushlanova, sitting by a blackened apartment block and talking over the sound of shells exploding nearby.</p>
<p>Mariupol is a major target for Russia as it seeks to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and connect Russian-controlled territory in the south and east.</p>
<p>Russian bombardments since troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 have flattened cities, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than five million to flee the country.</p>
<p>The war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin has shifted to the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which were already held by Russian-backed separatists.</p>
<p>Russia's troops are trying to encircle a large Ukrainian force there, attacking from three directions with massive bombardment along the front. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists.</p>
<p>Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression.</p>
<p>Western allies of Ukraine have stepped up supplies of increasingly heavy weapons. Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska asked the West to maintain its support.</p>
<p>"We ask you not to stop, to accelerate the pace of heavy weapons provision," she told British television, adding that she had not seen President Volodymyr Zelenskiy since the start of the invasion.</p>
<p>Pope Francis said in an interview published on Tuesday that he had asked for a meeting in Moscow with Putin to try to stop the war but had not received a response. French President Emmanuel Macron will speak with Putin on Tuesday, Macron's office said.</p>
<p>EU SET TO SHUN RUSSIAN OIL</p>
<p>In Brussels, the European Commission is expected to finalise a proposed sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, including a possible embargo on buying Russian oil. In a major shift, Germany said it was prepared to back an immediate oil embargo.</p>
<p>Kyiv says Russia's energy exports to Europe, so far largely exempt from international sanctions, are funding the Kremlin war effort.</p>
<p>"This package should include clear steps to block Russia's revenues from energy resources," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.</p>
<p>EU countries have paid more than 47 billion euros ($47.43 billion) to Russia for gas and oil since it invaded Ukraine, according to research organisation the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>
<p>Ambassadors from EU countries will discuss the proposed sanctions when they meet on Wednesday. Putin responded with retaliatory economic sanctions against "unfriendly" foreign states on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The pope told the newspaper that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had told him Russia planned to end the war on May 9, which Russia celebrates as "Victory Day", marking Nazi Germany's surrender in 1945.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this week that Moscow would not rush to meet that symbolic date.</p>
<p>TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION</p>
<p>Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, was under bombardment, as it has been since the early days of the invasion, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Giving an update on the battle front, Ukraine's general staff said its forces were defending the approach to Kharkiv from Izyum, a town on the Donets river, some 120 km (75 miles) to the southeast, as the enemy left a trail of destruction in Luhansk province.</p>
<p>Some other areas of Donetsk were under constant fire and regional authorities were trying to evacuate civilians from frontline areas, the Ukrainian president's office said.</p>
<p>Russian shelling killed at least three civilians in the town of Vuhledar, the president's office said. Ukraine's military said Russian forces were trying to take the frontline town of Rubizhne.</p>
<p>Reuters could not independently verify Ukraine's battlefield accounts.</p>
<p>Heavy clashes were taking place around Popasna, in Luhansk. Shelling was so intense it was not possible to collect bodies, said regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai.</p>
<p>"I don't even want to speak about what's happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don't exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them."</p>

<p>SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Some of Shanghai's 25 million people came out for brief walks and grocery shopping on Tuesday after enduring more than a month under a COVID lockdown, while China's capital Beijing embarked on another round of mass testing to control a nascent outbreak.</p>
<p>Social media posts showed Shanghai residents strolling in their suburbs, or queuing up at supermarkets that had been allowed to reopen. One picture showed two women carrying a pole with four bulky bags of groceries on their shoulders.</p>
<p>That was the result of an incremental easing of curbs in five of the city's 16 districts from Sunday, home to about a fifth of Shanghai's population, where some people were allowed to leave their housing compounds for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>The level of the restrictions varied from one residential complex to another. In many compounds, a single person from each household could go out at a time, for a maximum three hours.</p>
<p>Most do not get permission to drive or even ride a bike, prompting jokes on social media.</p>
<p>One WeChat page used to organise group orders for basic necessities during the lockdown listed a donkey priced at 88,888 yuan ($13,450) with a delivery date set after 365 years as an alternative to using vehicles to transport groceries.</p>
<p>"Please count me in for one of those donkey group buys," one resident commented to the post.</p>
<p>In China, the number eight is associated with prosperity.</p>
<p>Increasingly out of step with most other countries which have significantly eased or even completely lifted coronavirus restrictions, China has given no hint of deviating from its "zero COVID" policy.</p>
<p>China has accepted a heavy economic cost and demanded huge personal sacrifices from millions forced into prolonged isolation.</p>
<p>Many of these people have struggled with lost income, difficulty sourcing food and severe delays in access to emergency healthcare and other basic services. This has led to rare outbursts of anger in a sensitive year for President Xi Jinping, who is widely expected to secure a precedent-breaking third leadership term this fall.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities say their COVID policies aim to save as many lives as possible, pointing to the millions of deaths COVID has caused outside China.</p>
<p>Authorities reported 20 new COVID deaths on May 2, all in Shanghai, taking China's total to 5,112 since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>CAPITAL TIGHTENS CURBS</p>
<p>Beijing, with dozens of new cases daily in an outbreak in its second week, is banking on mass testing to locate and isolate infections and avert a Shanghai-like lockdown.</p>
<p>The capital of 22 million tightened COVID curbs over the five-day Labour Day holiday that runs through Wednesday, traditionally one the busiest periods for restaurants and tourism.</p>
<p>Twelve out of 16 Beijing districts will carry out a further three rounds of COVID tests between May 3 and 5, following three previous rounds of screening last week.</p>
<p>The capital's restaurants were closed for dining in and some apartment blocks were sealed shut. Most other venues were either closed, or demanded a negative PCR test from visitors.</p>
<p>Streets were quiet, with many residents fearing they might receive a quarantine order if found to have been in the proximity of a COVID case.</p>
<p>Beijing's new daily cases have been relatively steady since the first infections in the capital emerged on April 22, with a total of 62 detected on May 2.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the number of cases found outside quarantined areas was up to 73 from 58 - a setback after two consecutive days of zero such cases.</p>
<p>A period of zero cases in such areas, where some movement outside residential compounds is allowed, is a key requirement for a more significant relaxation of COVID curbs.</p>

They're also using social media platforms like YouTube to explain to Russians how they can use private networks and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt information.  </p><p>"The instructions, written in Russian, are meant to be relatively simple to follow," said the report. "Russians are told to use a VPN to contact the CIA They can also download the Tor browser, which allows users to access the dark web and submit information anonymously, without either the agency knowing where it came from or Russian security services knowing someone was contacting the Americans."<br/></p><p>CIA spokesperson Susan Miller explained that they're working to ensure that any Russian who wants to help the "unjust war" can do so "safely." The report also indicated they're using other means to push out information, but didn't disclose them. </p><p><u><em><strong>RELATED: </strong></em></u><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/petraeus-ukraine/" target="_self"><u><em><strong>David Petraeus: Top Russian military official getting 'desperate' as Putin leans on him to make progress </strong></em></u></a></p><p>Tor browsers protect the identity of those using it using encryptions bouncing through various different way-points around the world making it difficult to trace. </p><p>For the past months, anti-Putin Russians have protested in whatever ways they could. Putin responded by passing new laws that effectively outlaw using the words "war" or "invasion" to describe the attacks on Ukraine. Thousands of Russians have been arrested for what they're calling "fake news" that opposes the Russian military. </p><p>“The Kremlin is wiping out all options for dissent to ensure that brave anti-war protesters do not return to the streets,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/07/russia-criminalizes-independent-war-reporting-anti-war-protests" target="_blank">at Human Rights Watch</a>. “When President Putin goes after such a fundamental right – the cornerstone of democracy – with such totalitarian tactics, he is dispensing with any pretense that his government has any respect for rule of law, human rights, or democracy.”</p><p>Russian Channel One producer <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/russian-tv-protester/" target="_blank">Marina Ovsyannikova staged her own protest</a> in March, uploading a video to her Twitter account before she appeared on air with a poster saying that the government was lying to people about the war. <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/r-2656960142/" target="_blank">She now faces 15 years in prison.<br/></a></p><p><strong><em><u>RELATED: </u></em></strong><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/pentagon-official/" target="_self"><strong><em><u>Pentagon 'cannot confirm' reports that Russia's top general was injured during Ukraine visit</u></em></strong> </a></p><p>After Ovsyannikova was arrested, Channel One colleague <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/ukraine-russian-war-2656971912/" target="_blank">Zhanna Agalakova also quit her job</a> as the Europe correspondent for the Russian state television outlet.

<p>The new heavy fighting came as the European Union said it was bracing for a complete end to Russian gas supplies, with the bloc preparing another package of sanctions sure to anger President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>After failing to take the capital Kyiv, Moscow has shifted its two-month-old invasion to largely Russian-speaking areas and has stepped up pressure on Odessa, a celebrated cultural hub that is a crucial port on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Odessa's city council said that a Russian strike hit a residential building housing five people. A 15-year-old boy was killed and a girl was hospitalised, the council said on Telegram.</p>
<p>"A 14-year-old boy was killed. A 17-year-old girl was wounded, she has a shrapnel wound," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address, giving a different age for the boy.</p>
<p>"For what? What did these children... threaten the Russian state with? And that's how they fight. That's all," he said.</p>
<p>Fighting was particularly intense in eastern Ukraine around Izyum, Lyman and Rubizhne as the Russians prepared an attack on Severodonetsk, the farthest city still under Kyiv's control, Ukraine's general staff said.</p>
<p>In Lyman, relentless shelling has reduced hamlets around the city to rubble, according to AFP reporters.</p>
<p>"Half of the city is destroyed," said one resident, lifting luggage onto the roof of his beat-up Soviet-designed Lada car.</p>
<p>"I don't have a house anymore," he said.</p>
<p>The governor of the eastern region of Lugansk expected more intense battles ahead of May 9, the day Russia annually celebrates the 1945 surrender of Nazi Germany to allied forces, including the then-Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, told Italian television that Moscow's forces "will not artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day".</p>
<h1>'Sham referenda'</h1>
<p>Whatever Russia's military decisions, the United States warned that Moscow was preparing imminently to annex both Lugansk and neighbouring Donetsk.</p>
<p>Pro-Russian separatists in the two regions declared independence in 2014, but Moscow has so far stopped short of formally incorporating them as it did that year with the Crimean peninsula, which it seized through special forces in unmarked uniforms.</p>
<p>"Russia plans to engineer referenda upon joining sometime in mid-May," said Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</p>
<p>He said that Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified control and imposed use of its ruble currency.</p>
<p>"We think the reports are highly credible," Carpenter told reporters in Washington.</p>
<p>As with Crimea, he vowed that the international community would not support Russian-dictated changes to Ukraine's borders.</p>
<p>"Such sham referenda -- fabricated votes -- will not be considered legitimate, nor will any attempts to annex additional Ukrainian territory," Carpenter said.</p>
<p>"But we have to act with a sense of urgency."</p>
<h1>Evacuating battered Mariupol</h1>
<p>The invasion has killed thousands and displaced more than 13 million people in a war the scale of which has not been seen in Europe for generations.</p>
<p>Among the most battered cities is Mariupol, where an untold number have died and survivors have little access to food, water and medicine as Russia battles to connect the southern and eastern strips of land under its control.</p>
<p>Kyiv said more than 100 civilians were evacuated over the weekend from the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, where soldiers and civilians have been sheltering in a maze of underground tunnels.</p>
<p>Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraine's Azov unit, said that another 20 people were transferred out on Monday evening, but only after a five-hour delay as "the enemy's artillery caused new rubble and destruction."</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia have been coordinating civilian evacuations with the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>US State Department spokesman Ned Price called on Russia to allow humanitarian supplies to enter Mariupol and other besieged cities.</p>
<p>Doing so would "demonstrate that there may be a genuine humanitarian intent behind this evacuation and not just another craven attempt on the part of the Kremlin to charge the narrative," Price said.</p>
<p>Ukrainian forces have recaptured some territory in recent days, including the village of Ruska Lozova, which evacuees said had been occupied for two months.</p>
<p>"It was two months of terrible fear. Nothing else, a terrible and relentless fear," Natalia, a 28-year-old evacuee from Ruska Lozova, told AFP after reaching Kharkiv.</p>
<p>But Kyiv has admitted that Russian forces have captured a string of villages in the east and has asked Western powers to deliver more heavy weapons to bolster its defences there.</p>
<p>Ukraine's defence ministry said Monday that its drones had sunk two Russian patrol boats near the Black Sea's Snake Island, which became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance after soldiers there rebuffed Russian demands to surrender.</p>
<p>"The Bayraktars are working," said Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, referring to Turkish-made military drones.</p>
<h1>Bracing for new sanctions</h1>
<p>Western powers have levelled unprecedented sanctions against Russia over the war while delivering money and weapons to Ukraine, including a $33-billion (31 billion-euro) arms and support package announced by US President Joe Biden last week.</p>
<p>The European Commission will on Tuesday propose a new package of sanctions, including an embargo on Russian oil, officials said.</p>
<p>After talks on Monday, the European Union warned member states to prepare for a possible complete breakdown in gas supplies from Russia, insisting it would not cede to Moscow's demand that imports be paid for in rubles.</p>
<p>Germany, Europe's largest economy, before the war became heavily dependent on Russian gas, but European views quickly hardened after Putin attacked Ukraine.</p>
<p>EU and French officials said the 27-member bloc was united with Poland and Bulgaria, whose gas supplies were cut last week after they refused to pay in rubles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce Tuesday another £300 million ($376 million, 358 million euros) in military aid for Ukraine, his office said.</p>
<p>In a new blow to Russian prestige, European football's governing body, UEFA, announced that Russian clubs had been banned from participating in the Champions League and all other European competitions next season.</p>
<p>Western nations have been trying to show support by reopening embassies in Kyiv that were closed due to the invasion, with Denmark the latest to make the move Monday.</p>
<p>Kristina Kvien, the US charge d'affaires, announced in the western city of Lviv that Washington hopes to have diplomats back in Kyiv by the end of May.</p>

      <title>David Petraeus: Top Russian military official getting 'desperate' as Putin leans on him to make progress</title>

David Petraeus told CNN's Jake Tapper that a key Russian military official is feeling the heat for the ongoing failure of the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>"We're told that the chief of staff for the Russian military recently visited Ukraine, including the Donbas region," said Tapper. "The U.S. says it isn't sure why he traveled to the Russian front lines. What do you make of that?"</p><p>"Well, he's probably trying to figure out what is going on, why can't we make progress?" said Petraeus, who previously headed the CIA. "He's down there trying to work with the commander. You know, they now have one commander in charge, General Dvornikov, the Butcher of Syria, known for the bombing of Aleppo in 2016. They really haven't made the progress that they hoped to achieve. And so he's probably down there trying to figure out why is it that we can't achieve combined armed effects. Why is it we can't integrate air and ground operations, why aren't we doing better? And of course, he did narrowly avoid, apparently, the demolition of the command post at which he was located during his visit. With a loss of another Russian general, reportedly."</p><p>"So again, he is probably getting desperate," said Petraeus. "I'm sure that President Putin is putting enormous pressure on him and on Defense Minister Shoigu, to achieve something, again, that he can announce, Putin can announce, on 9 May in Moscow."</p><p><u><em><strong>RELATED: </strong></em></u><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/russia-depravity-jewish-hitler/" target="_self"><u><em><strong>Russia just demonstrated their ‘total depravity’ – according to this former US ambassador </strong></em></u></a></p><p>Petraeus has <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/consequences-for-putin-s-war-on-ukraine-are-going-to-start-to-come-home-to-roost-in-moscow-gen-david-petraeus/" target="_blank">previously predicted</a> that Putin will face severe political consequences for the Ukraine invasion as the worldwide embargo against Russia causes economic collapse.

One problem is that, at the time in question, Jews did not have the right to live in Graz, he adds.</p><p>So who was Hitler's grandfather? "This is a question without an answer," historian Ofer Aderet wrote in Israel's Haaretz newspaper Monday.</p><p>Some Nazis still aired this theory "as an attempt to provide an explanation for their defeat in World War II", he argued.</p><p>"Other reports claimed that Hitler's persecution of the Jews resulted from feelings of shame about his partial Jewish ancestry," he added.</p><p>"The bottom line, though, is that there is no historical proof for any of this."</p><p>Israel's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Monday condemned Lavrov's remarks as "an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error.</p><p>"Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust," Lapid added. This kind of claim was the worst kind of anti-Semitism, he said.</p><p>Prime Minister Naftali Bennett denounced Lavrov's comments as "lies", and the foreign ministry has summoned Russia's ambassador for an explanation.</p><p>Russia has repeatedly justified what it calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine as a mission to "demilitarise" and "denazify" the country.</p>]]></description>
