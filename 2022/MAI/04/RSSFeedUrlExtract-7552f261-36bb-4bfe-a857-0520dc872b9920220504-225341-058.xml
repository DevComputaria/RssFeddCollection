<h3><strong>The transition into CWPP <br/><br/></strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Agility and flexibility were key directives in the development of new technology, which is why on-premise assets soon transitioned into virtual machines, which further transformed into compact and swift containers. Modern enterprise network environments are increasingly transforming to be cloud-based, where both applications and data storage are hosted in a cloud — and often multi-cloud — environment. The attack surfaces and security protection requirements of software in distributed cloud environments are vastly different from traditional network architectures where applications and data were hosted on enterprise-owned servers in on-premises data centers.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3659868/cwpp-how-to-secure-cloud-native-applications-built-with-containers.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether a company utilizes a private, hybrid or public cloud infrastructure or offers cloud services to others, it is critical that each cloud instance and service be isolated to help minimize the risk of data compromise. In a traditional network, networking equipment and firewalls segment and isolate physical servers and other devices. However, to effectively isolate cloud instances, technologies like <a href="https://www.hillstonenet.com/solutions/micro-segmentation/" rel="nofollow">micro-segmentation</a> are needed.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-segmentation can help minimize damage caused by a compromised cloud asset. It can reduce the severity to a contained incident that can be remediated quickly versus an expansive data breach that spans multiple parts of the business, or numerous clients in a multi-tenant service. While proper implementation of micro-segmentation is vital, at a high-level view it can be summarized as a 5-step process.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3659791/protecting-cloud-assets-in-5-steps-with-micro-segmentation.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Software-defined wide area networking, or <a href="https://www.hillstonenet.com/solutions/secure-sd-wan-for-enterprise/" rel="nofollow">SD-WAN</a>, is the next frontier for the network edge. Multiple analysts report that the SD-WAN market is in the billions of dollars, with an annual growth rate in the 25% to 35% range. Managed service providers and carriers globally are increasingly deploying managed SD-WAN services to reach new markets. Almost all networking and security vendors have SD-WAN offerings, complicating the decision when choosing an SD-WAN solution.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Security and WAN connectivity decisions have become a collaborative decision between the security and networking teams. Prior to this, enterprise networking teams were responsible for setting up connectivity to major company locations, while connections to branches and remote offices fell to the enterprise WAN manager.

<p>What is the best way for a small- to medium-sized business (SMB) to protect itself from ransomware? Ransomware is impacting firms around the world. <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/rpt-m-Prediction22-000410-02.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mandiant</a> has indicated that ransomware is on the rise and doesn’t appear to be slowing down one bit. These are the nine tasks that SMBs should focus on to mitigate risk from ransomware attacks.</p><h2>1. Have a backup plan and tested recovery process</h2>
<p>Some might argue that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is the best way to protect a firm, but I’d argue that having a tested <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3627828/ransomware-recovery-8-steps-to-successfully-restore-from-backup.html">backup and recovery process</a> would be better. Too often businesses overlook having a backup and a tested recovery process. Especially for firms with on-premises servers and domain controllers, have a process where someone – in the firm or a consultant or managed service provider -- perform a dry run of an actual recovery process. When I’ve done a dry run, I often find that I need to perform some step that I’ve forgotten to restore from a bare metal process. You may find that a HyperV parent needs additional steps or you need to take ownership of the restoration image to fully restore a Hyper V server or virtual machine to full working condition. Ensure that you have a recovery script or manual in place so that staff tasked to recover know the steps. The documented steps will help lower the stress of the event.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658852/9-most-important-steps-for-smbs-to-defend-against-ransomware-attacks.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Conversely, one that is problematic and incohesive can have the opposite effect, negatively impacting a company’s security practices and leaving them vulnerable to risks and wasted investment.</p><p>“For CISOs, maintaining a positive relationship with their security vendors is an important element in staying informed on industry related trends, providing competitive analysis on alternative solutions and building trust in order to take on large partner-enabled initiatives,” John Hellickson, executive advisor at cybersecurity consultancy Coalfire, tells CSO. He notes that CISOs often have a select group of key security vendors that have become trusted partners where the relationship is mutually beneficial. “When CISOs fail to maintain positive working relationships with their security vendors they will often see their vendor provide less of a priority on their needs and overall responsiveness can be delayed, and in worst cases they may be flagged as a toxic account that no sales representative wants to be assigned,” he says.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658976/secrets-to-a-building-a-healthy-ciso-vendor-partnership.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Cybersecurity pros interested in metrics and measures frequently ponder and pontificate on what measures would be best to show the board of directors. That can be a tricky proposition because “we have to speak like the business” is also a mantra. Coming up with cybersecurity metrics from a business perspective can be a challenge. So how can we solve this problem and provide useful insight?</p><p>Well, first we have to recognize that the board level is the highest strategic level in the company.

<h2>Computer virus definition</h2>
<p>A computer virus is a form of malicious software that piggybacks onto legitimate application code in order to spread and reproduce itself.</p><p>Like other <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2615925/security-your-quick-guide-to-malware-types.html">types of malware</a>, a virus is deployed by attackers to damage or take control of a computer. Its name comes from the method by which it infects its targets. A biological virus like HIV or the flu cannot reproduce on its own; it needs to hijack a cell to do that work for it, wreaking havoc on the infected organism in the process. Similarly, a computer virus isn't itself a standalone program. It's a code snippet that inserts itself into some other application. When that application runs, it executes the virus code, with results that range from the irritating to the disastrous.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3406446/computer-viruses-explained-definition-types-and-examples.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

The groups previously used other downloaders like BazaLoader and IcedID.</p><p>According to researchers from security firm Proofpoint, Bumblebee email-based distribution campaigns started in March and were linked back to at least three known attack groups. The malware is used to deploy known penetration testing implants such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver and Meterpreter.

<p>Phishing continues to be one of the primary attack mechanisms for bad actors with a variety of endgames in mind, in large part because phishing attacks are trivial to launch and difficult to fully protect against. Some phishing attacks target customers rather than employees, and others simply aim to damage your corporate reputation rather than compromise your systems. A key factor in protecting your business from phishing is to understand your vulnerabilities, weigh the potential risk to your business, and decide what tools offer the best protection to match your business needs.</p><h2>Why phishing is successful</h2>
<p>Most phishing attacks are less about the technology and more about social engineering. It’s amazing how easily humans are manipulated when emotions are triggered. Many modern phishing emails play on empathy or fear, or even make hostile accusations in order to trigger an angry response.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3575080/9-top-anti-phishing-tools-and-services.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Managed detection and response (MDR) service provider Proficio has launched ProSOC Identity Threat Detection and Response to protect businesses from identity-based attacks and credential abuse. The firm claimed the service is the industry’s only vendor-agnostic Open XDR solution that supports identity threat detection and response and works with existing security tools without proprietary agents or sensors. The release comes at a time when identity-based threats are one of the top cybersecurity risks faced by organizations.</p><h2><strong>Service aims to increase visibility, quicken responses, reduce ransomware</strong></h2>

<p>The 2022 RSA Security Conference is just weeks away, and the security diaspora is boosted and ready to meet in person at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.</p><p>While we’ve certainly accomplished a lot working remotely over the past 2 years, cybersecurity remains in a precarious position in 2022, so an industry huddle is in order. We are at a point where the scale and complexity of historical security defenses either aren’t working or are stretched to their limits. This means CISOs need to think about security transformation, and as they do, every process and layer of the security technology stack is in play.</p><p>Now, there will be plenty of hype at the conference around security “platforms” like <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3633896/5-observations-about-xdr.html">extended detection and response (XDR)</a>, cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs), <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3574014/what-is-sase-a-cloud-service-that-marries-sd-wan-with-security.html">secure access service edge (SASE)</a>, and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247848/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html">zero trust</a>—all important topics but also strewn with industry hype and associated user confusion. My good friend Candy Alexander, president of ISSA International, and I will be discussing these trends during our RSA <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/USA/agenda/session/A%20Sanity%20Check%20on%20Technology%20Viewpoints%20from%20Security%20Professionals" rel="nofollow">session</a> on Tuesday morning (6/7).  But when I’m not presenting with Candy, I’ll be learning everything I can about security operations center (SOC) modernization.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658230/soc-modernization-8-key-considerations.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Notorious threat group Emotet has been detected testing new and significantly different attack techniques potentially in preparation for larger campaigns or selective and limited attacks, according to research from cybersecurity vendor Proofpoint.

After a 10-month disappearance from the threat landscape, the group re-emerged in November 2021 and has since targeted thousands of users in multiple geographic regions. In some cases, the volume of malicious messages used in individual campaigns has reached over one million, Proofpoint stated. However, activity detected between April 4 and April 19, 2022, signifies a significant departure from Emotet’s typical attack behaviors, and is attributed to threat actor TA542.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658550/emotet-tests-new-attack-techniques-sign-of-things-to-come.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
