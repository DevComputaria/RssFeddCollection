So, we should make sure our passwords are words or phrases that we can easily remember, right? While this might be the most convenient option, there are more secure ways to digitally lock up your most sensitive </span><span data-contrast="auto">personally identifiable information</span><span data-contrast="none"> (PII). In celebration of World Password Day, we’re diving into how you can practice top-notch password security without compromising convenience.</span><span data-contrast="none">1</span> <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">The Nature of the Password</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over the years, the </span><span data-contrast="auto">password</span><span data-contrast="auto"> has remained a good first line of defense against cyberattacks. However, most of us tend to choose passwords based on memorable things from our lives, like family names or our pets’ birthdays. As it turns out, these details are easy for hackers to find on social media sites like Facebook or LinkedIn. It’s also human nature to opt for convenience, and for many people that means setting easy-to-remember and easy-to-guess passwords. Plus, out of convenience, people often reuse passwords across multiple accounts and services. The downside is that if one account becomes compromised, all accounts become compromised.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As an alternative to single-word passwords, many security experts advocate for </span><span data-contrast="auto">passphrases </span><span data-contrast="auto">over passwords. Passphrases are longer strings of words and characters that are easier for you to remember and harder for nefarious software and cybercriminals to guess than random strings of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. But, according to a study, the average American internet user was projected to have 300 online accounts by 2022.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Can you imagine memorizing 300 different passphrases? We can all agree that sounds pretty unrealistic, so users tend to look for other solutions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Do You Save Your Password in a Browser? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If the answer is yes, you may want to reconsider, as there are several risks associated with this practice. Although it&#8217;s convenient to have your browser save your passwords, they tend to do a lousy job of safeguarding your passwords, credit card numbers and personal details, such as your name and address.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s take Google Chrome, for example. Unlike most dedicated password managers, Chrome doesn’t use a primary password to encrypt all your credentials. (Note that some browsers do use one, and are therefore more secure, though you’ll still need to trust your browser provider.) This makes your Chrome-stored passwords relatively weak to “local” attacks. For example, if someone gets hold of—or guesses—your Windows password, they can then see all the logins stored in your browser’s password manager.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another consideration to note is that the security of all your accounts is tied to your browser account’s security. Let’s say you use the sync option to make your credentials available on all your devices. This means that logins are stored in the cloud and, though encrypted, if someone manages to hack into your browser account, they will gain access to all your logins. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Keep Your Accounts Secure Without Compromising Convenience</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What can you do to help ensure your online profiles are kept safe without spending hours managing a complex list of passwords? Here are some easy ways to lock down your digital life without sacrificing convenience: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use a password manager to store unique, complex passwords for all your accounts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-a-password-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a software application that stores your passwords and other sensitive information. You can install it on computers or mobile devices and store all passwords in an encrypted file (or database). The best option is to use a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/secure-your-passwords/#:~:text=Never%20forget%20your%20passwords%20again,Mac%2C%20iPhone%20or%20Android%20devices." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> like </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to store and create strong, random passwords for each site you visit. You’ll have one primary password that grants access to the rest of them—ideally, a long and random passphrase that you can remember. Once everything is set up, it should be seamless. As you log in to new sites, the password manager will offer to save your credentials for later use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Turn on two-factor authentication for every site that offers it</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the best ways to protect your accounts against unauthorized access is to turn on two-factor authentication for every site that offers it. Using two-factor authentication means a site will prompt you for a unique security code, in addition to your password, whenever you log in to an account for which you have enabled this feature. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring another form of identification after you enter your username and password. Some services send a temporary passcode over a text message. Others require the user to approve login attempts from new devices using an app. If someone steals your device or gains access to your account details, they’re out of luck unless they also have access to this second piece of information. Two-factor authentication is available on a wide range of websites and can help keep your accounts safe from would-be hackers, so you should always use it when available. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use a virtual private network (VPN) when out and about</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/why-everyone-needs-a-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, or virtual private network, encrypts your data and masks your online behavior from snooping third parties. When you go to a website, your computer connects to the server where the site is hosted, and that website can see a certain amount of data about you and your computer. With a VPN, you connect to a private server first, which scrambles your data and makes it more difficult for digital eavesdroppers to track what you’re doing online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">VPNs can provide users with greater peace of mind when on the go. Say you’re traveling on a business trip and need to connect to the Wi-Fi network provided by your hotel. </span><span data-contrast="none">Shifty characters often lurk on unprotected, free networks (such as those provided by hotels, coffee shops, airports, etc.) to lift </span><span data-contrast="auto">PII</span><span data-contrast="none"> from people handling sensitive emails, making banking transactions, or shopping online. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> encrypts your online activity with bank-grade encryption to protect your data from prying eyes. With a premium paid plan, you can protect up to five devices at once and enjoy unlimited data protection. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Best of Both Worlds: Security and Convenience</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With your growing number of accounts all requiring passwords—emails, social media profiles, online banking—it’s no wonder that people tend to reuse passwords across multiple sites. This may be convenient, but it creates significant security risks if a suspicious actor manages to obtain one of your passwords and attempts to use it elsewhere. That’s why having strong passwords matters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do yourself a favor and opt for a dedicated password manager that will auto-save and store your credentials for you, so you only have one password to remember. Who says security and simplicity can’t coexist? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

You’ll receive a free gift! All you have to do is provide your credit card information. Sounds easy, right? This is a brand you’ve followed and trusted for a while now. You’ve engaged with them and even purchased some of their items. The link comes directly from their official page, so you don’t think to question it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is the same mindset that led to several Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs being stolen by a cybercriminal who had hacked into the company’s official Instagram account. Let’s dive into the details of this scam. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Sneaking Into the Bored Ape Yacht Club</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bored Ape Yacht Club, the NFT collection, disclosed through Twitter that their Instagram account had been hacked, and advised users not to click on any links or link their </span><a href="http://crypto%20wallets/"><span data-contrast="none">crypto wallets</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to anything. The hacker managed to log into the account and post a phishing link promoting an “airdrop,” or a free token giveaway, to users who connected their MetaMask wallets. Those who linked their wallets before BAYC’s warning lost a combined amount of over $1 million in NFTs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite the large price tag attached to NFTs, they are often held in smartphone wallets rather than more secure alternatives. MetaMask, the crypto wallet application, only allows NFT display through mobile devices and encourages users to use the smartphone app to manage them. While it may be a good method for display purposes, this limitation provides hackers with a new and effective way to easily steal from users’ mobile wallets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">BAYC does not yet know how the hacker was able to gain access to their Instagram account, but they are following security best practices and actively working to contact the users affected.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This scam was conducted through the official BAYC account, making it appear legitimate to BAYC’s followers. It is incredibly important to stay vigilant and know how to protect yourself and your assets from scams like these. Follow the tips below to steer clear of phishing scams and keep your digital assets safe: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A seed phrase is the “open sesame” to your cryptocurrency wallet. The string of words is what grants you access to all your wallet’s assets. Ensuring that your seed phrase is stored away safely and not easily accessible by anyone but yourself is the first step to making sure your wallet is secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all transactional and wallet data publicly available, scammers can pick and choose their targets based on who appears to own valuable assets. To protect your privacy and avoid being targeted, refrain from sharing your personal information on social media sites or using your NFT as a social media avatar.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing scams targeting NFT collectors are becoming increasingly common. Be wary of any airdrops offering free tokens in exchange for your information or other “collectors” doing the same.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing scams tend to get more sophisticated over time, especially in cases like the Bored Ape Yacht Club where the malicious links are coming straight from the official account. It is always best to remain skeptical and cautious, but when in doubt, here are some extra tips to spot phishing scams:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee’s Mobile Research Team introduced a new Android malware targeting Instagram users who want to increase their followers or likes in the last post. As we researched more about this threat, we found another malware type that uses different technical methods to steal user’s credentials. The target is users who are not satisfied with the default functions provided by Instagram. Various Instagram modification application already exists for those users on the Internet. The new malware we found pretends to be a popular mod app and steals Instagram credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Behavior analysis</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Instander is one of the famous Instagram modification applications available for Android devices to help Instagram users access extra helpful features. The mod app supports uploading high-quality images and downloading posted photos and videos.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The initial screens of this malware and Instander are similar, as shown below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154465" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insta-1.png" alt="" width="362" height="746" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insta-1.png 362w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insta-1-146x300.png 146w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insta-1-63x129.png 63w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-154423 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insata-2.png" alt="" width="362" height="761" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insata-2.png 362w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insata-2-143x300.png 143w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/insata-2-61x129.png 61w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 1. Instander legitimate app(left) and Mmalware(right)</strong></em></p>
<p>Next, this malware requests account(username or email) and password. Finally, this malware displays an error message regardless of whether the login information is correct.</p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 2. Malware requests account and password</strong></em></p>
<p>The malware steals the user’s username and password in a very unique way. The main trick is to use the Firebase API. First, the user input value is combined with l@gmail.com. This value and static password(=kamalw20051) are then sent via the Firebase API, createUserWithEmailAndPassword. And next, the password process is the same. After receiving the user&#8217;s account and password input, this malware will request it twice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154297" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comde.png" alt="" width="907" height="162" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comde.png 907w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comde-300x54.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comde-768x137.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comde-205x37.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 3. Main method to use Firebase API</strong></em></p>
<p>Since we cannot see the dashboard of the malware author, we tested it using the same API. As a result, we checked the user input value in plain text on the dashboard.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154255" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/auth.png" alt="" width="905" height="491" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/auth.png 905w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/auth-300x163.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/auth-768x417.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/auth-205x111.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 4. Firebase dashboard built for testing</strong></em></p>
<p>According to the Firebase document, createUserWithEmailAndPassword API is to create a new user account associated with the specified email address and password. Because the first parameter is defined as email patterns, the malware author uses the above code to create email patterns regardless of user input values.</p>
<p>It is an API for creating accounts in the Firebase so that the administrator can check the account name in the Firebase dashboard. The victim&#8217;s account and password have been requested as Firebase account name, so it should be seen as plain text without hashing or masking.</p>
<h2><strong>Network traffic</strong></h2>
<p>As an interesting point on the network traffic of the malware, this malware communicates with the Firebase server in Protobuf format in the network. The initial configuration of this Firebase API uses the JSON format. Although the Protobuf format is readable enough, it can be assumed that this malware author intentionally attempts to obfuscate the network traffic through the additional settings. Also, the domain used for data transfer(=www.googleapis.com) is managed by Google. Because it is a domain that is too common and not dangerous, many network filtering and firewall solutions do not detect it.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned, users should always be careful about installing 3rd party apps. Aside from the types of malware we&#8217;ve introduced so far, attackers are trying to steal users&#8217; credentials in a variety of ways. Therefore, you should employ security software on your mobile devices and always keep up to date.</p>
<p>Fortunately, McAfee Mobile Security is able to detect this as Android/InstaStealer and protect you from similar threats. For more information visit  <a href="https://www.mcafeemobilesecurity.com">McAfee Mobile Security</a></p>

<p>Instagram has become a platform with over a billion monthly active users. Many of Instagram&#8217;s users are looking to increase their follower numbers, as this has become a symbol of a person&#8217;s popularity.  Instagram’s large user base has not gone unnoticed to cybercriminals. McAfee&#8217;s Mobile Research Team recently found new Android malware disguised in an app to increase Instagram followers</p>
<h2><strong>How can you increase your followers or likes</strong></h2>
<p>You can easily find apps on the internet that increase the number of Instagram followers. Some of these apps require both a user account and a password. Other types of apps only need the user to input their user account. But are these apps safe to use?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154165" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sus-apps.png" alt="" width="906" height="559" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sus-apps.png 906w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sus-apps-300x185.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sus-apps-768x474.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sus-apps-205x126.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 1. Suspicious apps in Google Images</em></strong></p>
<p>Many YouTubers explain how to use these apps with tutorial videos. They log into the app with their own account and show that the number of followers is increasing. Among the many videos, the domain that appears repeatedly was identified</p>
<p>The way the domain introduces is very simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in with user account and password.</li>
<li>Check credentials via Instagram API.</li>
<li>After logging in, the user can enjoy many features provided by the app. (free followers, free likes, unlimited comments, etc.)</li>
<li>In the case of free followers, the user needs to input how many followers they want to gain.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154123" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/follower.png" alt="" width="362" height="756" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/follower.png 362w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/follower-144x300.png 144w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/follower-62x129.png 62w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>. A screenshot to increase the number of followers by entering in 20 followers.</strong></em></p>
<p>When you run the function, you can see that the number of followers increases every few seconds.</p>

<p><em><strong>Figure </strong><strong>3</strong></em><strong><em>. New follower notifications appear in the feed.</em> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How does this malware spread?</strong></h2>
<p>Some Telegram channels are promoting YouTube videos with domain links to the malware.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154039" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/telegram.png" alt="" width="907" height="626" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/telegram.png 907w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/telegram-300x207.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/telegram-768x530.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/telegram-187x129.png 187w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure </strong><strong>4</strong><strong>. Message being promoted on Telegram</strong></em></p>
<p>We have also observed a video from a famous YouTuber with over 190,000 subscribers promoting a malicious app. However, in the video, we found some concerning comments with people complaining that their credentials were being stolen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-153997 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm1.png" alt="" width="902" height="260" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm1.png 902w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm1-300x86.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm1-768x221.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm1-205x59.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-153955 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm2.png" alt="" width="902" height="179" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm2.png 902w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm2-300x60.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm2-768x152.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/comm2-205x41.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 5. Many people complain that their Instagram accounts are being compromised</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Behavior Analysis in Malware</strong></h2>
<p>We analyzed the application that is being promoted by the domain. The hidden malware does not require many permissions and therefore does not appear to be harmful. When users launch the app, they can only see the below website via the Android Webview.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-153913 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll.png" alt="" width="368" height="754" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll.png 368w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll-146x300.png 146w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll-63x129.png 63w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-153871" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll2.png" alt="" width="368" height="754" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll2.png 368w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll2-146x300.png 146w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/free-foll2-63x129.png 63w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 6. Redirect to malicious website via Android Webview</em></strong></p>
<p>After inspecting the app, we observe the initial code does not contain many features. After showing an advertisement, it will immediately show the malicious website. Malicious activities are performed at the website&#8217;s backend rather than within the Android app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154207" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/code.png" alt="" width="696" height="109" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/code.png 696w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/code-300x47.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/code-205x32.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 7. Simple 2 lines of initial code</strong></em></p>
<p>The website says that your transactions are carried out using the Instagram API system with your username and password. It is secure because they use the user&#8217;s credentials via Instagram&#8217;s official server, not their remote server.</p>
<p>Contrary to many people&#8217;s expectations, we received abnormal login attempts from Turkey a few minutes after using the app. The device logged into the account was not an Instagram server but a personal device model of Huawei as LON-L29</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-153829" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fake-login.png" alt="" width="907" height="528" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fake-login.png 907w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fake-login-300x175.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fake-login-768x447.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fake-login-205x119.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 8. Abnormal login attempt notification</strong></em></p>
<p>As shown above, they don&#8217;t use an Instagram API. In addition, as you request followers, the number of the following also increases. In other words, the credentials you provided are used to increase the number of followers of other requesters. Everyone who uses this app has a relationship with each other. Moreover, they will store and use your credentials in their database without your acknowledgment.</p>
<h2><strong>How many users are affected?</strong></h2>
<p>The languages of most communication channels were English, Portuguese, and Hindi. Especially, Hindi was the most common, and most videos had more than 100 views. In the case of a famous YouTuber&#8217;s video, they have recorded more than 2,400 views. In addition, our test account had 400 followers in one day. It means that at least 400 users have sent credentials to the malware author.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As we mentioned in the opening remarks, many Instagram users want to increase their followers and likes. Unfortunately, attackers are also aware of the desires of these users and use that to attack them.</p>
<p>Therefore, users who want to install these apps should consider that their credentials may be leaked. In addition, there may be secondary attacks such as credential stuffing (=use of a stolen username and password pairs on another website). Aside from the above cases, there are many unanalyzed similar apps on the Internet. You shouldn&#8217;t use suspicious apps to get followers and likes.</p>

Now, you can feel more confident by r</span><span data-contrast="none">emoving personal info from data broker sites and keeping it from being collected, sold, and used to: advertise products to you, fill your email box with spam, and can even give criminals the info they need to steal your identity. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s look at why we&#8217;re offering Personal Data Cleanup, how it protects your privacy, and why it’s a great addition to the online protection we already offer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2>Does the cost of a connected life have to be your privacy?</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s so much to enjoy when you live a connected life – free email, online stores that remember what you like, social media that connects you to friends and influencers. It’s a world of convenience, opportunity, and incredible content. It’s also a world where your data is constantly collected. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><strong>“Wait. Did you say my data?” </strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s right, companies are collecting your personal data. They’re called data brokers and they make money by selling information that specifically identifies you, like an email address. They sell this information to marketers looking to target you with ads. Criminals can also use it to build profiles in service of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">stealing your identity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and accessing your accounts. This activity takes place behind the scenes and often without consumers’ knowledge.  There are also data brokers known as people search sites that compile and sell info like home addresses, emails, phones, court records, employment info, and more. These websites give identity thieves, hackers, stalkers, and other malicious actors easy access to your info. Regardless of how your data is being used, it’s clear that these days a more connected life often comes at the cost of your privacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Consumers are clamoring for more privacy online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In a recent survey of McAfee customers, we found that 59% have become more protective of their personal data over the past six months. And it’s no wonder. Over the past two years, trends like telehealth, remote working, and increased usage of online shopping and financial services have meant that more of your time is being spent online. Unsurprisingly, more personal data is being made available in the process. This leads us to the most alarming finding of our survey &#8211; 95% of consumers whose personal information ends up on data broker sites had it collected without their consent. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s the crux of a popular privacy topic. Namely, are we giving up some of our privacy in exchange for the convenience of a smart speaker that does our bidding with the sound of our voice? After all, you’re using it to do everything from search for music, order online, and control the lights and temperature in your home.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What is your smart speaker really hearing—and recording?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Let’s take a look at what’s going on inside of your smart speaker, how it processes your requests, and what companies do with the recordings and transcripts of your voice.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">So, are smart speakers listening in?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">More or less, smart speakers are listening to all the time. Each smart speaker has its own “wake word” that it listens for, like </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Alexa</span></i><span data-contrast="none">, </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Siri</span></i><span data-contrast="none">, or </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Google</span></i><span data-contrast="none">. When the device hears that wake word or thinks it hears it, it begins recording and awaits your verbal commands. Unless you have the microphone or listening feature turned off, your device indeed actively listens for that wake word all the time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Here’s where things get interesting, though. There’s a difference between “listening” and “recording.” The act of listening is passive. Your smart speaker is waiting to hear its name. That’s it. Once it does hear its name, it begins recording for a few seconds to record your command. From there, your spoken command goes into the company’s cloud for processing by way of an encrypted connection. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There are exceptions to when your command may go to the company’s cloud for processing, like Siri on iPhones, which </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20sign%20in%20with%20your%20Apple%C2%A0ID%20to%20use%20Siri%2C%20and%20the%20audio%20of%20your%20requests%20is%20processed%20entirely%20on%20your%20iPhone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">according to Apple</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, “You don’t sign in with your Apple ID to use Siri, and the audio of your requests is processed entirely on your iPhone.” Also, </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google Assistant may process some requests without going to the cloud</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, like “When a user triggers a smart home Action that has a local fulfillment path, Assistant sends the EXECUTE intent or QUERY intent to the Google Home or Google Nest device rather than the cloud fulfillment.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the cases where information does go to the cloud, processing entails a few things. First, it makes sure that the wake word was heard. If it’s determined that the wake word was indeed spoken (or something close enough to it—more on that in a minute), the speaker follows through on the request or command. Depending on your settings, that activity may get stored in your account history, whether as a voice recording, transcript, or both. If the wake word was not detected, processing ends at that point.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Enter the issue of mistaken wake words. While language models and processing technologies used by smart speakers are constantly evolving, there are occasions where a smart speaker acts as if a wake word was heard when it simply wasn’t said. Several </span><a href="https://unacceptable-privacy.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">studies on the topic</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> have been </span><a href="https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/smart-speakers-study-pets20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">published in recent years</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. In the case of research from Northeastern University, it was found that dialogue from popular television shows could be interpreted as wake words that trigger recording. For example, their findings cite:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“We then looked at other shows with a similarly high dialogue density (such as </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Gilmore</span></i> <i><span data-contrast="none">Girls</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><i><span data-contrast="none">The Office</span></i><span data-contrast="none">) and found that they also have a high number of activations, which suggests that the number of activations is at least in part related to the density of dialogue. However, we have also noticed that if we consider just the amount of dialogue (in a number of words), </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Narcos</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> is the one that triggers the most activations, even if it has the lowest dialogue density.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Of interest is not just the volume of dialogue, but the pronunciation of the dialogue:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“We investigated the actual dialogue that produced </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Narcos</span></i><span data-contrast="none">‘ activations and we have seen that it was mostly Spanish dialogue and poorly pronounced English dialogue. This suggests that, in general, words that are not pronounced clearly may lead to more unwanted activations.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Research such as this suggests that smart speakers at the time had room for improvement when it comes to properly detect wake words, thus leading to parts of conversation being recorded without the owner intending it. If you own a smart speaker, I wouldn’t be too surprised to hear that you’ve had some issues like that from time to time yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As mentioned above, the makers of smart speakers make constant improvements to their devices and services, which may include the review of commands from users to make sure they are interpreted correctly. There are typically two types of review—machine and human. As the names suggest, a machine review is a digital analysis and human reviews entail someone listening to and evaluating a recorded command or reading and evaluating a transcript of a written command.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, several manufacturers let you exercise some control over that. In fact, you’ll find that they post a fair share of articles about this collection and review process, along with your choices for opting in or out as you wish:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The quickest way to ensure a more private experience with your smart speaker is to disable listening—or turn it off entirely. Depending on the device, you may be able to do this with the push of a button, a voice command, or some combination of the two. This will keep the device from listening for its wake word. Likewise, this makes your smart speaker unresponsive to voice commands until you enable them again. This approach works well if you decide there are certain stretches of the day where your smart speaker doesn’t need to be on call.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet let’s face it, the whole idea of a smart speaker is to have it on and ready to take your requests. For those stretches where you leave it on, there’s another step you can take to shore up your privacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In addition to making sure you’re opted out of the review process mentioned above, you can also delete your recordings associated with your voice commands.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Managing your voice history like this gives you yet one more way you can take control of your privacy. In many ways, it’s like deleting your search history from your browser. And when you consider just how much activity and how many queries your smart speaker may see over the course of days, weeks, and months, you can imagine just how much information that captures about you and your family. Some of it is undoubtedly personal. Deleting that history can help protect your privacy in the event that information ever gets breached or somehow ends up in the hands of a bad actor. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

In the case of ours, we provide a full range of privacy and device protection, along with identity theft protection that includes $1M identity theft coverage, identity monitoring, and identity restoration assistance from recovery pros—and antivirus too, of course. Together, they can make your time spent online far more secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">You’re the smart one in this relationship</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With privacy becoming an increasingly hot topic (rightfully so!), several companies have been taking steps to make the process of managing yours easier and a more prevalent part of their digital experience. As you can see, there are several ways you can take charge of how your smart speaker uses, and doesn’t use, your voice.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It used to be that many of these settings were tucked away deep in menus, rather than something companies would tout on web pages dedicated to privacy. So as far as smart speakers go, the information is out there, and I hope this article helps make the experience with yours more private and secure. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

As more people dive into the nitty-gritty of what blockchain is, how NFTs are traded, and the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum, digital currency developers are finding new ways for people to engage with crypto. But as crypto continues to grow and become more profitable, hackers are simultaneously trying to find ways to get their hands on the coins.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to Markets Insider, one of the biggest crypto heists in history took place recently, resulting in roughly $625 million stolen.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Here’s what you need to know about this crypto theft, and how you can stay protected when investing in digital assets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><span data-contrast="auto">Under the Hood of the Ronin Crypto Heist</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ronin, the blockchain underlying the play-to-earn crypto game </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Axie Infinity</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, revealed that a hacker stole 173,600 Ethereum (currently worth around $600 million) and 25.2 million USDC (a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar), resulting in a loss of about $625 million in cryptocurrency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On March 29</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">, Ronin and </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Axie Infinity</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> operator Sky Mavis revealed the breach and froze transactions on the Ronin bridge, which allows depositing and withdrawing funds from the company’s blockchain. This “side chain” contained nine validator nodes, or proof-of-stake tools, that confirmed and approved each transaction. At least five validator nodes are needed to approve each transaction. Sky Mavis oversaw five, and Axie Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or DAO) controlled four. However, Sky Mavis discontinued its agreement with the DAO in December but failed to revoke the DAO’s permissions. Due to this oversight, the hacker was able to take over the necessary amount of validator nodes to enable access to the cryptocurrency and make a break with it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to experts, the use of these side chains rather than native blockchains leads to a rise in cryptocurrency vulnerabilities. Had Sky Mavis abandoned the side chains and stuck to the blockchains, it is likely that an attack of this magnitude could have been avoided. Rather than a cryptocurrency issue, this is more of a cybersecurity issue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you are interested in getting into crypto, don’t let cyberattacks like this deter you! As a fairly new phenomenon, there are still many ways in which the crypto world needs to grow, adjust, and adapt to ensure that users can interact with it safely. In the meantime, if you are wanting to dive into the crypto economy but still have reservations, here are some tips to help you stay protected:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">1. Do your research</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whenever you decide to dive into something new, it’s always important to make sure you are knowledgeable about that thing, especially if it involves investing your money. Before jumping right into the crypto world, research each cryptocurrency, each blockchain, and any software you may use. Keep up with the news to stay informed on security breaches and pick up tips for which system you may want to engage in. Knowing the ins and outs of the crypto economy and its security protocols will solidify your decision of whether you want to join the crypto community and whether the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/do-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-outweigh-the-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">benefits outweigh the risks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">2. Secure your accounts</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with all online accounts, it’s important to use secure, unique passwords and two-factor authentication when creating and maintaining cryptocurrency logins. Hackers can access lists of passwords and logins via the dark web, so never reuse your passwords. Two-factor authentication requires a randomly generated passcode for entry that is only accessible to you, so cybercriminals will not be able to access your accounts. If your accounts are a pain for a hacker to try to get through, they will likely move on, keeping your account, your information, and your assets safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">3. Use a crypto wallet</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For some added protection, store your assets in a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cold-wallets-hot-wallets-the-basics-of-storing-your-crypto-securely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">crypto wallet</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. A crypto wallet is a software product or physical device that stores the keys to your cryptocurrency accounts. Crypto wallets allow you to transfer funds between crypto types and make transactions while keeping your investments protected. There are various types of cryptocurrency wallets, so do your research to find which one is best for you and your accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">4. Check your accounts regularly</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Develop a routine of checking in on your crypto accounts to keep an eye on any suspicious transactions. Keep up with news outlets so that if there does happen to be a breach, you can make a timely report of any losses you may have had. For some added security and protection, consider changing your login credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">5. Be on the lookout for suspicious emails</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hackers often use social engineering to enact cyberattacks like these. This includes targeting users’ emails or using </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/staying-safer-online-from-phishing-and-other-social-engineering-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to gain access to these accounts. When receiving emails, be wary of addresses that seem slightly off, odd spelling and grammar mistakes, and any links or attachments added to the message. Being cautious and alert when you are online is an important step to ensuring your account safety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the world of crypto continues to evolve and more people get involved, cybercriminals are itching to take advantage. However, that is no reason to avoid getting into the crypto economy. If you decide to try your hand at digital currencies, make sure you are doing your research, staying up to date on what is happening in the crypto news, and remaining vigilant when it comes to your online safety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

No, we’re not talking about the ones filled with chocolate chips. We’re talking about the ones that allow you to log in to your favorite websites. Cookies may impact your online security, so check out these tips to manage them and keep your online accounts safe. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Are Cookies in Browsers? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ever wonder how a website saves the items you placed in your shopping cart last week, even though you closed the tab before making the purchase? This is made possible by cookies. According to the Federal Trade Commission, a cookie is information saved by your web browser. When you visit a website, the site may place a cookie on your web browser so it can recognize your device in the future. If you return to that site later, it can read that cookie to remember you from your last visit, keeping track of your activities over time.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">First-party vs. Third-party Cookies </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cookies come in either the first-party or third-party variety. There’s no difference between the two in how they function, but rather in where and how you encountered them. First-party cookies belong to sites you visited first-hand in your browser. Third-party cookies, or “tracking cookies,” generally come from third-party advertising websites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Magic Cookies vs. HTTP Cookies</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although cookies generally function the same, there are technically two different types of cookies. Magic cookies refer to packets of information that are sent and received without changes. Historically, this would be used to log in to a computer database system, such as an internal business  network. This concept predates the modern cookie we use today.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">HTTP cookies are a repurposed version of the magic cookie built for internet browsing and managing online experiences. HTTP cookies help web developers give you more personalized, convenient website experiences. They allow sites to remember you, your website logins, and shopping carts so you can pick back up where you left off from your last visit. However, cybercriminals can manipulate HTTP cookies to spy on your online activity and steal your personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Is Cookie Hijacking? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cookie hijacking (also known as session hijacking) is typically initiated when a cybercriminal sends you a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-spot-fake-login-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">fake login page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If you click the fake link, the thief can steal the cookie and capture anything you type while on the fraudulent website. Like a phishing attack, cookie hijacking allows a cybercriminal to steal personal information like usernames, passwords, and other important data held within the cookie. If you enter your information while on the fake website, the criminal can then put that cookie in their browser and impersonate you online. They may even change your credentials, locking you out of your account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sometimes, criminals initiate cookie hijacking attacks without a fake link. If you’re browsing on an unsecured, public Wi-Fi connection, hackers can easily steal your data that&#8217;s traveling through the connection. This can happen even if the site is secure and your username and password are encrypted.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Can Cookies Compromise Your Browser Security? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because the data in cookies doesn&#8217;t change, cookies </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">themselves</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> aren&#8217;t harmful. They can&#8217;t infect computers with viruses or malware. But if your cookies are hijacked as part of a cyberattack, a criminal could gain access to your browsing history and use cookies as the key to enter your locked accounts. For example, a hacker may steal your identity or confidential company information, purchase items in your online shopping carts, or loot your bank account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tips for a More Secure Browsing Experience</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Preventing cookie hijacking attacks can allow you to browse the internet with greater peace of mind. Follow these tips to not only safeguard your personal information but to also enhance your browsing experience: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Clean out the cookie jar </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Make it a habit to clear your cookie cache regularly to prevent cookie overload, which could slow your search speeds. Also, almost every browser has the option to enable/disable cookies on your computer. So if you don’t want them at all, your browser’s support section can walk you through how to disable them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Turn off autofill features</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although it’s convenient to not have to re-type your credentials into a website you frequently visit, autofill features could make it easier for a criminal to extract your data with cookie hijacking. Plus, autofill is risky if your physical device falls into the wrong hands. To browse more securely without having to constantly reenter your passwords, use a password manager like </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. True Key makes it so you only have to remember one master password, and it encrypts the rest in a vault protected by one of the most secure encryption algorithms available.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Opt into multi-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, updated regularly, offer ample protection against hackers. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Multi-factor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (MFA) adds yet another layer of security by double-checking your identity beyond your username and password, usually with a texted or emailed code. When your accounts offer MFA, always opt in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Connect to a virtual private network (VPN)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Criminals can hijack your cookies if you’re browsing on an unsecured, public Wi-Fi connection. To prevent a criminal from swiping your data, use a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">virtual private network</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (VPN), a service that protects your data and privacy online.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="147" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pay-Parity_3-years_main-image-300x147.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pay-Parity_3-years_main-image-300x147.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pay-Parity_3-years_main-image-205x100.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pay-Parity_3-years_main-image.png 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p style="font-weight: 400;">This month, McAfee celebrates three years of maintaining pay parity. Compensating employees equally for their contributions, regardless of gender or ethnicity, is one of the many ways we create a culture where all can belong and an environment where everyone is valued.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But equal pay sounds like a given, right?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It absolutely should be. However, unconscious bias and a slew of contributing factors, such as differences in how men and women negotiate pay raises and starting salaries, means inequality can slowly creep in across a business and become pervasive unless actively monitored. This means maintaining pay parity requires constant work and attention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the first cybersecurity company to achieve pay parity, we know first-hand the commitment involved in such an undertaking. We also know the overall impact for our employees, including greater trust, engagement, and loyalty. More than this, we believe simply, that pay parity is the right thing to do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I’m sharing more about our journey, our process, and our work to maintain pay parity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How we began</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our pay parity journey began in 2018. Few companies had achieved pay parity at the time, but we realized it was an essential part of ‘walking the walk.’ It’s well documented that diverse teams perform higher, and when employees feel seen and valued for their contributions, they are more productive and increasingly innovative.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We developed a framework and conducted our first annual audit in late 2018. At the time, McAfee had experienced various changes. We had been a public company, then acquired by a $70 billion hardware company, and later sold to private equity. The result of all this change and being a newly private company creating a new identity and standing up new programs, had led to inconsistencies. The results revealed pay disparities across nine of our 45 countries. With our Board’s full support, we were unwavering in our commitment to resolve swiftly and invest in adjusting salaries immediately to ensure full pay parity in that year. Once we dissected the data, we couldn’t wait to reach parity over time, it had to be immediate. We also had full commitment to put measures in place to maintain any pay parity ‘drift’.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Our process</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In its simplest form, we adhere to the following framework for achieving and maintaining pay parity:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><em>We define.</em> Pay parity means fair and equal pay for employees in the same job code, grade level and location, regardless of gender or ethnicity.</li>
<li><em>We analyze.</em> We first audit employee job codes for accuracy and then group employees by job code. We apply controls for pay differentiators such as performance, tenure, and experience.</li>
<li><em>We adjust<strong>.</strong></em> After meticulous evaluation with the business, we make any pay adjustments.</li>
<li><em>We uphold.</em> In addition to annual analysis, we keep parity at the forefront throughout the year—from our hiring practices to how we promote and reward our employees.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Staying the course</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining pay parity is a year-long exercise and is now part of our culture. At McAfee, we run quarterly audits and use a third-party vendor to help remove the notion of any perceived bias and subjectivity. If discrepancies are identified, we address them immediately.  It’s important to note that pay parity can change daily based on new hires coming in and market changes. So, it can’t be a once-a-year review, you have to stay on top of it to ensure your organization is at parity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also work hard to keep pay parity front of mind for people leaders and hiring managers. Through regular training on diversity topics, we remind people leaders of the science behind unconscious bias and how to overcome it. To further remove any bias, we overlay promotions, awards, and relevant employee programs with a Diversity Impact Analysis to ensure allocation of awards is statistically aligned to the diverse population of that team or organization.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the combination of these efforts that resulted in an exciting milestone: our latest independent audit revealed no disparity. This tells us our commitment to equality permeates our culture. The absence of any discrepancies did not happen by accident – it&#8217;s the result of intentional focus from our leaders, recruitment team, and hiring managers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What the future holds</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since we began our journey three years ago, the world has experienced tremendous change and challenging times – some may feel more divided than united. This makes our commitment to pay parity and building an inclusive culture even more important.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We will continue to maintain parity, ask what we can do better, and share the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/executive-perspectives/championing-equality-mcafee-to-achieve-gender-pay-parity-in-2019">best practices</a> we continue to follow, as well as learnings along the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/"><span data-contrast="none">A new industry standard called Matter aims to remove a big barrier in smart home technology</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, one that makes different smart home devices compatible with any smart home platform—something that wasn’t possible until now.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For years, different smart home devices have run on several different competing platforms, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, or Samsung SmartThings. And put plainly, those different platforms didn’t work with each other. And that was unfortunate. After all, the vision for the smart home was to run everything from lights, appliances, doorbell cameras, and all kinds of connected things in your home from a central set of controls, regardless of device manufacturer or platform.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But that hasn’t been the case, and this lack of compatibility created some headaches for homeowners. They’ve had to choose between one smart home platform over another and then only use smart devices built for that platform. </span><span data-contrast="none">For example, if you’re running a bunch of devices on Apple HomeKit and find a great deal on a new Samsung smart refrigerator with Alexa built-in, you’re pretty much out of luck if you want those devices to all work together as one in your smart home. The result is that consumers have had to check the fine print to see what’s compatible with what when shopping for smart devices. Again, a real headache.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Matter aims to take care of that. It’s hailed as a unifying technology that will make all those devices work together. Right now, the first wave of Matter-enabled devices is on track for a mid-year launch, which means we may finally see that vision of a smart home come true—a place where all your connected stuff works together with just the sound of your voice or a tap on your phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that, let’s take a closer look at the new Matter protocol and what it offers, along with a look at security and privacy for smart home devices in general.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Security and privacy in your smart home</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, the idea is exciting. What remains to be seen is how security and privacy matters are handled, not only by the network but by the devices on it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As far as security goes, </span><a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Matter uses a combination of encryption and blockchain technology to secure transmitted data and ensure that only the devices you trust can use the network</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Considering that you may be heating your home, warming up your oven, or even locking your front door, security features like these only make sense. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet looking beyond Matter and thinking about connected homes more broadly, there are a few question marks when it comes to privacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Imagine for a moment what a highly connected home might look like—and all the data those connections will generate. That data will show what time of day your front door tends to unlock and lock when family members go to and from work, school, or what have you. It’ll also show when you tend to turn on your lights, cook your dinner, or turn on the house alarm for the night. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Over time, all this data can piece together a picture of your comings and goings during a typical week. Shy of a bad actor physically casing out your home over several days, data like this simply hasn’t existed until the age of the connected home. If that data goes unprotected or if the devices creating it don’t give you some control over it, the privacy risks will run high. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Moreover, data privacy policies come into play here as well. As consumers like us are very much aware these days, not every company treats your data the same way. Some companies have different policies around what data they may collect and then what they do with that data—like cloud sites for other smart devices, government agencies, insurance companies, law enforcement, data aggregators, data banks, social media sites, and others </span><a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2020/five-common-privacy-problems-in-an-era-of-smart-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">according to findings published by some industry groups</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. In a smart home that’s kitted out with devices from five, seven, or even more different manufacturers, that are multiple privacy policies in play—each of which may view and treat your private data in their own way. That’s potentially volumes of your data circulating out there, potentially in ways you aren’t aware of or that give you any control over its use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Of course, the issue of data privacy is nothing new and certainly not specific to smart devices. Already, the dozens of different apps and services we use as we go about our day have their own data privacy policies as well. Devices in a smart home only add to that mix, which is worth considering in our already highly connected lives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your smart home</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As I write this, Matter has yet to be released. Yet if you already have some smart devices in your home, you may be wondering how to make your connected home safer. Let’s take a look at a few of the things you can do to protect your smart devices and the home network they’re running on.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Grab online protection for your smartphone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many smart home devices use a smartphone as a sort of remote control, not to mention as a place for gathering, storing, and sharing data. So whether you’re an </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Android</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> owner or </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">iOS</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> owner, protect your smartphone so you can protect the things it accesses and controls—and the data stored on it too. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Set strong, unique passwords for your smart home devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Early on when the first sets of smart home devices rolled out, some found themselves open to attack because they come with a default username and password, which hackers often publish on the internet as part of massive listings. (</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/06/05/617196788/s-c-mom-says-baby-monitor-was-hacked-experts-say-many-devices-are-vulnerable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Baby monitors are a classic example</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.) And it remains an issue today. When you purchase any IoT device, set a fresh password using </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a strong method of password creation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Likewise, create an entirely new username for additional protection as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Secure your internet router too</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another device that needs good password protection is your internet router. Make sure you use </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a strong and unique password </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">there as well to help prevent hackers from breaking into your home network. (</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html#:~:text=Firewall-,Password%20manager,-Securely%20store%20and" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A password manager as part of comprehensive online protection can help</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.) Also, consider changing the same of your home network so that it doesn’t personally identify you. (I’ve seen some fun alternatives to using your name or address, everything from movie lines like “May the Wi-Fi be with you” to old sitcom references like “Central Perk.”) Also check that your router is using an encryption method, like WPA2, which will keep your signal secure. If you haven’t done this sort of thing before, check the documentation that came with your router or with the internet provider if you rent or purchased it from them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use multi-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Online banks, shops, and other services commonly offer </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/authentication-methods-101/?hilite=%27two-factor%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">multi-factor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to help protect your accounts—with the typical combination of your username, password, and a security code sent to another device you own (often a mobile phone). If your IoT device supports multi-factor authentication, consider using it there too. It throws a big barrier in the way hackers simply try and force their way in with a password/username combination, which will make your device tougher to crack. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Update your devices regularly</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to fixing the odd bug or adding the occasional new feature, app and device updates often address security gaps. Out-of-date apps and devices may have flaws that hackers can exploit, so regular updating is a must from a security standpoint. If you can set your smart home apps and devices to receive automatic updates, even better.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Looking ahead to your connected home</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Smart homes show plenty of promise. Seeing a new and broadly adopted industry standard like Matter on the horizon may make them even more promising. Ideally, Matter will make it easier for people to bring more smart devices in their homes, and in a way that’s reliable and secure. Moreover, there are steps you can take now to help keep your smart home devices, and smart home in general, more secure as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet when it comes to thinking about a home full of smart devices, questions around privacy remain. Smart home devices offered by different manufacturers will have different privacy policies and thus use people’s data in different ways, which puts consumers like us in a position to understand the terms, conditions, and implications of each one. Yet with data privacy being such a hot topic for consumers, the industry, and regulators already, it remains to be seen what consumer-friendly standards are set for data collection in the years to come—both in and out of the smart home.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Topping the several important things a new cryptocurrency investor needs to think about is security. Rightfully so. Cryptocurrency is indeed subject to all kinds of fraud, theft, and phishing attacks, just like the credentials and accounts we keep online. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But here’s the catch. </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">L</span><span data-contrast="none">ost or stolen cryptocurrency is terrifically difficult to recover</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. By and large, it doesn’t enjoy the same protections and regulations as traditional currency and financial transactions. For example, you can always call your bank or credit card company to report theft or contest a fraudulent charge. Not the case with crypto. With that, you’ll absolutely need a safe place to secure it. Likewise, </span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/#:~:text=Deposits%20are%20insured%20up%20to,through%20the%20date%20of%20default." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">in the U.S. many banks are FDIC insured</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which protects depositors if the bank fails. Again, not so with crypto.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, when it comes to cryptocurrency, security is everything.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What makes crypto so attractive to hackers?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Cryptocurrency theft offers hackers an immediate payoff. It’s altogether different from, say, hacking the database of a Fortune 500 company. With a data breach, a hacker may round up armloads of personal data and information, yet it takes additional steps for them to translate those stolen records into money. With cryptocurrency theft, the dollars shift from the victim to the crook in milliseconds. It’s like digital pickpocketing. As you can guess, that makes cryptocurrency a big target.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s where your wallet will come in, a place where you store the digital credentials associated with the cryptocurrency you own. The issue is doing it securely. Let’s take a look at the different wallets out there and then talk about how you can secure them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Hot wallets and cold wallets for crypto</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Broadly, there are two general categories of wallets. First, let’s look at what these wallets store.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A wallet contains public and private “keys” that are used to conduct transactions. The public key often takes the form of an address, one that anyone can see and then use to send cryptocurrency. The private key is exactly that. Highly complex and taking many forms that range from multi-word phrases to strings of code, it’s your unique key that proves your ownership of your cryptocurrency and that allows you to spend and send crypto. Needless to say, never share your private key. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that, there are two ways to store your keys—in a hot wallet or a cold wallet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">In addition to that, a hot wallet is connected to a cryptocurrency exchange, which makes the transfer of cryptocurrencies possible. The issue with that is all cryptocurrency exchanges are not created equal, particularly when it comes to security. Some of the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/crypto-scammers-took-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-chainalysis.html#:~:text=Losses%20from%20crypto%2Drelated%20crime,were%20taken%20from%20DeFi%20protocols." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">lesser-established exchanges may not utilize strong protocols</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, likely making a target for attack. </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/bitcoin-crypto-exchange-hacks-little-anyone-can-do-rcna7870" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Even the more established and trusted exchanges have fallen victim to attacks—where crooks have walked away with millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Cold wallets for cryptocurrency</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While the funds in cold wallets are far less liquid, they’re far more secure because they’re not connected to the internet. In this way, cold wallets are more vault-like and suitable for long-term storage of larger sums of funds. But cold wallets place a great deal of responsibility on the holder. They must be stored in a physically secure place, and be backed up, because if you lose that one device or printout that contains your cryptocurrency info, you lose the cryptocurrency altogether. Within the cold wallet category, there are a few different types:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Purpose-built cryptocurrency storage devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Several manufacturers make storage devices specifically designed to store cryptocurrency, complete with specific features for security, durability, and compatibility with many (yet not always all) of the different cryptocurrencies on the market. An online search will turn up several options, so doing your homework here will be very important—such as which devices have the best track record for security, which devices are the most reliable overall, and which ones are compatible with the crypto you wish to keep. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Hard drives on a computer or laptop</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Storing cryptocurrency information on a computer or laptop that’s disconnected from the internet (also known as “air-gapped”) is a storage method that’s been in place for some time. However, because computers and laptops are complex devices, they may be less secure than a simpler, purpose-built cryptocurrency device. In short, there are more ways to compromise a computer or laptop with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08714.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">malware that a determined hacker can use to steal information in some rather surprising ways</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. (Like noise from a compromised computer fan passing information in a sort of Morse Code or generating electromagnetic signals on a compromised computer that nearby devices can use to skim information.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Ah, good old paper. Write down a code and keep it secure. Simple, right? In truth, creating a paper wallet can be one of the most involved methods of all the cold storage options out there. </span><a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/setting-up-your-own-cold-storage-bitcoin-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Bitcoin offers a step-by-step walkthrough of the process that you can see for yourself</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Once done, though, you’ll have a piece of paper with a public address for loading cryptocurrency into your paper cold wallet, along with a private key. One note: Bitcoin and others recommend never reusing a paper cold wallet once it’s connected to a hot wallet. You should go through the process of creating a new cold paper wallet each time. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Physical coins are a special case and are relatively new on the scene. They’re a physical coin minted with a tamper-resistant sticker that indicates the actual value of the coin. Like other methods of cold wallet storage, this calls for keeping it in a safe place, because it’s pretty much like a wad of cash. And like cash, if it’s stolen, it’s gone for good. Also note that a cryptocurrency holder must work with a third party to mint and deliver the coin, which has its own costs and risks involved.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Securing your cryptocurrency wallet</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that look at wallets, let’s see what it takes to secure them. It may seem like there’s plenty to do here. That’s because there is, which goes to show just how much responsibility falls on the shoulders of the cryptocurrency holder. Of course, this is your money we’re talking about, so let’s dive into the details.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Back up your wallet</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Whatever form your storage takes, back it up. And back it up again. Cryptocurrency holders should make multiple copies just in case one is lost, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible. For example, one story that’s made the rounds is of </span><a href="https://www.deseret.com/2021/12/10/22827963/james-howells-threw-away-hard-drives-with-bitcoin-password" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a IT engineer in the UK who accidentally threw away an old hard drive with his cryptocurrency key on it,</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> one that held 7,500 bitcoins, worth millions of dollars. Redundancy is key. Back up the entire wallet right away and then often after that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Store your wallet(s) securely </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With redundant backups in place, store them in places that are physically secure. It’s not uncommon for crypto holders to use fireproof safes and safe deposit boxes at banks for this purpose, which only highlights the earlier point that a wallet is as good as cash in many ways.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Use online protection software </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This will help prevent malware from stealing crypto, whether or not your device is connected to the internet. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software will give you plenty of other benefits as well</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, including identity theft monitoring and strong password management, two things that can help you protect your investments, and yourself, even further.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Update your operating system, apps, and devices </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Updates often address security issues, ones that hackers will of course try to exploit. Keep everything current and set automatic updates wherever they are available so that you have the latest and greatest.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5. Make use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just as your bank and other financial accounts offer MFA, do the same here with your crypto. Some extra security-conscious crypto investors will purchase a device for this specific purpose for yet greater protection, such as a separate phone with texting capability. This keeps their crypto transactions separate from the multitude of other things they do on their everyday smartphone, effectively putting up a wall between these two different digital worlds. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">6. Keep your investments to yourself</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none"> Two things fall under this category. One, the less you say about the crypto investments you make, the less word gets around, which can help keep hackers out of the loop. Particularly on social media! Two, consider setting up a unique email account that you only use for crypto. The less you associate your crypto accounts with other financial accounts like your banking and online payment apps, the more difficult it is to compromise several accounts in one fell swoop. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7. Watch out for phishing scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just like hackers send phishing emails with an eye on accessing your bank accounts, credit cards, and so on, they’ll do much the same to get at your crypto accounts. The target may be different, that being your crypto, but the attack is very much the same. An email will direct you to a hacker’s website, using some sort of phony pretense, get-rich-quick-scheme, or scare tactic. Once there, they’ll ask for private key information and then simply steal the funds. And it’s not just email. </span><a href="https://money.com/crypto-phishing-google-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Hackers have used online ads to phish for victims as well</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Crypto: security is on you</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As you can see, these security measures rely almost exclusively on you. If something happens to you, that could make recovering your funds a real problem. Consider reaching out to someone you trust and let them know where you’re storing your wallets and information. That way, you’ll have some assistance ready in the event of an emergency or issue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The very things that define cryptocurrency—the anonymity of ownership, the lack of banking institutions, the light or non-existent regulation—all have major security implications. Add in the fact that you’re your own safety net here and it’s easy to see that crypto is something that requires plenty of planning and careful through before diving into. Getting knowledgeable about security, how you’ll protect your crypto, should absolutely top your list before investing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hackers have been stealing and reselling online gaming accounts for some time now. Yet </span><a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/fraudsters-shift-focus-at-mid-point-of-2021-from-financial-services--to-travel-and-leisure-and-other-industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the recent 400 percent rise in online gaming theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> shouldn’t come as a surprise, particularly as so many of us turned to games for entertainment lately. As people leveled up, gathered loot, and filled their libraries with games in the cloud, hackers saw the opportunity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The opportunity is this: gaming accounts have a street value. The virtual items and perks we acquire through gaming take time, effort, participation, and sometimes just good luck to build up. In a way, we’ve worked hard to earn our fun. Meanwhile, others out there are willing to take a shortcut. There are those who’ll pay for a well-stocked gaming account that someone else has built up, and hackers are more than willing to hijack accounts from innocent victims and sell them online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Put simply, the virtual goods in your gaming accounts are like any other good. They have value. And just like anything else you value, they’re worth protecting. That’s exactly what we’ll help you do here. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Sanctioned markets, gray markets, and dark markets: Where gaming goods are sold</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First up, let’s take a quick look at the different ways digital goods get moved and sold out there—just to get a sense of the marketplaces that have cropped up around gaming and where hackers fit into the mix.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And there are several. Over the years we’ve seen all kinds of gaming marketplaces crop up, whether they’re sanctioned marketplaces built inside of online games, gray marketplaces that exist outside of games, and dark marketplaces where stolen accounts and goods are exchanged.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Sanctioned marketplaces</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a gamer, you’re likely familiar with any number of sanctioned auction houses and marketplaces that are built right into online games, all designed and supported by the game’s developers. A classic example is the long-running auction house in World of Warcraft where players can buy and sell items with in-game currency, the World of Warcraft gold piece. And as marketplaces can go, the rarer and more coveted the item, the higher the price the seller can get for it. In fact, </span><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Working_the_Auction_House" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">there are plenty of articles on how to play the markets for profit, in a quasi-stock market-like fashion</span></a>, <span data-contrast="auto">and all within the legitimate boundaries of the game. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In recent years, we’ve also seen the rise of in-game currencies that players can purchase for cash, again by design and with the support of the developer. A couple of examples are the </span><a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/31218" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">World of Warcraft Tokens</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408963926541-Marketplace-FAQs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Minecraft tokens and coins</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. What you can do with such tokens and coins varies from game to game, yet players can use them to acquire in-game currency, items, or paid to play time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Increasingly common are in-game stores that allow players to purchase items and perks with cash, just like any other online store. Taken together with all the other ways a player can round up items in a game, it’s easy to see how a gamer’s account can grow into something somewhat unique and valuable over time, simply by playing and participating in the game.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Gray market “boosters” and other services for cash</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the time it takes for a player to level up a powerful character and acquire the items that can come along with it, there are out-of-game organizations that will, for a fee, do that work for a player in return for payment. Essentially it involves a player starting a gaming account, rolling up a character, and then handing over the account to a “booster” who will play the game on the owner’s behalf. When the agreed-upon level is reached, the booster hands back the character to the owner.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, there are all kinds of potential problems with this. Strictly from a security standpoint, this means an account owner is handing over their credentials to a stranger, with no real guarantee that this stranger simply won’t change the account password, never hand back the account, and simply walk away with any funds that may have been paid upfront.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Further, “boosting” and other similar services may be against the user agreement the player signed when joining up for the game. For example, </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/policy-update-for-organized-in-game-services-january-2022/1176836"><span data-contrast="none">World of Warcraft recently updated its policy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, stating that they now,</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while “boosting” services may not be illegal themselves, they can run counter to user agreements and may lead to cases of fraud when a booster service fails to fulfill its commitment or simply locks a player out of their own account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then there’s the theft and resale of online game accounts, clear examples of digital goods illegally changing hands. Stolen accounts make their way into dark web marketplaces and ads on chat platforms and social media, thanks to hackers who’ve cracked previously legitimate accounts and then packaged them up for sale. In some instances, cybercriminals will sell entire game collections, such as online gaming platform accounts where gamers may have purchased and have access to dozens and dozens of games stored in the cloud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The method behind this theft is much like a credit card or bank account hack. Often using credentials lifted from a data breach, hackers will take known usernames and passwords and feed them into a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">credential stuffing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> application—which can then attempt to access hundreds, even thousands, of accounts through automated login requests. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that many users out there use the same passwords across their accounts makes them an easy target for this practice and can reap a large harvest of cracked accounts. From there, the account can be accessed, have its password changed, and then made ready for advertising and sale, where an account can be resold for a few dollars, or for potentially thousands depending on what the account contains. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting your online gaming account from getting hacked</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s plenty you can do. A few simple steps on your part can drop some serious roadblocks in the way of a hacker who’s looking to crack your account or target you for a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Passwords, passwords, passwords </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Each of your accounts should have its own strong, unique password. No repeats. And if you have some sixty-plus accounts across all the shopping, banking, gaming, and forum posting you do, not to mention your apps, that sounds like a lot of work. Because it is. Although it doesn’t have to be. A password manager can do the work for you by creating and storing strong, unique passwords for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. News of a data breach? Change your password </span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/what-to-do-if-youre-caught-up-in-a-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Data breaches happen all the time now, striking businesses both large and small</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If a business or organization where you have an online account gets breached, change your password right away. Related to the above, make sure the passwords across your other accounts are strong and unique. It’s not uncommon for hackers to try breaching passwords in other accounts, all in the hope that the victim is using the same or a similar password on other accounts as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Multifactor your defense </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Several gaming services offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a means of protecting accounts. In addition to requiring a username and password to log in, MFA further verifies account activity by sending a unique code to the email address or text to a device you own, which makes gaining illegal access that much tougher for hackers. Some gaming platforms even support </span><a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/24520" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">an authentication app, such as the Battle.net Authenticator</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, offered by Blizzard. In all, the occasional extra clicks required by MFA can really save you some massive headaches by preventing theft. If you have MFA as an option, strongly consider using it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Don’t feed the phish </span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing attacks have made the jump from email to </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/why-scammers-have-flocked-to-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">bogus ads on social media an</span><span data-contrast="none">d in search too</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In short, a phishing attack involves the hacker posing as a well-known company or organization with the intent of fooling you into providing your username and password. With that, they can drain your account, whether it’s money from your bank account or goods in your gaming account. Spotting phishing attacks can call for a sharp eye nowadays because </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-spot-fake-login-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">some hackers can make the phishing emails and sites they use look like the real thing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Comprehensive online protection software will include web protection that can spot bogus links and sites and warn you away from them, even if they look legit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Watch out for &#8220;spearphishers&#8221;, too </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Spearphishers are a special sort, in that they make more targeted attacks. While a phisher will send out an email blast or attempt to rope in a high volume of victims with an ad, a spearphisher will send a direct message to specific, potential victims. You may have seen or heard of this in massively multiplayer online games where an otherwise unknown player sends a message to another with a link to a website, complete with the promise of loot, in-game currency, or services to level up characters. Ignore and don’t visit that link. Chances are it’s a scammer, or at least someone who may be breaking the game’s user agreement by offering such services. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Mods and malware</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you’re downloading a mod, an expansion, or a new game itself, go with a reputable online store or source. Hackers will drop malware into all kinds of files and applications, games included. Given that such malware could log keystrokes that steal login info, inject ransomware code to hold your device and data hostage, or simply wreak havoc on your files and things, it can have implications for more than just your gaming accounts and the virtual assets you have with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Play defense</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hackers know there’s good money in gaming accounts. They wouldn’t bother with them otherwise. Realizing that your gaming account has value is the first step to protecting it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to taking the steps above, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">consider comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It offers defense in breadth and depth, covering everything from device security, privacy, and identity protection. However, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/gaming.html"><span data-contrast="none">if you want an even faster and safer gaming experience, gamer security is worth looking into</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition to strong security features, it also offers performance-enhancing technologies that prioritize system resources and keep your gameplay going smooth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, keep in mind that gaming accounts are serious business for hackers. Put up your defenses. Then get out and enjoy yourself, knowing that you have made it far, far tougher for them to ruin your fun.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>Scammers are very quick at reacting to current events, so they can generate ill-gotten gains. It comes as no surprise that they exploited the current events in Ukraine, and when the Ukrainian Twitter account tweeted Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses for donations we knew that scammers would use this as a lure for their victims.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149479" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr1.png" alt="" width="404" height="274" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr1.png 404w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr1-300x203.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr1-190x129.png 190w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p>This blog covers some of the malicious sites and emails McAfee has observed in the past few weeks.</p>
<h3><strong>Crypto wallet donation scams</strong></h3>
<p>A crypto donation scam occurs when perpetrators create phishing websites and emails that contain cryptocurrency wallets asking for donations. We have observed several new domains being created which perform this malicious activity, such as ukrainehelp[.]world and ukrainethereum[.]com.</p>
<h4>Ukrainhelp[.]world</h4>
<p>Below is a screenshot of Ukrainehelp[.]world, which is a phishing site asking for crypto donations for UNICEF. The website contains the BBC logo and several crypto wallet addresses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-149507 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr2.png" alt="" width="480" height="301" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr2.png 480w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr2-300x188.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ukr2-205x129.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>While investigating this site, we observed that the Ethereum wallet used use was also associated with an older crypto scam site called eth-event20.com. The image below shows the current value of the crypto wallet which is worth $114,000. Interestingly this wallet transfers all its coins to 0xc95eb2aa75260781627e7171c679a490e2240070 which in turn transfers to 0x45fb09468b17d14d2b9952bc9dcb39ee7359e64d. The final wallet currently has 313 ETH which is worth over $850,000. This shows the large sums of money scammers can generate with phishing sites.</p>

<h4>Ukrainethereum[.]com</h4>
<p>Ukrainethereum[.]com is another crypto scam site, but what makes this one interesting is the features it contains to gain the victim&#8217;s confidence in trusting the website such as a fake chatbox and a fake donation verifier.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149569" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="640" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh-293x300.jpg 293w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh-126x129.jpg 126w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh-24x24.jpg 24w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uketh-48x48.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Fake Chat</h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-149655 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/urk5.png" alt="" width="779" height="450" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/urk5.png 779w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/urk5-300x173.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/urk5-768x444.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/urk5-205x118.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px" /></p>

It’s time for spring cleaning.</p>
<p>And that goes for your digital stuff too.</p>
<p>Whether it’s indeed spring where you are or not, you can give your devices, apps, and online accounts a good decluttering. Now’s the time. Cleaning them up can protect your privacy and your identity, because when there’s less lying about, there’s less for hackers to scoop up and exploit.</p>
<p>The reality is that we accumulate plenty of digital clutter that needs cleaning up from time to time. Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bunches of one-off accounts at online stores we won’t frequent again.</li>
<li>Membership in messages board or forums you no longer drop in on.</li>
<li>Plenty of outdated apps and programs that are still sitting on your devices.</li>
<li>Aging files that are no longer relevant, like spreadsheets and records from years ago.</li>
<li>And photos—oh, photos! We have plenty of those, right?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Seven steps for digital spring cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>Together, these things take up space on your devices and, in some cases, can open you up to security hazards. Let’s take a look at how you can clean up in a few steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Review your accounts and delete the ones you don’t use.</strong> Look through your bookmarks, your password manager, or the other places where you store your passwords and usernames. Review the sites and services associated with them critically. If you haven’t used an account in some time, log in one last time, remove all personal info, and deactivate it.</p>
<p>Doing so can keep your email address, usernames, and passwords out of unnecessary circulation. Major breaches <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/shinyhunters-exposes-over-125-million-online-credentials/?hilite=%27shiny%27">like this one</a> happen with unfortunate regularity, and the sad thing is that you may not even be aware that a site you’ve used has been hit. Meanwhile, your name, password, and info associated with that account (such as your credit card) are in the hands of hackers. Limit your exposure. Close those old accounts.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get organized, and safer too, with a password manager.</strong> While <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27">creating strong, unique passwords for each of our accounts</a> is a must nowadays, it can be quite the feat, given all of the accounts in our lives. Here’s where <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/why-do-i-need-a-password-manager/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27">a password manager</a> comes in. It can create those strong, unique passwords for you. Not only that, but it also stores your passwords on secure servers, away from hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Along those lines, never store your passwords on your computer or device, like a text document or spreadsheet. Should your device ever get compromised, lost, or stolen, having passwords stored on them are like handing over the keys to your digital life.</p>
<p><strong>3. Clean your PC to improve your performance (and your security).</strong> Let’s face it, so many of us are so busy with the day-to-day that cleaning up our computers and laptops is way down the list. However, doing so once a month can keep our devices running stronger for longer and even give you that “new computer feeling,” particularly if you haven’t cleaned it up for some time. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/does-pc-cleaning-improve-performance">Check out or guide for improving PC performance</a>. It’ll walk you through some straightforward steps that can make a marked difference.</p>
<p>Moreover, part of this process should entail bolstering your operating system and apps with the latest updates. Such updates can not only improve speed and functionality, but they also often include security upgrades as well that can make you safer in the long run. If your operating system and apps feature automatic updates, enable them, and they’ll do the work for you.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Organize and store your photos.</strong> Photos. Now there’s a topic all unto itself. Here’s the thing: Estimates show that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/12-trillion-photos-to-be-taken-in-2017-thanks-to-smartphones-chart-2017-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worldwide we took somewhere around 1.2 trillion photos in 2018</a>. And you certainly have your share.</p>
<p>However, your photos may be just sitting there, taking up storage space on your computer or phone, instead of becoming something special like an album, greeting cards, a wall hanging, or popping them into a digital picture frame for your kitchen or living room. And this is where a little spring cleaning can be a bit of fun. For tips on cleaning up your photos, backing them up, and making something special with them, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/entertainment-fromhome-photo-backups-digital-picture-frames-and-more/?hilite=%27photos%27">check out my earlier blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Delete old apps and the data associated with them.</strong> Let’s say you have a couple of apps on your phone for tracking your walks, runs, and exercise. You’ve since stopped using one altogether. Go ahead and delete the old one. But before you do, go in and delete your account associated with the app to ensure that any data stored off your phone, along with your password and user id are deleted as well.</p>
<p>For your computers and laptops, follow the same procedure, recognizing that they also may have account data stored elsewhere other than on your device.</p>
<p>In short, many apps today store information that’s stored and maintained by the app provider. Make sure you close your accounts so that data and information is taken out of circulation as well.</p>
<p><strong>6. Shred your old files and encrypt the important files you’re holding on to.</strong> This bit of advice calls for using comprehensive security software on your devices. In addition to protecting you from viruses, malware, and other cyberattacks on your privacy and identity, it can help you protect your sensitive information as well. Such security software can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>File encryption, which renders your most sensitive files into digital gibberish without the encryption key to translate them back.</li>
<li>A digital file shredder that permanently deletes old files from your computer (simply dropping them into the desktop trashcan doesn’t do that—those files can be easily recovered).</li>
<li>Identity theft protection, which monitors the dark web for your personal info that might have been leaked online and immediately alerts you if you might be at risk of fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Throwing away old computers and tech—dispose of properly.</strong> When it comes time to say goodbye to an old friend, whether that’s a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet, do so in a way that’s friendly to the environment and your security.</p>
<p>Consider this … what’s on that old hard drive of yours? That old computer may contain loads of precious personal and financial info on it. Same thing goes for your tablets and phones. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers some straightforward advice in their article about <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-data-you-get-rid-your-computer">protecting your data before you get rid of your computer</a>. You don’t want those old tax returns ending up in the trash unprotected.</p>
<p>When it comes time for disposal, you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into the e-waste disposal options in your community. There are services that will dispose of and recycle old technology while doing it in a secure manner.</li>
<li>Some mobile carriers have turn-in programs that will not only dispose of your tech properly, but they’ll give you a financial incentive too—such as money towards a new device.</li>
<li>Lastly, consider the option of reusing the device. There are opportunities to pass it along to a family member or even donating it as well. Your old tech may be a game-changer for someone else. Again, just be sure to protect that old data!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>As with any spring cleaning, you’ll be glad you did it</strong></h3>
<p>Enjoying the benefits of your work—that’s what spring cleaning is all about, right? With this little list, you can end up with a digital life that’s safer and faster than before.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The fact is that plenty of our information is out there on the internet, simply because we go about so much of our day online, whether that involves shopping, banking, getting results from our doctors, or simply hopping online to play a game once in a while. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As to what gets exposed and when you might find out about it, that can vary greatly as well. One industry research report found that </span><a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/how-to-minimize-your-mean-time-to-detect-a-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">60% of breaches were discovered in just days from the initial attack while others could take months or even longer detect</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Needless to say, the timeline can get rather stretched before word reaches you, which is a good reason to change your passwords regularly should any of them get swept up in a breach. (An outdated password does a hacker no good—more on that in a bit.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The answer is plenty. In all, personal information like that listed above has a dollar value to it. In a way, your data and information are a kind of currency because they’re tied to everything from your bank accounts, investments, insurance payments—even tax returns and personal identification like driver’s licenses. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/whats-the-difference-between-identity-fraud-and-identity-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With this information in hand, a crook can commit several types of identity crimes—ranging from fraud to theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In the case of fraud, that could include running up a bill on one of your credits cards or draining one of your bank accounts. In the case of theft, that could see crooks impersonate you so they can open new accounts or services in your name. Beyond that, they may attempt to claim your tax refund or potentially get an ID issued in your name as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another possibility is that a hacker will simply sell that information on the dark marketplace, perhaps in large clumps or as individual pieces of information that go for a few dollars each. However it gets sold, these dark-market practices allow other fraudsters and thieves to take advantage of your identity for financial or another gain. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The succinct answer is to sign up for an identity protection service.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you spot unusual or unfamiliar charges or transactions in your account, bank, or debit card statements, follow up immediately. That could indicate improper use.

Go to the Photos app on your phone and look at the total number of videos and images on your device – all those precious memories of family vacations, clips from your favorite concert, and countless snapshots of your furry companion. Next, open your laptop or desktop and check to see how many documents you have saved — perhaps all the research reports you have saved to defend your graduate thesis or an important slideshow you’re presenting to your boss on Monday. If you had to guess, would you say the total number of these various pieces of data is into the thousands? Now imagine if all this data was suddenly gone. What would you do? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You might be thinking, “That will never happen to me.” However, this situation is more common than you think. More than 60 million computers will fail worldwide this year, and over 200,000 smartphones are lost or stolen every year. That’s why we’re celebrating <a href="https://worldbackupday.com/en">World Backup Day</a> by sharing how you can properly back up your files and find peace of mind knowing that your data is safe and sound.</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What Are Backups and Why Are They Important?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A backup is a separate copy of your important and sentimental digital files and information. Storing all that data in one place, like a personal computer or smartphone, can prove unsafe. Creating another copy of that data through a backup will ensure that it’s stored and kept safe somewhere else should your device get wiped or stolen.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s important to recognize that data loss isn’t something that only happens to huge corporations or unsuspecting victims in spy movies. Everyone is susceptible to data loss or theft and backing up that data is an easy step to protect all your information and prevent cybercriminals from taking what isn’t theirs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Data Storage 101</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Data is one of the most important assets in the modern world. As we illustrated earlier, people collect countless files that contain valuable information they want to keep safe. Luckily, there are two common and inexpensive ways that a user can store their data and their ever-important backups. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Cloud storage </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Although “the cloud” became a major buzzword years ago, its definition is still cloudy for some folks. The cloud exists in remote data centers that you can access via the internet. Any data you’ve uploaded to the cloud exists on dedicated servers and storage volumes housed in distant warehouses, often situated on campuses full of such warehouses. Data centers are owned by cloud service providers, who are responsible for keeping the servers up and running. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">To keep your data physically safe from theft and destruction, and to make sure it’s available whenever you want to access it, data centers run extensive cooling systems to keep the electronics from overheating and have at least one backup generator in case of power outages. But how do they make sure that this data is secure in the cybersphere? Cloud systems use authentication processes like usernames and passwords to limit access, and data encryption to protect data that is stolen or intercepted. However, it’s important to remember that passwords can be hacked. Typically, the service provider holds the encryption keys to your data, meaning that rogue employees could, theoretically, access it. Likewise, your data could also potentially be searched and seized by government entities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This begs the question: Trust or don’t trust? Because cloud storage companies live and die by their reputation, you can rest assured knowing that they go to great lengths to use the most advanced security techniques and provide the most reliable service possible. To help ensure the security of your data should you choose to store or back it up to the cloud, keep anything truly sensitive in a private cloud behind a firewall. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">External hard drive </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With an external hard drive, you can manually back up all your data and files yourself onto a physical device that you can access anytime. These drives are a reliable way to achieve data redundancy. An external hard drive doesn’t rely on internet access like cloud-based services and is an easy fix when transferring data to a new device. However, using external hard drives requires a more hands-on approach to backing up your data. It’s your responsibility to regularly perform backups yourself and store your hard drive in a safe location. While cloud solutions offer huge amounts of storage, storage space on hard drives are limited, so you may have to purchase more than one device. Look for an external drive with at least a terabyte of space to accommodate all your data, which tends to accumulate quickly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you’re cleaning out your garage and tidying up your home, take the same care to do some digital spring cleaning this World Backup Day. Give your devices, apps, and online accounts a good decluttering and gain more peace of mind knowing that all your valuable data is stored in a safe, secure place &#8230; and that you have a backup in case something goes awry. Remember, proactivity goes a long way toward shoring up your cybersecurity and protecting your information.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

I was 21, had just finished university and was beyond excited at the idea of driving around in my red Mazda 121 (bubble car) making calls on my new fancy phone! The fact that it was the size of a brick, didn’t bother me a bit – I was connected!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Without a doubt, mobile phones have completely changed our expectations of being connected and contactable. If calls or texts are not promptly returned in 2022, the lack of reply may be interpreted as rude or, worst case – the sender may feel that they’ve been ghosted!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, in our super-connected society, it’s inevitable that our kids want to get in on the action. But when is the right time to give them a phone of their own? And how can you keep them safe?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Research Shows Nearly 50% of Aussie kids aged 6-13 Access A Mobile Phone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2020, the Australian Communications and Media Authority released a report, entitled </span><a href="https://www.acma.gov.au/publications/2020-12/report/kids-and-mobiles-how-australian-children-are-using-mobile-phones" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Kids and Mobiles: how Australian children are using mobile phones</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which found that in 2020, just under half (46%) of Aussie children aged 6 to 13 used a mobile phone. 33% of children owned the phone they used while the remaining 14% used a device that didn’t belong to them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The research also showed that playing games, taking photos/videos, and using apps were the most common activities undertaken on a mobile phone. Using the phone to communicate via text messages and calling a parent or family member was also a common activity – and actually increased in the three years prior.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And if your tweens and teens are telling you that &#8220;everyone has a phone&#8221; then it looks like they are on the money, with the report revealing that 76% of 12- and 13-year-olds own their own devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How To Decide When The Time Is Right?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, there are many factors that need to be considered when making this big decision. You need to take into account your child’s maturity, their technology habits, and most importantly, your gut instinct &#8211; one of the most powerful parenting tools, in my opinion! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And please, don’t think that is a one size fits all answer here because there absolutely isn’t. If there is one thing parenting 4 boys has taught me is that not only does each child have different strengths, but they mature at their own pace. So, when considering whether your child is ready, don’t think about their age. Instead, ask yourself whether they can handle the technology properly and robust enough to navigate the tricky stuff. A naïve 14-year-old with low social awareness may not be as ready as a savvy 12-year-old who has previously demonstrated successful problem-solving skills.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let me share my biggest piece of advice – before you put that phone into your child’s hand, PLEASE set the ground rules. Their willingness to co-operate will be vastly reduced once the phone is theirs! Some families choose to outline the ground rules for any device (including a phone) in a family technology agreement. And it’s not a bad idea: you develop the rules and the boundaries and then have them sign it – just like a contract. I love this agreement from America’s Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) which you can find </span><a href="https://www.fosi.org/good-digital-parenting-tool/family-online-safety-agreement-ages-13-and-under" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, starting high school seems to be a logical time to start thinking about phone ownership, if you haven’t gone down that road before.

As one of the most popular social media platforms of the moment, it is not only being used by our tweens, teens and even grownups to connect but also as a crucial way to tell important stories amidst a backdrop of natural disasters and even war. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As parents, we know we need to keep up with the latest social media platforms but let’s be real – we don’t always have enough time. So, I’m going to do the hard work for you. Here’s my overview of TikTok – what it is, the risks, and most importantly, how you can help your kids (or yourself) stay safe while using it. You’re welcome!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Actually Is Tik Tok?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Tik Tok is a social media platform that can be downloaded on any smartphone via an app. Once you’ve signed up to the app and become a user, you can create and then share short videos of 15 seconds in length on any topic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The app started life as Musical.ly, a super popular video streaming app that also allowed users to make funny 15-second videos, many of which focussed on </span><a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Lip_Sync" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">lip-syncing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. By mid-2017, the app had </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical.ly#:~:text=The%20app%20also%20allowed%20users,reached%20over%20200%20million%20users." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">over 200 million registered users</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.  In 2018, the app was taken over by Chinese company ByteDance and all of its users (and their content) were moved to TikTok.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Popular is Tik Tok?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to Hootsuite, TikTok is the </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">6</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none"> most used social media platform in the world</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. As of late September 2021, TikTok had over a billion monthly users and as of August last year, </span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TikTok-overtakes-Facebook-as-world-s-most-downloaded-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">it overtook Facebook to become the world’s most downloaded app</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Facebook does, however, have more monthly users, reporting a massive </span><a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">2.74 billion users as of August 2021</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Who Is Using It?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It appears TikTok is used by females (57%) more than males (43%) however its user base is very diverse and cuts across all age categories – yes, even us parents! But brands hoping to reach younger female audiences are without a doubt using TikTok to showcase their wares. What is interesting is that although we all think that TikTok dominates the Gen Z market, research shows that it doesn’t rank as the top choice for younger users – in fact only 4.3% of users name it as their favorite platform. Users between 16 and 24 nominate Instagram as their top choice!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Old Do You Need To Be To Use TikTok?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unlike other social media platforms, there is no minimum age requirement when using TikTok. The company says that it adjusts a user’s privacy settings based on the birthday entered when setting up the account. If a user is under the age of 13, they will automatically be directed into the TikTok for Younger Users program which has additional privacy and safety protections. Of course, anyone can lie about their age, but TikTok has said publicly that it has moderators trained to predict when a user is suspected of being underage.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Are The Risks of Tiktok?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you would know, there are risks associated with using all social media platforms and TikTok is no exception. However, in my opinion the majority of these can be managed with a combination of critical thinking, parental controls, and preparation – more about these later. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But let’s go worst-case scenario for one moment. Here are the potential risks that your child could encounter:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How To Manage The Risks On Tiktok?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to keep our tweens and teens in a bubble – I know, so disappointing! So, the best and only option is to prepare them for challenges online and arm them with tools to navigate the tricky stuff. Here’s my advice on how to best help them manage TikTok: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Download The App &amp; Start a Conversation</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Knowledge is power, my friends. So, download the app and have a play so you better understand it. Then, why not ask your experienced in-house ‘TikTokers’ to show you how it works. Use this as an opportunity to ask them what they do when they see something that concerns them, or how they would manage approaches from people they don’t know. Why not weave in reminders about the importance of online privacy and the permanence of their digital footprint? Commit to making these conversations regular. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Foster A Critical Thinking Mindset</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Helping your kids become critical thinkers is, without doubt, one of the best ways of helping them prepare for life’s challenges – both online and offline. Being able to rigorously question ideas and assumptions rather than accepting them at face value is your kids’ golden ticket! So, if they are approached by friendly (but ill-intentioned) strangers online or sent a link to a super compelling offer online, they will have the ‘smarts’ to realise that all is not as it seems and to hit delete!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Use TikTok’s Parental Controls Or Help Them Set Up Privacy &amp; Safety Settings </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If the horse has already bolted and your tween or teen has been using TikTok for a while, then introducing boundaries might be tricky but don’t give up! TikTok has a </span><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-introduces-family-pairing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Family Pairing feature</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> which allows parents to link their TikTok account to their teen’s account so they can control the settings remotely. This might be a good option if your child is younger or just starting out on TikTok. This gives parents the power to turn on Restricted Mode, screen time limits, and also turn off the direct message option. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Leverage Tiktok’s Privacy Controls</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your child has been using TikTok for some time and you want to pull things back, then why not work with them to set up their privacy and safety features. I find kids always respond best when you explain why you are doing something so assure them you are just wanting to keep them safe. TikTok has a long list of features you can enable that will make your offspring’s experience that much safer. From turning off downloads, filtering comments to introducing screen time limits, there is a great range of ways of making the TikTok experience much less risky. Check out the full list from TikTok </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/safety-privacy-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, next time you hear your kids reference TikTok, don’t immediately feel a pang of guilt that you don’t really know what they are talking about. You’ve got this! Download the </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">app</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, take a look around, read this post a few more times, and you’ll be fine! And remember, our kids don’t expect us to be experts straight away, or even at all. They just need to know that we’re interested in all parts of their life and respect just how important their digital life is to them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now here’s a great topic. Spending more quality time with our folks, even if they’re far away. That’s the beauty of a family video chat. It’s a way to connect with more than voice. It’s a way to share moments together.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your parents and the older loved ones in your family haven’t come around to the idea of video chats just yet, now’s a good time to give it a try. Video chats are far easier to enjoy than ever, and with a little initiative from you, the family can gather around a video chat rather quickly. In fact, there’s plenty you can do to get them started. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Video chats may be old hat to you, but it’s likely quite new to them</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Clearly, a video chat is different than a phone call. Beyond the technological differences, it’s quite a different way of interacting. After all, there you are, face-to-face, talking over a device. And that may feel a little awkward, especially for our parents. They’ve lived lives where long-distance conversations meant using a phone that was anchored to the kitchen wall.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So aside from the technical considerations of video chats, there’s a degree of freedom that may leave our parents wondering what to do and how to act in this new medium. Just like when we first used video chat ourselves, questions come up … </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Where should I be looking on the screen </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">… </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">How should I hold the phone </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">… </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Can everyone on this call see up my nose</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can ease them in by taking the lead, welcoming them into the notion that your video chat can be much more than a phone call. More than simply talking, it’s a chance to create a shared space together. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A great example is this: a co-worker recently told me about his in-laws who were scouting out retirement communities to live in. Even though his in-laws lived 2,000 miles away, they all got to do a little house-hunting together. Using a smartphone, they took room-to-room tours of model homes together, got views of the tree-lined streets, checked out the pools and rec centers, and so on. A few weeks later, they shared another video call where his in-laws walked the family through their new place after they’d settled in. And all of it started with a simple request, “Hey, turn on FaceTime so we can take a look too!”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, in a way, video chats truly are an opportunity to create moments together. It could be as simple as asking grandma to read a book to the kids, have mom and dad share what they’re having for a birthday dinner, or ask them to show how hard it’s snowing outside their home. Anything you can do to encourage a little free interaction of some sort may make a video chat feel far more comfortable. You can really relax and interact once you settle in and let the possibilities unfold.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Set a time for your call</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In a way, a video call is much like dropping by the house for a visit. Placing a video call unannounced may catch mom in her curlers, so to speak. Or, as we’ve heard our parents say when they looked at a messy living room, we may catch them when “the house isn’t ready for guests.” In either case, scheduling a time for a video call gives everyone time to prepare. Whether it’s sprucing up your appearance or simply getting into the headspace for a face-to-face interaction, a designated time helps everyone get ready.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On your end, it’s an opportunity for you to prepare as well. Do the kids have some recent schoolwork or a project they’re proud of? Have them bring it for some show-and-tell. Doing some cooking lately and you just can’t seem to get the family secret BBQ sauce just right? Bring your folks into the kitchen for some cooking advice. Find an old treasure in storage? Break it out and flip through your old grade-school art scrapbook with them on the call. As you prepare, think about sharing and moments, some of the things you’d like to do together over a video call. That’ll make it all the more special.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Picking a platform for your video call—smartphones and tablets are a straightforward way to go</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you know, there are plenty ways to hold a video call. There’s a good chance you’ve used several platforms and apps yourself already, whether with friends, work, or a mix of both. So when it comes to picking what’s best for your video call, the question to ask here is what’s your parent’s comfort level with technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your parents are pretty comfortable with technology</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/zooming-with-the-grandkids-five-easy-video-chat-apps-for-the-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">, you can share one of my earlier articles on video calls with them, which walks through the ins and outs of different apps and options</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If they’re a little less savvy with technology, ideally they have a smartphone or tablet that they can use. Chances are, that device will have video calling built right in, such as Apple’s FaceTime or Google Duo on Android devices—both of which make video calls an easier “point and shoot” experience. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even if you’re using different devices, </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212619" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can still use apps like FaceTime between Androids and iPhones</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It’s rather straightforward, as all it takes is for one party or other to click a link. Additionally, Google Duo is available as an app in Apple’s App Store, which makes it easy for everyone to get on one platform as needed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If a smartphone or tablet isn’t in the picture, there are certainly options for laptops and computers, several you may also know well already. Of the free and relatively straightforward apps out there, you can choose from:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Once you’re all set up, here are a few things that you and your parents can do to help keep your calls private and secure.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Set a password</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If your video chap app generates a link that others can click to join in, be sure to create a password that uninvited parties can’t join in as well. Also, don’t be shy about asking your family members to use a password on the calls they initiate. It’s pretty much standard practice nowadays.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Double-check any video chat invitation links</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Likewise, with any chat link that’s sent to you, be sure that link is legitimate. Confirm the link with the family member who sent it, particularly if you weren’t expecting one. (This is another good reason to schedule calls. Family members will be on the lookout for that link.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) Use security software</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Make sure that you’re using </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that helps steer you clear of scam emails and links, along with browser protection that blocks links that could send you to sketchy websites.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Aside from giving you the latest features and functionality, updates also often include essential security improvements. Set your computer to update itself automatically and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">consider using security software that will scan for vulnerabilities and install updates automatically</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> as needed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">An interesting closing note is that getting comfortable with video chat may open a world of other possibilities as well. Perhaps once they get online and see how video chats work, they’ll reach out to other friends and them get in on it too, creating more opportunities to reach out and spend time with others. In other words, you may really start something here by getting mom and dad on video chat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, early research has shown that </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/health/elderly-zoom-dementia-pandemic-scli-scn-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">older adults who use regularly technologies like video chat have seen positive impacts in their long-term memory</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> compared to those who just interacted over the phone or in person. Similarly, research has shown that </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25062353/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the use of technology, in general, can enhance mental health for older adults</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that, I hope you’ll give it a try with your parents and older loved ones. Meet the inevitable technical bumps in the road with a smile because this journey will be absolutely worth it. For all of you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

Dutifully taking you the places you want to go online, whether that’s the bank, the store, the movies, or even to work. All the more reason to make sure your browser gets every last bit of protection it can.</p>
<p>It’s easy to fire up your browser without a second thought. Arguably, it’s one of the first things many of us do when we hop on our computers. And because it’s often our literal window into important tasks like managing our finances, making payments, and so forth, hackers will absolutely target browsers in order to conduct their attacks. Whether it’s through vulnerabilities in the code that runs the browser, injecting malicious code into a browser session or <a href="https://www.itbusinessedge.com/security/top-five-vulnerabilities-attackers-use-against-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any one of several other attack vectors</a>, hackers will try to find a way to compromise computers via the browser.</p>
<p>What’s one of the best ways to keep your browser safe? In a word, update. By updating your browser, you’ll get the latest in features and functionality in addition to security fixes that can keep you safer out there.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what a safer browser is all about, how to update yours, and check out some additional things you can do to stay safer still.</p>
<h2><strong>Browser hacks go way back—and are here to stay</strong></h2>
<p>Just as long as there have been browsers, there have been security vulnerabilities and issues. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/ddj-netscape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Among the first documented cases, one of the most noteworthy goes back to 1995</a> when researchers at the University of California, Berkeley uncovered a security issue with the way the Netscape browser handled online payments. Today, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2022/02/15/google-chrome-warning-zero-day-hack-security-exploit-new-chrome-update/?sh=7884596e73c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news of potential browser exploits and follow-on security measures to remedy them still make the headlines</a> all <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-rolls-out-important-security-fix-stable-version-edge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across several types</a> of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/safari-flaws-webcam-online-accounts-mic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular browsers</a>.</p>
<p>The reality of the issue is that browsers, humble as they may seem to us, are complex applications made up of myriad smaller applications to handle all manner of tasks that create your overall web browsing experience. And where there’s code, there’s room for error. Errors that hackers will look to exploit until an update comes along and fixes them.</p>
<h2><strong>Browser plug-ins and extensions add extra features—and potential risks</strong></h2>
<p>Adding further functionality to your browser, and potentially further opportunities for hackers, are browser plug-ins and extensions. These are small apps that give your browser additional capabilities, like opening and editing documents, blocking ads, finding coupons, and even playing tabletop role-playing games in a browser as well. In short, there are thousands of them, often available in the various stores run by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different</a> <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1377753262">developers</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, browser plug-ins and extensions can be prone to security issues just like the browser they’re installed in. Errors in their code may lead to exploits that hackers can take advantage of. Further, not all plug-ins and extensions are safe and secure to use. It’s not uncommon for malicious ones to turn up on third-party sites that steal user information, introduce malware, or that end up serving ads on a person’s computer, just to name a few of the nasty things they can do. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-removes-500-malicious-chrome-extensions-from-the-web-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even official browser stores have had malicious plug-ins and extensions slip onto their shelves</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/18/i-found-your-data-its-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even seemingly legitimate plug-ins and extensions can introduce privacy issues</a>. Given that they’re on your browser and have been granted permissions to work with it, they could be collecting data—data which the developer may use, share, or resell. And it may be tough to know exactly what’s being collected and what’s being done with it. Yet like many smartphone app stores, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/starting-next-year-chrome-extensions-will-show-what-data-they-collect-from-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser stores are including links to developer privacy statements on the download page for the plug-ins and extensions they offer</a>, giving people more insight into how their data is used. However, sometimes plug-ins and extensions get sold from one company to another where they not only change owners but privacy policies as well. In other words, that plug-in or extension on your computer may get sold to another company without your knowledge and subsequently decide to use your data in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>Given this landscape, there’s a clear case for updating your browser regularly, along with your plug-ins and extensions as well. Moreover, you might want to take a look at what plug-ins and extensions you’re running as well to ensure they’re secure and that they’re something you actually have use for.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how you can do all that.</p>
<h2><strong>So, do you keep your browser and extensions up to date?</strong></h2>
<p>Set up your browser to update automatically. This is relatively straightforward, and browser developers have pages that show you how it’s done. For example, sampling a few of the browsers out there:</p>
<ul>

<p>As for updating your extensions, the browser developers have put together quick guides to help you what that too. The good news is that when you update your browser, your browser typically updates its associated plug-ins and extensions as well. However, note that your browser’s update cycle may not be in sync with the update cycle for your various plug-ins and extensions, so you may want to go in and update them on their own. These guides can help:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.cloudhq.net/how-to-manually-update-chrome-extensions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Updating Extensions on Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1319369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Updating Extensions on Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/enterprise/auto-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Updating Extensions on Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Updating Extensions on Safari</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&lt;h2&gt;Take a look at your browser extensions—and see if you want them in the first place</strong></p>
<p>What extensions am I even running? Now that’s a great question. And it’s not too tough to get the answer. In short, your browser’s menu will have an option that will give you an overview of what you have installed and which ones are enabled for use. Once more, each browser developer has their own way of going about this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View and Manage Your Extensions on Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-add-features-to-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View and Manage Your Extensions on Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/find-add-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-f3522273-d067-7435-6a9d-fdb99213e9a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View and Manage Your Extensions on Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/get-extensions-sfri32508/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View and Manage Your Extensions on Safari</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good opportunity to give your extensions a hard look. Are they something you use? Are they something you want? Who developed that extension? What might they be doing with my data? Answering these questions may take a little work on your part—like searching for news, information, or reviews about the various extensions you have installed. If you don’t like what your research turns up, you can simply uninstall the extension in question.</p>
<p>A good general rule is this—the fewer apps and extensions you have, the fewer you have to update. Likewise, that’s ultimately fewer lines of code that may turn up a possible exploit. If it’s something you’re not using, consider getting rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;h2&gt;Make your browser safer with web protection</strong></p>
<p>Many browser-based attacks find their way to you through sketchy websites and downloads. Even ads that look legit but are not. As said before, hackers will try and find a way. One tool you can use to beat them at their game is browser protection, which helps prevent you from making that one wrong click that leads to malware.</p>
<p>In our case, we offer <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee WebAdvisor, a lightweight app that helps keep you safe from threats while you browse and search the web</a>. Specifically, it includes three types of protection that can help steer you clear of those sketchy websites and downloads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146047" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/browser-image.png" alt="" width="624" height="141" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/browser-image.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/browser-image-300x68.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/browser-image-205x46.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>It’s a free download, and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s also included with our comprehensive online protection software</a>. Either way, this provides you with yet another line of defense when it comes to browser-based attacks.</p>
<h2><strong>Protect your browser from hacks and attacks. Update.</strong></h2>
<p>That’s the big reason to update right there. Updates give you one more way to prevent attacks by fixing known security issues. It’s true for your operating systems, your apps, your games, what have you. All of them rely on sometimes complex code, code which can sprout exploits, ones that hackers will use. Count your browser in that mix as well. Updating your browser, plus its plug-ins and extensions will help keep you safer online.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, individual states can determine their own laws for sports betting.

<p><span data-contrast="none">If you’re a sports fan, this news has probably been hard to miss. Or at least the outcome of it all has been hard to miss. Commercials and signage in and around games promote several major online betting platforms. Ads have naturally made their way online too, complete with all kinds of promo offers to encourage people to get in on the action. However, that’s also opened the door for scammers who’re looking to take advantage of people looking to make a bet online, according to the </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/26620-bbb-scam-alert-betting-on-a-big-game-dont-fall-for-a-sports-betting-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.

<p><span data-contrast="none">However, the BBB stresses that people should be aware that the terms and conditions associated with online sports betting will vary from service to service, as will the promotions that they offer. The BBB accordingly advises people to closely read these terms, conditions and offers.

Also, the BBB cautions people about those promo offers that are often heavily advertised, “[L]ike any sales pitch, these can be deceptive. Be sure to read the fine print carefully.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Where do scammers enter the mix? The BBB points to the rise of consumer complaints around bogus betting sites:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Scammers will make up various excuses. For example, they may claim technical issues or insist on additional identity verification. In other cases, they may require you to deposit even more money before you can withdraw your winnings. Whatever you do, you’ll never be able to get your money off the site. And any personal information you shared is now in the hands of scam artists.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559685&quot;:864,&quot;335559737&quot;:864,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If there’s a good reason you should stick to the “white labeled” sites that are approved by your state’s gaming commission, this is it. Take a pass on any online ads that promote betting sites, particularly if they roll out big and almost too-good-to-be-true offers. These may lead you to shady or bogus sites. Instead, visit the ones that are approved in your state by typing in their address directly into your browser.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Check the rep of the service.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In addition to choosing a state-approved option, </span><a href="http://www.bbb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">check out the organization’s BBB listing at BBB.org.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> Here you can get a snapshot of customer ratings, complaints registered against the organization, and the organization’s response to the complaints, along with its BBB rating, if it has one. Doing a little reading here can be enlightening, giving you a sense of what issues arise and how the organization has historically addressed them. For example, you may see a common complaint and how it’s commonly resolved. You may also see where the organization has simply chosen not to respond, all of which can shape your decision whether to bet with them or not.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Use a secure payment method other than your debit card.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Credit cards are a good way to go. </span><span data-contrast="auto">One reason why is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-credit-billing-act-fcba.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Fair Credit Billing Act</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which offers protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards by giving you the right to dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly.

And I’m totally fine being alone: chopping, stirring and baking until it’s time to clean up! And that’s when the overwhelm hits – I know I should clean as I cook but I never do! So, what do I do? Rally the troops! Yes siree! There’s nothing like another set of eyes or hands to help one wade through the overwhelm – I’m sure that’s why I had 4 kids!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Online Life Can Be Messy Too!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many people tell me that they feel a similar way about their online life. They know they need to be doing more to keep themselves safe, but they are completely overwhelmed at where to start. With so much of our lives lived online, it’s not uncommon for one person to have over a hundred online accounts across multiple devices which makes it very hard to keep track of logins, data breaches, or security software. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And research conducted by McAfee shows that consumers know they need to take steps to protect themselves with 74% of users concerned about keeping information private online and 57% keen to be in more control of their personal information. Not surprisingly, since the pandemic started 47% of online consumers feel unsafe compared to just 29% beforehand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Where to Start? Your Protection Score!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, to try and make this very overwhelming task that bit easier, McAfee has developed a </span><a href="https://protection.mcafee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">new tool that allows you to find your own Protection Score</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Think of your Protection Score like your credit score or sleep score except this one is a measure of your security online. The higher the score, the safer you are online. And the best part about the score is that helps users identify exactly where they need to pinpoint their focus to ensure they are as safe as possible online. Think of it as a set of experienced hands to help you wade through the overwhelm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Does It Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In less than a minute, the McAfee Protection Score will provide you with a pretty clear understanding of how safe you are online. Participants are given a mark between 0 and 1000 that is based on several factors: whether you have online protection and whether your details have been leaked in a security breach. Now, don’t be alarmed if your score is low because here’s the best bit – you will receive a list of exactly what you need to do to improve it and protect yourself from online threats! Phew – my competitive type A personality wouldn’t have coped if I was unable to fix it! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let me give you an example, when I signed up, I was alerted to the fact that my email address had been involved in a breach, yes – I’m very human! So, it helped me remedy this by taking me to the appropriate page where I could update my password, and then, bingo, my score (and online safety) improved!! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And just to ensure you remain committed, every time you venture back to the </span><a href="https://protection.mcafee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Protection Score</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> page, your results and action plan will be there waiting for you to ensure you stay on track and most importantly, to cut through that overwhelm!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, in case you were wondering, McAfee’s Protection Score is a first for the cybersecurity industry but good news &#8211; they’ve promised it will continue evolving. They will continue to add more features and opportunities to personalize so you can ensure you are living life to the full online!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if you’re feeling overwhelmed at exactly what you need to do to get your online safety under control then </span><a href="https://protection.mcafee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s Protection Score</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is exactly what you need. In less than a minute you’ll be able to get a clear understanding of where your online security sits and a personalized action plan so you can start addressing it right away! How good is that?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Some of the most significant data breaches in internet history weren’t after bank account numbers, cryptocurrency, or even credit card numbers. They were, in fact, after YOU. That’s right, the most valuable data on the internet is the data that comprises your </span>identity. Let’s take a look at what that data is, how it gets leveraged by cybercriminals, and how you can get the online identity monitoring you deserve.</p>
<h2 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Identity exposure in the news </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">1 billion is a big number. In the case of a recent </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/06/16/cvs-accidentally-leaks-1-billion-website-records-including-covid-19-vaccine-searches/?sh=1ca8bd4d2c4f&amp;utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">CVS database leak,</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that’s how many user records were accidentally released online, including details like email addresses and even searches about Covid vaccines. This is just one of the dozens of breaches that have occurred recently and will continue to happen as personally, identifiable information becomes more valuable to cybercriminals. Just as remarkable as the huge volume of user data being exposed online is the speed with which compromised data is used by hackers online. Cybersecurity researchers recently </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-how-fast-a-password-leaked-on-the-web-will-be-tested-out-by-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">discovered</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that cybercriminals access leaked or stolen credentials within 12 hours to exploit them as soon as possible. These circumstances beg the question, why has your personally identifiable information has become so valuable lately? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Why your Personally Identifiable Information is worth so much to criminals online  </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While the value of some information, like a credit card number, is obvious, you may think your name and date of birth aren’t that big of a deal. After all, it wasn’t so long ago that you could find all that information in a phone book. In fact, personally identifiable </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">information</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (PII), also known as data used to identify a specific individual, is what many </span><a href="https://allpointsprotects.com/pii-what-is-it-and-why-its-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data breaches</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> are after.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Armed with just a mailing address, a phone number, and a date of birth, a cybercriminal can begin constructing a fake </span>identity<span data-contrast="none"> to take out loans and disguise many kinds of criminal activities. With a social security number and a few personal details from a social media account, they could take over a bank account. When it comes to your PII, any information is as good as gold to cybercriminals.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Your PII may not be as safe as you think.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If our PII were treated like actual gold and held in a safe location like Fort Knox, I wouldn’t be writing this post. But in fact, it’s the currency we use to obtain many services in our connected lives. Social media sites are massive repositories of PII, and their access to our most personal details and the ability to sell it to marketers is the reason the service remains free. Free email services are the same. Now consider all the other accounts we may have created to, say, try out a streaming service for free, or even old accounts we no longer use. From that perspective, you can see how much of your data is being used by companies, may not be very well protected, and is a tempting target for cybercriminals. Fortunately, there are many things you can do to keep your </span>identity safer online.</p>
<h2 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Learn to spot a breach and to keep your identity safer</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When it comes to protecting your PII, knowledge is power. Let’s start by identifying if you’ve been the target of a data breach. Here are a few tell-tale signs:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Okay, now that you know the signs of a data breach, let’s look at how you can take action to protect yourself. The </span>best way to avoid being the victim of identity theft is by limiting the amount of PII you provide. There are some easy ways to do this.</p>
<h3 aria-level="4"><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Avoid giving out your social security number whenever possible</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Only a few types of organizations legitimately need your social security number. These include employers or when contracting with a business, group health insurance, financial and real estate transactions, applying for credit cards, car loans, and so forth.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Quizzes, social media games, and other kinds of interactive clickbait are often grifting pieces of your PII in a seemingly playful way.

<p>Clearly, we’re in a new era when it comes to securing our identities online. In response, McAfee has created a new kind of identity monitoring.</p>
<p>We knew from the outset Identity monitoring had to be proactive, holistic, and accessible. We also wanted it to follow the timeline for how cybercrime actually affects your identity.  When it comes to PII, the breach is just the first step for cybercriminals. The 10 months following a breach is when cybercriminals will use your PII to commit fraudulent acts using your data.</p>
<p>To address this, your identity monitoring looks after more personally identifiable information than other leading competitors. It will also alert you of stolen personal info an average of 10 months ahead of other monitoring services. And it’s accessible anywhere via mobile app, browser, and the web.</p>
<p>In practice, McAfee’s identity monitoring protects all your online accounts by doing the following:</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you’re already in the cryptocurrency game or are thinking about taking the plunge, here’s what you need to know about crypto wallets and tips on how to keep yours safe from cybercriminals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Is a Crypto Wallet? </span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A cryptocurrency wallet, or crypto wallet, is a software product or a physical device that stores the public and private keys to your cryptocurrency accounts. Keys are strings of numbers and letters that encrypt and decrypt crypto transactions and secure crypto accounts. You can think of public keys as the routing and account numbers that appear at the bottom of paper checks. There’s not much a nefarious character can do with that information, and it’s totally normal to give that information to an acquaintance with whom you’re doing business. Private keys are like your online banking password or debit PIN. Those you must guard very closely because in the wrong hands, your hard-earned bank balance could disappear. A crypto wallet also allows you to transfer funds between crypto types and make transactions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Are Some Types of Crypto Wallets? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here are a few basic types of crypto wallets to help you decide which type is right for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Noncustodial vs. custodial</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A non-custodial wallet means that you are the sole keeper of the keys to your crypto assets. If you forget your password, there’s no “forgot your password?” prompt to let you back in. While not having this safety net is a little nerve wracking, noncustodial wallets are considered the more secure option. You don’t have to worry about a security breach of a major corporation leaking your private key. If you’re responsible and confident that you’re prepared to look after your assets by yourself, this may be the best option for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A custodial wallet is a little less secure, but you have a third party helping you log in and manage your crypto accounts. Custodial wallets are often web-based, and the biggest tick in their pro column is that they’re generally very easy to use. While reputable custodial wallets take security very seriously, the threat of a breach is always a possibility, especially as crypto accounts are appealing targets to cybercriminals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Hardware vs. software</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are devices you can fit in the palm of your hand. Most models are Bluetooth-enabled devices that look like small remote controls or are flash drives. The device is secured by a PIN that you should never write down or share with anyone else. Also, you should designate a safe and private spot to store your hardware wallet. Similar to a noncustodial wallet, you are solely responsible for keeping track of the device and remembering the PIN. If you lose it, your crypto accounts are locked, and there’s no locksmith to open them for you. As long as you keep track of it, hardware wallets are very secure. Most models are equipped with malware- and virus-proofing security features.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Software wallets are downloaded and internet-connected mobile or desktop apps. They allow you to make transactions on the run, as you can access your crypto accounts from your phone. In that sense, they’re more convenient than hardware wallets. Additionally, software wallets have the same safety net as custodial wallets: if you lose your phone, forget your password, or require login assistance, the maker of the software can help you access your accounts. Software wallets are very secure when you enable their two-factor authentication login settings; however, since they connect to the internet, there’s always a chance a cybercriminal could break-in. Thus, hardware wallets are considered more secure than the software variety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Keep Your Crypto Wallet Safe</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Check out these tips to ensure your assets are safe and secure in your crypto wallet:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Check your accounts regularly. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">It’s imperative that you check your crypto wallet regularly to ensure that your accounts look in order and you can catch suspicious activity quickly. Crypto wallets and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/how-to-secure-your-digital-wallet/"><span data-contrast="none">digital wallets</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are unlike the physical one you carry in your pocket or your bag, because when your physical wallet goes missing, you’re likely to notice it quickly. “Phone, keys, wallet” is a mantra most of us sing before walking out the door. Plus, everyone knows the immediate steps to take when a physical wallet goes missing: retrace your steps, put a hold on credit and debit cards, file for a new driver’s license. If you think something is amiss with your wallet, cancel any credit cards linked to your account, change your password immediately and set up two-factor authentication if you haven’t already.</span></li>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Set up two-factor authentication.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Speaking of login security, always make sure you enable two-factor authentication. It is one of the best ways to deter a thief. If your device has biometric authentication, that’s even better. This means that only a scan of your face, voice, or fingerprint will open your accounts. </span></li>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Know how to identify crypto wallet scams.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Watch out for phishers who may be persistent in trying to gain access to your cryptocurrency accounts. If anyone by email, text, phone, or snail mail asks for your private key, ignore the correspondence and go on high alert. Never share your private key with anyone! Phishing attempts often use fear or excitement to trick people into divulging personal information, so don’t fall for messages masquerading as contests or as a crypto company that needs your private key to restore your accounts. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Explore Crypto Safely and Confidently</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency value is reaching galactic heights like the spaceships depicted in prime-time ads. Don’t feel pressured to hop aboard the crypto rocket, but if you do decide to jump on, make sure you do your research carefully and make the best decisions for your crypto goals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s no doubt that more older adults than ever are taking advantage of online doctor visits, more formally known as telemedicine. While usage numbers have risen dramatically across all age groups, it’s particularly so for elders. Pre- and post-pandemic numbers saw </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/12/03/new-hhs-study-shows-63-fold-increase-in-medicare-telehealth-utilization-during-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a 63-fold increase in Medicare telemedicine use</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, many older patients are missing out and not using telemedicine for one reason or another.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">What’s holding them back? Several things, according to</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2768772" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> research from the University of California, San Francisco</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Unreadiness with regards to technology, such as not having access to a telemedicine-ready device or knowing how to use it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">A lack of familiarity with the internet, particularly if they have not used email, texting, or the internet in general within the past month.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">No access or limited access to a broadband connection (particularly in rural areas).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, another issue is that many older adults do not know that telemedicine is an option. </span><a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/virtual-visits-telehealth-and-older-adults" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Research from the University of Michigan</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> showed that 55% of older adults surveyed were unaware if their healthcare provider even offered telemedicine as a service. And perhaps quite telling is that the same survey revealed nearly half of older adults harbored concerns about privacy and did not feel personally connected to their care provider during their visits.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For us as children and grandchildren of older adults, it can be tough knowing that a loved one is missing out on an avenue of care that they could otherwise benefit from. While we absolutely respect what they feel is comfortable and trustworthy for them, there are several other areas where we can help the older loved ones in our lives overcome the issues and concerns they face. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, let’s talk about the technology behind telemedicine and how you can help them use it, and address some of those privacy issues as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Easing into telemedicine</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As indicated above, paying a visit to the doctor via telemedicine can be a big jump. Just as the idea of it is new for many of us, it’s yet newer for older adults. There’s a good chance that you’re familiar with video chats and calls already, which gives you a foundation we can work with when it’s time to see the doctor on a screen. That may not be the case for older adults. Add that into the privacy concerns and decades of seeing a doctor in person, you can see why some older adults simply choose to opt-out.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way you can help is to have a few video chats with your older loved ones. In addition to the regular calls you make, you might want to try having a video chat with them from time to time. It’s an outstanding way to spend time together when you can’t be together in person, and it may develop a comfort level with the technology so that they may be willing to give telemedicine a try. You can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/helping-mom-dad-family-video-chats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">check out my earlier article in this series</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that covers video chats with mom and dad, along with straightforward steps to get them up and running on the technology and how to use it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Get them set up on the right device for telemedicine</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One thing your parents will need for their visit is a reliable device that they’re comfortable using. It could be a computer or laptop, or it may be a smartphone or tablet. Note that in some cases their healthcare provider may use a telemedicine solution that has certain requirements as well, so you’ll want to see what those are and ensure that the device mom or dad has is compatible. (For example, the care provider may have an app that’s available through the Apple App Store or Google Play. Others may have an online platform that can be accessed by several different kinds of devices.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If they’re using a smartphone or tablet, that will likely make things easier because the camera and microphone are already integrated into the device—all set up and ready to go. For a computer or laptop, you can help them get familiar with the setup, like the microphone levels, speaker volume, and camera. For audio, you can see a set of headphones or smartphone earbuds work well for them, which can help prevent audio feedback loops and simply make it easier to hear the caregiver. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If they don’t already have </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software for their devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, look into getting it. This will protect them against malware, viruses, and phishing attacks. They’ll also benefit from other features that help them manage their passwords, protect their identity, safeguard their privacy, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As for privacy in general, medical information is among the most precious information any of us have. For example, here in the U.S., we have </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/index.html"><span data-contrast="none">HIPPA</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> privacy standards to protect our medical records and conversations. Yet there’s also the issue of eavesdropping, which is a risk in practically any online communication. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To help address privacy issues and concerns, health care providers will often post a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) as part of their telemedicine service. Within that, you’ll very likely find a section on personal privacy and the technologies in place to protect it. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/services/virtual-clinic/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a good example of a telemedicine FAQ</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from the University of Washington Medicine and another example from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamason.org/telehealth-for-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the telemedicine page that Virginia Mason/Franciscan Health designed for its patients</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, if your parents have concerns about their privacy, you can absolutely assure them that it’s a valid concern. Consult the provider’s FAQ for guidance. If either of you has further questions, feel free to call the healthcare provider and speak with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Help them pick a private place and get prepared for the call</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to digital security, there’s the possibility of physical eavesdropping, somebody actually listening in on their conversation from another room, apartment, or from the street. Help your older loved ones pick a place in their home where they can have some privacy and where they can’t be overheard by neighbors and passers-by. A bedroom is a fine place—or any location that’s familiar and comfortable as well. When choosing a private place, a well-lit location is important as well so that the camera captures a nice and clear image.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, you can help them prep for their visit by putting together a list of things to discuss during the visit. </span><a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/patients/preparing-for-a-video-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests writing things down</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to the above, there are further measures you can help your parents or older loved one take to further secure their telemedicine visit—and their internet usage in general.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Use strong, unique passwords</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your telemedicine visit may require setting up a new account and password. When doing so, make sure it’s with a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">strong, unique password</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. A password manager can help. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Also found in comprehensive online protection software, a password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can create and securely store strong and unique passwords for your mom and dad, giving them one less thing they need to remember and worry about.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Use a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A VPN, or virtual private network, offers a strong layer of additional protection when you’re transmitting health data or simply having a private conversation about your health with a professional. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel to keep you and your activity anonymous. In effect, your data is scrambled and hidden to anyone outside your VPN tunnel, thus making your private information difficult to collect. Check with the care provider to see if their telemedicine solution uses a VPN. If not, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html"><span data-contrast="none">you can always get a VPN as part of your online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Secure their internet router</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond their devices, securing their internet router is an important step in making a telemedicine visit safe and secure. The data that travels along it is of a highly personal nature already, so </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">make sure the router has a strong and unique password</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Also, change the name of their router so it doesn’t give away their address or any other signs of their identity. One more step is to check that your router is using an encryption method, like WPA2, which will keep your signal secure. If you have questions, check with their internet provider—they may even offer up a newer, more secure router to replace an older one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">The best telemedicine choice is the one that’s right for your parents</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with anything concerning their health, have your parents and loved ones consult with their caregivers to ensure that a telemedicine visit is a proper course for them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while the technical ins and outs of preparing for a telemedicine visit may have their challenges for some older adults, we should also realize that getting comfortable with the idea of a telemedicine visit in the first place may take some time and effort. Starting with regular video chats with the family may increase familiarity and ease with holding a conversation over video. Likewise, having a conversation with their doctor about telemedicine may put some concerns to rest as well. After all, they will have a relationship with their doctor.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers won’t limit themselves to posing as the IRS. They’ll act as an imposter in several other ways as well. For example, they may pose as a popular do-it-yourself tax brand, a tax preparer, or even as a phony charitable organization that promises any donations you make are tax-deductible. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here, they may send you phony emails or direct messages or even ring you up with bogus telemarketing or robocalls designed to steal personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the cases where the scammers reach you online, the emails and messages they send will vary in their tone and polish—in other words, how authentic they appear. Some will look nearly legitimate and cause even the most hardened of digital skeptics to click on a phony link or download a sketchy attachment. Others, well, will look clearly like spam, complete with spelling and grammatical errors, along with clumsy use of logos, layouts, and design. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, both are ways that scammers get people to visit sites designed to compromise personal information … or to download malware like keyloggers that skim account passwords and ransomware that encrypt a victim’s files hold them hostage for a price. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media attacks also made the IRS Dirty Dozen. In a social media attack, scammers harvest information from social media profiles and turn it against their victims. Per the IRS, because “social media enables anyone to share information with anyone else on the Internet, scammers use that information as ammunition for a wide variety of scams. These include emails where scammers impersonate someone&#8217;s family, friends, or co-workers.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With those personal details gleaned from social media, scammers will send phony links to scam sites, promote bogus charities, or flat-out ask for money or gift cards to “help them out” at tax time. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself from tax season scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep your guard up for spammy messages and phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No question that bogus emails, messages, and phone calls remain a popular way for scammers to steal personal and financial information. Spam emails, messages, and the malicious links associated with them abound this time of year as well. It’s always to keep a critical eye open for these, and it’s particularly true during tax season. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">View all emails with attachments and links with suspicion, even if they appear to come from a person, business, or brand you know. Confirm attachments with the people you know before opening. And if you receive a message or alert about an account of yours, visit that company or organization’s website directly to enquire into the status of your account rather than taking a chance by clicking on a link that could send you to a phony website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to protect yourself from an identity thief from claiming a return in your name is to file yours before they do. In fact, many victims of identity theft find out they’ve been scammed when they receive an IRS notification that their tax claim has already been filed. Simply put, file early.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s another tool that can help you fight identity theft. And get this: it’s not only helpful, but it’s also </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">free</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> Through the Federal Trade Commission, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> from each of the three major credit reporting companies once every 12 months.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In this report, you can find inaccuracies in your credit or evidence of all-out identity theft. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Keep in mind that you get one report from each of the reporting companies each year. That works out to three reports total in one year. Consider this: if you request one report from one credit reporting company every four months, you can spread your free credit report coverage across the whole year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep your social media profiles and posts close to the vest</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with much of the guidance we offer around social media, one of the best ways to prevent such social media tax attacks is to make your profiles private so that only friends and family can see them. That way, scammers will have a far more difficult time reaching you. Moreover, consider paring back the information you share in your social media profiles, like your alma maters, birthday, mother’s maiden name, pet names—any personal information that a scammer may use to compromise your accounts or the security questions associated with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Over the past year, you may have seen the term </span><b><span data-contrast="none">ransomware</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> popping up frequently. There’s good reason for that as ransomware is responsible for 21% of all cyberattacks, according to a </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">new report</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. For enterprising hackers, this tactic has become standard operating procedure because it’s effective and organizations are willing to pay. But what does that mean for you and living a confident life online? Fortunately, there are a number of things individuals can do to avoid ransomware. But first, let’s start with the basics. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Ransomware</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim’s information at ransom. The hacker uses it to encrypt a user or organization’s critical data so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications. A ransom is then demanded to provide access. It is a growing threat, generating </span><a href="https://pdf.ic3.gov/2018_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">billions of dollars</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> in payments to cybercriminals and inflicting significant damage and expenses for businesses and governmental organizations.  </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The top ransomware infection vectors – a fancy term for the way you get ransomware on your device – are phishing and vulnerability exploits. Of these two, phishing is responsible for a full </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">41% of ransomware infections</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Ironically, this is good news, because phishing is something we can learn to spot and avoid by educating ourselves about how scammers work. Before we get into specific tips, know that phishing can take the form of many types of communications including emails, texts, and voicemails. Also know that scammers are convincingly imitating some of the biggest brands in the world to get you to surrender your credentials or install malware on your device. With that in mind, here are several tips to avoid getting phished.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Be cautious of emails asking you to act </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you receive an email, call, or text asking you to download software or pay a certain amount of money, don’t click on anything or take any direct action from the message. Instead, go straight to the organization’s website. This will prevent you from downloading malicious content from </span><b><span data-contrast="none">phishing</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> links or forking over money unnecessarily.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Hover over links to see and verify the URL</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If someone sends you a message with a link, hover over the link without clicking on it. This will allow you to see a link preview. If the URL looks suspicious, don’t interact with it and delete the message altogether.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Instead of clicking on a link in an email or text message, it’s always best to check directly with the source to verify an offer, request, or link.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="none">Put ransomware fears in your rearview mirror with these tips:</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you do get ransomware, the story isn’t over. Below are 8 remediation tips that can help get your data back, along with your peace of mind.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Back up your data </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p>If you get ransomware, you’ll want to immediately disconnect any infected devices from your networks to prevent the spread of it. This means you’ll be locked out of your files by ransomware and be unable to move the infected files. Therefore, it’s crucial that you always have backup copies of them, preferably in the cloud and on an external hard drive. This way, if you do get a ransomware infection, you can wipe your computer or device free and reinstall your files from backup.  Backups protect your data, and you won’t be tempted to reward the malware authors by paying a ransom. Backups won’t prevent ransomware, but they can mitigate the risks.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Change your credentials</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p>If you discover that a data leak or a ransomware attack has compromised a company you’ve interacted with, act immediately and change your passwords for all your accounts. And while you’re at it, go the extra mile and create passwords that are seriously hard to crack with this next tip.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Take password protection seriously</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When updating your credentials, you should always ensure that your password is strong and unique. Many users utilize the same password or variations of it across all their accounts. Therefore, be sure to diversify your passcodes to ensure hackers cannot obtain access to all your accounts at once, should one password be compromised. You can also employ a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> to keep track of your credentials and generate secure login keys.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Two or multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security, as it requires multiple forms of verification. For instance, you’ll be asked to verify your identity through another device, such as a phone. This reduces the risk of successful impersonation by hackers.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5. Browse safely online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p>Be careful where you click. Don’t respond to emails and text messages from people you don’t know, and only download applications from trusted sources. This is important since malware authors often use social engineering to get you to install dangerous files. Using a security extension on your web browser is one way to browse more safely.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">6. Only use secure networks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, since many of them are not secure, and cybercriminals can snoop on your internet usage. Instead, consider installing a VPN, which provides you with a secure connection to the internet no matter where you go.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7. Never pay the ransom</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p>While it is often large organizations that fall prey to ransomware attacks, you can also be targeted by a ransomware campaign. If this happens, don’t pay the ransom. Although you may feel that this is the only way to get your encrypted files back, there is no guarantee that the ransomware developers will send a decryption tool once they receive the payment. Paying the ransom also contributes to the development of more ransomware families, so it’s best to hold off on making any payments. Thankfully there are free resources devoted to helping you like McAfee’s No More Ransomware initiative McAfee, along with other organizations, created www.nomoreransom.org/ to educate the public about ransomware and, more importantly, to provide decryption tools to help people recover files that have been locked by ransomware. On the site you’ll find decryption tools for many types of ransomware, including the Shade ransomware.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7. Use a comprehensive security solution</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Adding an extra layer of security with a solution such as </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee® Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, which includes Ransom Guard, can help protect your devices from these cyber threats. In addition, make sure you update your devices’ software (including security software!) early and often, as patches for flaws are typically included in each update. Comprehensive security solutions also include many of the tools we mentioned above and are simply the easiest way to ensure digital wellness online. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

Together, we can make a difference in creating a more equitable world for all.</p>
<p>At McAfee, we know that genuine change requires continuous commitment. And while we’re proud of the efforts we’re making as a company – from being the first cybersecurity company to achieve global pay parity (and maintain it), to expanded time off for new parents, to a woman on every hiring panel to help remove bias – we know there is more to do.</p>
<p>This International Women’s Day and beyond, McAfee team members around the globe share how they’ll continue to advance inclusion and gender equality by actively working to #BreakTheBias.</p>

The combination of homeschooling, working from home, and not going anywhere has completely drained many Aussie working parents, me included!! Many of us have been in survival mode – just focusing on the basics to get through!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Well, now we’re getting back to some sort of normal and we have a little more time to breathe, it’s time to focus on those overdue jobs and that includes doing an audit of your family’s online safety. Now, I know it might seem boring, but I promise you it’s worth the effort. So, I thought I’d share with you a checklist of what you need to do to ensure your family is as safe as possible when online. Let’s get started:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Passwords</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your first task is to ensure every family member has a different password for each of their online accounts. Yes, I know – that sounds completely overwhelming. But hear me out. If you have the same password for all your online accounts and you get hacked, then you could be in a world of pain – as the hacker now has access to all your online accounts!! So, this is very much worth sorting out. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, there are many ways of managing a long list of passwords. You could write them down in a special, secret book. You could call on your </span><a href="https://www.mensa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Mensa</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> level memory and try to remember 50 plus passwords – unfortunately, that’s not me! So, let me give you the best solution – a password manager. Password Managers can both generate and remember super complex passwords that no human could even concoct. Check out </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> – it’s free and a complete no-brainer, my friends!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Software Updates</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before my life as Cybermum, I used to think software updates were a massive inconvenience. Something else to add to the never-ending list. But how wrong was I! A software update addresses security flaws or bugs in the current version of the app or program. Their goal is to protect the user. So, if you’re serious about protecting your family, these updates can’t be ignored. The easiest way to manage this is to set updates to be automatic, where possible. You can also do this with apps on your phone – for both Apple and Android devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Ensure Location Services Are Off</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most apps, networks, and devices have geotagging features which means your whereabouts can be widely communicated if your location&#8217;s services are turned on. And don’t forget that digital photos can also give away your location as they contain metadata which is information about the time, date, and GPS coordinates of where the pic was taken. So, your job here is simple – ensure all devices have geotagging turned off. And while you’re at it, ensure your kids understand why it’s critical to keep it that way! Nothing worse than pesky strangers knowing your whereabouts!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Security Software</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Not having security software installed on your devices is no different from leaving your front door unlocked. It is essential. A top-shelf security software system will detect and shut down security attacks on your system. Many will also have a firewall that constantly filters the data that both enters and leaves your computer and will block and restrict your network from viruses and hackers. It will also keep an alert to malicious software and if detected will remove issues such as viruses, worms, and Trojans. It will also stay alert to spyware that you may unintentionally download onto your system and will block and delete it if found. See what I mean? It’s essential. Check out </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> which will give you peace of mind.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in life however there are definitely ways to minimize risk. Following the above 4 steps will have a significant positive impact on your family’s online safety and most importantly, means you can enjoy a little peace now the kids are back to school! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Online banking is for everyone. Or at least it should be.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The benefits of online banking are many for our moms, dads, and grandparents, just as they are for us. Elder adults can deposit checks, pay bills, transfer money to and from investments, and so on, all without needing to leave home. However, our parents and the older people in our lives may face a few hurdles that are holding them back. As a son, daughter, or loved one, there are things you can do to help them clear those hurdles so they can enjoy the convenience of online banking, safely and securely.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What do some of those hurdles look like? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="none">Familiarity, for one.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> Their comfort level with the internet simply may not be as high as ours. (After all, so many of us have grown up with it to some degree.) The web page layouts, transactional flows, and basic internet navigation sense that we all take for granted may still feel a touch foreign to them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="none">Another hurdle is trust.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> Many of our parents simply know and have come to trust, in-person and face-to-face interactions, particularly at a bank. Simply put, they may be far more trusting of the teller behind the window than the web page on the browser.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meanwhile, the digital world continues to evolve apace, particularly with regard to online banking. </span><span data-contrast="none">Between 2018 and 2022, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/946109/digital-banking-users-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the number of people in the U.S. who use online banking steadily rose to more than 65%</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2614/mobile-banking/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">more than three-quarters of Americans used a mobile device the last time they checked their balance</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. And as of 2020, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228757/online-banking-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">nearly two billion people worldwide used online banking</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a number that only continues to increase.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This rise in online banking has implications for the elders in our lives. Even if they aren’t active in online banking themselves, their financial information is part of this digital mix. The banks and financial institutions where they keep their savings and funds are digitally connected and digitally accessible. At a minimum, this means that they should take steps to protect themselves and their finances. Yet the upside is here is that we can help them do much more than that—that we can actually help them take advantage of online banking and enjoy its benefits.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Setting up online banking for mom and dad—start with the basics</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Depending on their comfort level, you may want to start by reviewing some basic digital literacy before diving right into online banking. As mentioned above, there’s so much about the internet that we take for granted, and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/helping-older-adults-build-strong-digital-literacy-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the elders in your life may benefit a little 101-level introduction to the internet</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you’re both confident that their comfort level with the internet is in the right place, you can move on to the next step—making sure mom and dad have solid online protection in place. This is square one before going online, particularly when you’re banking online. Some basic digital hygiene will help protect their banking and finances. Moreover, it will help protect the other things they do online as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The following quick list is a great way to make them far more secure:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Update their software</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That includes the operating system of their computers, smartphones, and tablets, along with the apps that are on them. Many updates include security upgrades and fixes that make it tougher for hackers to launch an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Lock up</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Computers, smartphones, and tablets will have a way of locking them using a PIN, a password, a fingerprint, or the owner’s face. Take advantage of that protection, which is particularly important if that device is lost or stolen. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Learn about tracking and wiping smartphones </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is important should they lose their smartphone or believe it’s been stolen. Have them turn on device tracking so that they can locate their phone or even wipe its data and contents remotely if they need to. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide for remotely wiping devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Use online protection software</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your devices with comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> will defend them against the latest virus, malware, spyware and ransomware attacks plus help steer them clear of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-spot-fake-login-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing attacks and malicious websites</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> designed to steal personal and financial information. Also, make sure it offers a password manager like ours does, which can create and store strong, unique passwords for each of their accounts—alleviating the burden of mom and dad remembering them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) Look into an identity protection service </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all the personally identifiable information (PII) we create simply by using the internet, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">tracking and monitoring your PII is essential for preventing identity fraud and theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The same is true for mom and dad. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A strong identity theft protection package</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> will offer cyber monitoring that can detect the misuse of your PII</span><span data-contrast="none">. Our identity protection service takes that protection a step further</span><span data-contrast="auto"> if the unfortunate happens with $1M coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Take it in steps</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With their devices and PII more secure, you can move on to the banking portion itself. While there’s so much you can do with online banking, it’s a good idea to take things one at a time. Some elders aren’t sure how to sign up for online banking with their financial institution, so you can start there. Take them through the setup process (using that strong, unique password as mentioned above) and simply get them going. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">From there, they can familiarize themselves with the layout of banking site or app they’re using. A straightforward task like checking account balances is a great way to do just that. After their comfort level with the site or app tales root, you can move on to other things they can do online, like pay bills online, deposit a paper check with their phone, and review their statements for any discrepancies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Be ready to lend an ear and a hand</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another thing that may help put your folks at ease is to let them know you’re there to help. Questions will inevitably come up, and it’ll be a great comfort to them knowing that you’re around to lend them a quick answer as needed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, let’s talk about spotting possible discrepancies in their statements. </span><span data-contrast="none">Some account entries may look a little strange because the name of a business does not always match the way it</span><a href="https://www.fiscaltiger.com/whats-this-charge-on-my-credit-card-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> appears in a bank or credit card statement</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This may lead to questions about the purchase—was it something they made? Is it a legitimate charge? These are answers you can help them track down.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Related, online banking provides our parents with a powerful tool against identity theft and fraud. By reviewing account statements closely, they can potentially spot bogus charges and purchases before they become a larger, and more costly, problem. (For a great primer on the topic, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/whats-the-difference-between-identity-fraud-and-identity-theft/"><span data-contrast="none">read and share this article that covers identity theft and fraud, along with steps to prevent it</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Call on the experts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Several different banks offer resources specifically for elder bankers. The offerings will of course vary from bank to bank, yet you may find that they have videos and information on their websites designed to make online banking easier. Likewise, they may offer special services that mom and dad may qualify for. In all, feel free to lean on their bank for assistance as needed. They’re there to help.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can also look into independent resources as well, such as the </span><a href="https://www.aarp.org/search/?q=online%20banking&amp;c=everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">AARP</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and “</span><a href="https://www.readysetbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Ready, Set, Bank</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">,” which both provide a wealth of videos and articles about online banking.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As kids, grandkids, and younger loved ones, there’s plenty we can do to help the elders in our lives enjoy online banking with confidence. Shoring up their security, starting them easy, and then being there to answer questions can help them clear the hurdles of familiarity and trust they face.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just as they’ve guided you through the ins and outs of life, here’s a chance to return the favor. What’s more, it’s yet another way you can spend time together, whether in person or over a call. And that’s a good thing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="none">Seems like the internet follows us wherever we go nowadays, whether it tags along via a smartphone, laptop, tablet, a wearable, or some combination of them all. Yet there’s something else that follows us around as well—our PII, a growing body of “personally identifiable information” that we create while banking, shopping, and simply browsing the internet. And no doubt about it, our PII is terrifically valuable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What makes it so valuable? It’s no exaggeration to say that your PII is the key to your digital life, along with your financial and civic life as well. Aside from using it to create accounts and logins, it’s further tied to everything from your bank accounts and credit cards to your driver’s license and your tax refund. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Needless to say, your PII is something that needs protecting, so let’s take a look at several ways you can do just that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is PII?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What is PII? It’s information about you that others can use to identify you either directly or indirectly. Thus, that info could identify you on its own, or it could identify you when it’s linked to other identifiers, like the ones associated with the devices, apps, tools, and protocols you use. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A prime example of direct PII is your tax ID number because it’s unique and directly associated with your name. Further instances include your facial image to unlock your smartphone, your medical records, your finances, and your phone number because each of these can be easily linked back to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Then there are those indirect pieces of PII that act as helpers. While they may not identify you on their own, a few of them can when they’re added together. These helpers include things like internet protocol addresses, the unique device ID of your smartphone, or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can also find pieces of your PII in the accounts you use, like your Google to Apple IDs, which can be linked to your name, your email address, and the apps you have. You’ll also find it in the apps you use. For example, there’s PII in the app you use to map your walks and runs, because the combination of your smartphone’s unique device ID and GPS tracking can be used in conjunction with other information to identify who you are, not to mention where you typically like to do your 5k hill days. The same goes for messenger apps, which can collect how you interact with others, how often you use the app and your location information based on your IP address, GPS information, or both.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, there’s a cloud of PII that follows us around as we go about our day online. Some wisps of that cloud are more personally identifying than others. Yet gather enough of it and PII can create a high-resolution snapshot of you—who you are, what you’re doing when you’re doing it, and even where you’re doing it too—particularly if it gets into the wrong hands.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Remember Pig-Pen, the character straight from the old funny pages of Charles Schultz’s Charlie Brown? He’s hard to forget with that ever-present cloud of dust following him around. Charlie Brown once said, “He may be carrying the soil that trod upon by Solomon or Nebuchadnezzar or Genghis Khan!” It’s the same with us and our PII, except the cloud surrounding us, isn’t the dust of kings and conquerors, they’re motes of digital information that are of tremendously high value to crooks and bad actors—whether for purposes of identity theft or invasion of privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your PII protects your identity and privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With all PII we create and share on the internet, that calls for protecting it. Otherwise, our PII could fall into the hands of a hacker or identity thief and end up getting abused, in potentially painful and costly ways.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Here are several things you can do to help ensure that what’s private stays that way:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Use a complete security platform that can also protect your privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Square One is to </span><span data-contrast="auto">protect your devices with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. This will defend you against the latest virus, malware, spyware, and ransomware attacks plus further protect your privacy and identity. In addition to this, it can also provide strong password protection by generating and automatically storing complex passwords to keep your credentials safer from hackers and crooks who may try to force their way into your accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Further, security software can also include a firewall that blocks unwanted traffic from entering your home network, such as an attacker poking around for network vulnerabilities so that they can “break-in” to your computer and steal information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Use a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Also known as a virtual private network, a VPN helps protect your vital PII and other data with bank-grade encryption. The VPN encrypts your internet connection to keep your online activity private on any network, even public networks. Using a public network without a VPN can increase your cybersecurity risk because others on the network can potentially spy on your browsing and activity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re new to the notion of using a VPN, check out this article on </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/are-you-still-on-the-fence-about-a-family-vpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">VPNs and how to choose one</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> so that you can get the best protection and privacy possible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) Keep a close grip on your Social Security Number</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the U.S., the Social Security Number (SSN) is one of the most prized pieces of PII as it unlocks the door to employment, finances, and much more. First up, keep a close grip on it. Literally. Store your card in a secure location. Not your purse or wallet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Certain businesses and medical practices may ask you for your SSN for billing purposes and the like. You don’t have to provide it (although some businesses could refuse service if you don’t), and you can always ask if they will accept some alternative form of information. However, there are a handful of instances where an SSN is a requirement. These include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Financial and real estate transactions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Applying for credit cards, car loans, and so forth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Be aware that hackers often get a hold of SSNs because the organization holding that information gets hacked or compromised itself. Minimizing how often you provide your SSN can offer an extra degree of protection.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4) Protect your files</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your files with encryption is a core concept in data and information security, and thus it’s a powerful way to protect your PII. It involves transforming data or information into code that requires a digital key to access it in its original, unencrypted format. For example, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> includes File Lock, which is our file encryption feature that lets you lock important files in secure digital vaults on your device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, you can also delete sensitive files with an application such as McAfee Shredder<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, which securely deletes files so that thieves can’t access them. (Quick fact: deleting files in your trash doesn’t actually delete them in the truest sense. They’re still there until they’re “shredded” or otherwise overwritten such that they can’t be restored.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5) Steer clear of those internet “quizzes”</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Which Marvel Universe superhero are you? Does it really matter? After all, such quizzes and social media posts are often grifting pieces of your PII in a seemingly playful way. While you’re not giving up your SSN, you may be giving up things like your birthday, your pet’s name, your first car … things that people often use to compose their passwords or use as answers to common security questions on banking and financial sites. The one way to pass this kind of quiz is not to take it!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">6) Be on the lookout for phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A far more direct form of separating you from your PII are phishing attacks. Posing as emails from known or trusted brands, financial institutions, or even a friend or family member a cybercrook’s phishing attack will attempt to trick you into sharing important information like your logins, account numbers, credit card numbers, and so on under the guise of providing customer service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">How do you spot such emails? Well, it’s getting a little tougher nowadays because scammers are getting more sophisticated and can make their phishing emails look nearly legitimate. However, </span><span data-contrast="auto">there are several ways you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-spot-fake-login-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">spot a phishing email and phony web </span></a><span data-contrast="none">pages</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as outlined here</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security offers another layer of prevention, in this case by offering browser protection like our own Web Advisor, which will alert you in the event you come across suspicious links and downloads that can steal your PII or otherwise expose you to attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7) Keep mum in your social media profile</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With social engineering attacks that deceive victims by posing as people the victim knows and the way we can sometimes overshare a little too much about our lives, you can see why a social media profile is a potential goldmine for cybercriminals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Two things you can do to help protect your PII from being at risk via social media: one, think twice about what PII you might be sharing in that post or photo—like the location of your child’s school or the license plate on your car; two, set your profile to private so that only friends can see it. Review your privacy settings regularly to keep your profile information out of the public eye. And remember, nothing is 100% private on the internet. Never post anything you wouldn’t want to see shared.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">8) Look for HTTPS when you browse</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The “S” stands for secure. Any time you are shopping, banking, or sharing any kind of PII, look for “https” at the start of the web address. Some browsers will also indicate HTTP by showing a small “lock” icon. Doing otherwise on plain HTTP sites exposes your PII for anyone who cares to monitor that site for unsecured connections.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">9) Lock your devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">By locking your devices, you protect yourself that much better from PII and data theft in the event your device is lost, stolen, or even left unattended for a short stretch. Use your password, PIN, facial recognition, thumbprint ID, what have you. Just lock your stuff. In the case of your smartphones, </span><span data-contrast="auto">read up on how you can locate your phone or even wipe it remotely if you need to. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide for remotely wiping devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">10) Keep tabs on your credit—and your PII</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Theft of your PII can of course lead to credit cards and other accounts being opened falsely in your name. What’s more, it can sometimes be some time before you even become aware of it, until perhaps your credit score takes a hit or a bill collector comes calling. By checking your credit, you can address any issues that come up, as companies typically have a clear-cut process for contesting any fraud. You can get a free credit report in the U.S. via the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and likewise, other nations like the UK have similar free offerings as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Consider identity theft protection as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A strong identity theft protection package pairs well with keeping track of your credit and offers cyber monitoring that scans the dark web to detect for misuse of your PII</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. With our identity protection service, we help </span><span data-contrast="auto">relieve the burden of identity theft if the unfortunate happens to you with $1M coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Stay Safe on Unsecure Networks</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The most widely known benefit of a VPN for daily use is to safeguard your device when it’s connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Coffee shops, libraries, hotels, transportation hubs, and other public places often provide courtesy internet service to visitors. Shifty characters often lurk on unprotected networks to lift </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (PII) from people handling sensitive emails, making banking transactions, or shopping online. Public Wi-Fi eavesdroppers can lift credit card numbers, addresses, birthdays, and Social Insurance Numbers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When you connect to public Wi-Fi that doesn’t have a lock icon, that’s a sign that you should toggle on your VPN. Also, even if you’re required to enter a password, be wary of any network you share with strangers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Hide Location Data</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A VPN can also hide your location data. How does this help you protect your browsing history? First, when you scramble your location, you’re likely to confuse ad networks trying to send you targeted ads. This will free your social media feeds and search engines from targeted ads that often are so accurate they seem like an invasion of privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Second, hiding your location can protect you from cybercriminals looking to mine PII. VPNs make it impossible for criminals to discover your IP address. (The internet protocol address is what ties your device to a specific local network.) When they’re visible, criminals can trace IP addresses to reveal home addresses, full names, and phone numbers: all of which are key pieces of PII that, in the wrong hands, can jeopardize your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Restrict <span class="TextRun SCXW26593298 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart SCXW26593298 BCX0">Data Snooping and Sharing</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW26593298 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While Canada and the European Union don’t allow ISPs (internet service providers) to even collect the browsing data of their customers, keep in mind that in some countries, like the U.S., ISPs can collect, store, share, and/or sell customer data. While advertisers are often the buyers of customer data, in the case of a breach, the more places your PII lives, the more likely it may be involved in a security incident. The goal is to limit the extent and number of places where your browsing history is stored.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">VPNs can scramble your online movements to the point where not even ISPs can track it. Plus, when you log out, your device doesn’t keep a record of what you did while connected to the VPN. Incognito mode on your internet browser hides your IP address, but the websites you visit still collect cookies and store data about your online whereabouts, meaning that it’s not truly private browsing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protect Your Privacy With McAfee</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>

If you guessed around 296 million watches congrats, you’re smarter than the writer of this blog! We had to use a calculator. The point is that’s the predicted size of the US wearable market by 2028 according to a recent report. That means for as much wearable tech as we have in our lives already, even more, is on the way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you own a piece of wearable tech it’s easy to understand why it’s so popular. After all, it can track our fitness, provide contextual help in daily life, and, in the case of hearing aids, even do cool things like sync with Bluetooth. As VR and AR gains a foothold who knows what other incredible tech might be headed our way by 2028? However</span><span data-contrast="none"> wearable tech also comes with certain risks. The most prominent: cybercriminals potentially gaining access to your data.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How can criminals gain access to your wearable data? </span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The weakest link in the wearables space is your mobile phone, not the actual wearable device itself. That’s because wearables tend to link to your mobile device over a short-range wireless spectrum known as “Bluetooth.” This spectrum is used to send and receive data between your wearable device and your mobile.

They can also, with the help of your wearable, track your location through GPS and record any health issues you’ve entered into your wearable. The point is: once they have permissions to your mobile device, they have a lot of control and a lot of resources.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:1,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Notifications on Chrome and Edge, both desktop browsers, are commonplace, and malicious actors are increasingly abusing this feature. McAfee <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/how-to-stop-the-popups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously blogged</a> about how to change desktop browser settings to stop malicious notifications. This blog focuses on Chrome notifications on Android mobile devices such as phones and tablets, and how McAfee Mobile Security protects users from malicious sites leveraging these notifications. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Where do these notifications come from?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most users are unaware of the source of these notifications. Permission is granted when a user clicks ‘Allow’ on a prompt within Android Chrome.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-139663" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/premium-notification-538x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="476" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/premium-notification-538x1024.png 538w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/premium-notification-158x300.png 158w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/premium-notification-68x129.png 68w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/premium-notification.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many malicious websites use language and images like the one above that entice the user to click ‘Allow’ such as ‘Just one more step! Click &#8220;Allow&#8221; to continue. Once allow is clicked, the website is added to a site permissions list, which will enable it to send notifications. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">What do they look like?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The notifications will look like a usual Android notification which you will be used to seeing such as you have a new WhatsApp message or email. To identify the source of the notification, we need to look for the application name which is like the one highlighted in the red box below. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-139684 aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/backup-popup.png" alt="" width="245" height="501" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/backup-popup.png 245w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/backup-popup-147x300.png 147w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/backup-popup-63x129.png 63w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The image above shows the notification came from Chrome and it is from the website premiumbros[.]com. This is something you should pay attention to as it will be needed when you want to stop annoying notifications. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Why are some of them malicious?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some notifications like the ones in this blog are malicious as they attempt to trick users into believing that their mobile device is infected with a virus and some action is required. When the users click the notification, Chrome will load a website which will present them with a fake warning like the example below:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Clicking either Cancel or Update Now on the above website will result in the same behavior. The browser will redirect the user to a google play store app so that they can download and install it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The malicious websites will flood your phone with several notifications. The screenshot below shows an example of this:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Why do malicious actors do this?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You may ask yourself, why do malicious actors try to get me to install a google play application? The people behind these scams receive a commission when these applications are installed on devices. They rely on deceptive tactics to trick users into installing them to maximize profits.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">How can I remove notifications?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To remove a website&#8217;s notification permission, you need to change a Chrome setting.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

After all, when you know the challenges you face, it’s easier to be confident online. In this blog, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at some leading examples of techniques that cybercriminals are using to trick or defraud you via your mobile phone. These examples are some of the more sophisticated attacks, using real logos, quality graphics, and personalized messages. We hope this provides a useful resource for protecting your digital life, mobile devices, and personal information so that you can enjoy a safe life online with your family.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals Take Their Scams to the Next Level</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals are upping their game, using personal information and high-quality graphics to make their malware look like legitimate apps or official messages. Because these attacks are successful at defrauding significant numbers of mobile users out of their money and information, more criminals will jump on this approach or expand their malicious campaigns. Let’s take a look at some of the different techniques being used by scammers to fool mobile users. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Smishing looks friendly but is just the opposite</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Mobile smishing (aka phishing text messages) are attacks using personalized greetings in text messages that pretend to be from legitimate organizations to appear more credible. These messages often link to websites with authentic logos, icons, and other graphics, prompting the user to enter personal information or download an app. Users should be extra careful about text messages from unknown sources and should go directly to the organization’s website to validate requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Mobile gaming scams pose as gamer help and cheating tools</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cheating tools and hacking apps are popular ways to get extra capabilities in mobile games. Criminals are exploiting this by promoting game hacking apps that include malicious code on legitimate messaging channels. If installed, the malware steals account credentials for social media and gaming accounts. Gamers should use caution when installing game hacks, especially if they request superuser permissions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Crypto is popular and so are scams targeting it</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrencies are providing new opportunities for mobile device attacks. The latest ploy is phony apps that promise to mine coins in the cloud for a monthly fee. Fake reviews and a low cost make them sound too good to be true—and they are. These apps just take the money without doing any coin mining. With no actual malicious code, these apps are hard to detect, so users should be suspicious of being promised hundreds or thousands of dollars of crypto coins for just a few dollars a month.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Watch out for fake messaging apps</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another attack uses a variety of fake apps with slick graphics to trick users into premium subscriptions. Hundreds of these apps promise features such as mobile games or photo editing and are supported by plenty of fake five-star reviews. When installed, the apps ask for the user’s phone number and verification PIN and use them to sign up for premium text services that direct payments to the criminals. Users should read reviews looking for vague statements, repetitive wording, and a mix of five-star and one-star ratings.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> For a deeper dive into the scams, be sure to view <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-mobile-threat-report-feb-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full report.</a></span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Protect Yourself</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While threat tactics continue to change as criminals adapt and respond to detection and enforcement techniques, there are a few steps users should take to limit their exposure and risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stay on the app stores</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While some malicious apps do make it through the app store screening process, most of the attack downloads appear to be coming from social media, fake ads, and other unofficial app sources. Before downloading something to your phone, do some quick research about the source and developer. Many of these scams have been flagged by other people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Watch requests for settings and permissions</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many malicious apps get the access they need by asking the user to grant them permission to use unrelated privileges and settings. When installing a new app, take a few moments to read these requests and deny any that seem unnecessary, especially for superuser access and accessibility services. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Update your software</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Developers are actively working to identify and address security issues. Both operating systems and apps should be frequently updated so that they have the latest fixes and security protections.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Be wary of too many five-star reviews</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals often flood their Google Play apps with fake five-star reviews. Many fake or malicious apps only have a mix of five-star and one-star reviews. The five-star ones typically have vague statements and repetitive wording, giving clues that they are submitted by bots. Compare them to the one-star reviews for insight on the app’s real capabilities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Pay attention if your phone is acting funny</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Devices that are behaving unusually may just have a basic tech issue but it can also be a sign of being hacked. Follow up when something is not quite right, check recent changes or contact tech support from the mobile device vendor or security software provider.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use security software</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Comprehensive security software across all devices, whether they are computers, tablets, or smartphones, continues to be a strong defensive measure to protect your data and privacy from cyber threats.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We hope this report helps you stay on the lookout for these and other mobile threats so you can safely and confidently enjoy your life online.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Girls and boys hit their mobile stride right about the same point in life, at age 15 where their mobile usage jumps significantly and reaches a level that they carry into adulthood, which is one of the several findings we uncovered in our global survey of parents, tweens, and teens this year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, what are tweens and teens up to on their mobile devices as they mature? And where do their parents fit in? We asked parents and kids alike. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-mcafee-consumer-mindset-survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What we found</a> gives us a look into the mobile lives of tweens and teens behind their lock screens.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Mobile is the Most Important Device—Yet Far More So for Kids than Their Parents </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span class="TextRun BCX0 SCXW166024836" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun BCX0 SCXW166024836">For starters, parents and their kids alike say that their mobile device is the most important one in their life. Parents placed mobile in their top two with their mobile device or smartphone at 59% followed their computer or laptop at 42%. Tweens and teens put their mobile device or smartphone at the top of the list as well, yet at a decisive 74% worldwide, followed by their gaming console at 68%. </span></span><span class="EOP BCX0 SCXW166024836" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>&#8220;Parents and their kids alike say that their mobile device is the most important thing in their life.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Further, tweens and teens place a higher value on their smartphones to keep them connected with friends and family. Some 59% of parents said mobile was essential in this role, whereas tweens and teens put that figure at 64%. For parents, the runner-up device for keeping connected was the computer or laptop at 42%. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-mcafee-consumer-mindset-survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yet quite interestingly</a>, tweens and teens said their second-most important device for keeping connected with others is their gaming console, at 40%, perhaps indicating gaming’s role in creating and fostering friendships today. Of course, plenty of that gaming is happening on mobile as well, with half of all tweens and teens surveyed worldwide saying that they play games on their smartphones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">It’s No Secret—Kids Will Cover Their Tracks Online. But How?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Broadly speaking, the activities kids do on their phones match up closely with what their parents think they’re doing on their phones. Yet there’s a fair share of secretive activity that happens within that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regarding general activity, parents and their tween- and teen-aged children worldwide see eye to eye when it comes to what parents think are their kids’ favorite activities on mobile are and what kids say they actually are:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, these security lapses can lead to downloaded malware, data and identity theft, illicit crypto mining apps on the device, and other attacks that can put children and families at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> For a deeper dive, you can view<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-mcafee-consumer-mindset-survey-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the full report.</a></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Misconceptions about online protection may play a role in these lax measures. This survey found that 49% of parents think a new phone is more secure than a new computer, and 59% of tweens and teens thought the new phone was more secure—both denying the reality that smartphones, and the people using them, are subject to hacks and attacks just like with any other device that connects to the internet. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Amid this climate, more than 1/3 of families reported that a child in their household had been the victim of a financial information leak and 15% stated that there’d been an attempt to steal a child’s online account or identity. With smartphones providing children with a major onramp to the internet, it follows that stronger mobile security could help prevent such attacks from happening.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting mobile devices and the family members who count on them takes on further importance when we consider that children in some nations rely heavily on their smartphones for online learning.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although using mobile for online learning was relatively low globally at 23%, parents and children in three nations reported a high rate of attending classes and courses on mobile—with India at 54%, Mexico at 42%, and Brazil at 39%, once again posing the possibility that mobile offers many children the most reliable broadband connection required for such instruction. In other words, there are households where broadband comes by way of mobile, rather than a cable or fiber connection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Something we’ve yet to mention here is how much online shopping and banking kids are doing on their mobile devices. No question, tweens and teens are doing those things too at a global rate of 25% and 12% across all age groups respectively. Not surprisingly, those numbers climb as teens approach adulthood. This serves as a reminder that our children are maturing hand-in-hand with their smartphones, which asks a few things of us as parents as they grow and adjust to their mobile world.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with all things parenting, there are moments of where you have a sense of what’s right for you and your child, yet you’re uncertain how to act on it. That’s definitely the case with smartphones and the internet in general. Despite having grown up alongside the internet over the course of our adult lives, we can still have plenty of questions.

Maybe it was on Reddit or on an influencer’s Instagram. Did other people reply to you, and were any of them unexpectedly hostile? When you&#8217;re online, a little hostility is sadly par for the course, but most people brush it off and move on to enjoy other aspects of life online. But what would you do if that unpleasant interaction went much farther than was reasonable? What if one day you discovered the most important parts of your identity had been maliciously and intentionally revealed online? Let’s talk about doxxing – what it is and how you can avoid becoming a victim of this kind of harassment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What is Doxxing?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doxxing, derived from the hacker term “dropping docs”, is internet slang for revealing someone’s identity online for the purposes of harassing them. It usually goes way beyond simply revealing someone’s email address or name and may involve </span><span data-contrast="none">personal information like a home address or workplace, SSN, financial information, phone number, pictures, texts, IP address, and other important details. The tricky thing about doxxing is that aspects of it may not be a crime, depending on what you’ve made publicly available online. However, the context in which doxxing occurs is crucial. Often it’s the first step taken to incite more severe harassment. For instance, the doxxer may not plan on taking action against their target but instead hope that someone else does. When put up against a recent Pew Research report showing that 41% of U.S. web users experience harassment in some form, it’s clear that Doxxing is a dangerous trend online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why is Doxxing so Destructive?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doxxing is a problem that’s grown in scope simply because there’s so much more data about us being kept online. Third-party services, called data brokers, capture our account info, the sites we visit, how long we spent on them, and other kinds of metadata to create profiles they then resell to advertisers. If someone gets access to these troves of data, they can reveal extremely damaging information about an individual, or data that allows a person to be damaged. For instance, with a phone number and a current address, some criminals were able to call in SWAT teams on innocent individuals. Political dissidents are often doxxed by the governments their protesting against. And on a lighter note, </span><span data-contrast="none">the adult website Ashley Madison, which promotes extramarital affairs, had their members’ data leaked online, to the embarrassment of a few public figures. </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What to Do if You’re Doxxed</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The response should be very similar to the one you’d take if your wallet was stolen. Move fast, stem the loss, and begin remediation as soon as possible. Here are some broad steps that can be taken.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">If you’ve been affected through social media, report it and get your info removed. Depending on the severity of intent, you may want to contact local law enforcement if real-world harassment is expected to result.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Revealed personal data is easily transmittable over the internet.

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Were financial accounts or your social security numbers revealed?

</ul>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect Yourself From Being Doxxed</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, not being doxxed in the first place is the ultimate goal of a proactive online protection plan.  Here’s what we recommend:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use identity theft protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:320,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft protection services help protect your data, monitor your online accounts like emails, SSNs, and more. In addition to online monitoring, they should also offer insurance and even theft remediation if the worst should occur.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Share with caution</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before you tag your location, friends, or workplace in a photo think about who has access to this information. What’s gained or lost by sharing all that info?

For a growing number of enterprises, the solution has been the deployment of a Security Service Edge (SSE). Introduced as a market category by Gartner, per our view we believe SSE is the consolidation of Secure Web Gateway (SWG), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) within a single, cloud-delivered solution for securing access to web, cloud, and private applications from any corner of the world, mitigating user and cloud threats, and protecting sensitive cloud data at rest, in transit, or in use.</p>
<p>Recognizing the significant role SSE is filling in cybersecurity, Gartner® has published its first ever Magic Quadrant<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> report for SSE. We are honored to announce that the McAfee Enterprise SSE Portfolio <strong>has been recognized as a Leader</strong> for its solution <strong>MVISION Unified Cloud Edge (UCE) </strong>in the report, positioned rightmost for <strong>“Completeness of Vision.”</strong> Our cloud-native platform is architected for the SSE market and boasts a next-gen SWG, and the industry&#8217;s first data-aware ZTNA solution, empowering our customers in their cloud and network transformations. It was also recognized as a Leader for Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers Leader for four successive years 2017–2020.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge (Source: Gartner)</em></span></p>
<p>In 2021, McAfee Enterprise SSE made several updates and additions to its MVISION UCE solution, strengthening its position as an industry expert, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly innovative Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) technology integrated with MVISION UCE for advanced threat protection, data security and visibility through unified policies.</li>
<li>Full-featured data security portfolio, including native integration of Enterprise DLP for unified data protection and incident management across cloud, web, private apps and endpoints.</li>
<li>Extensive Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) capabilities, including Shift Left scanning to detect and correct misconfigurations and drift early in the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>Support of SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) for continuous assessment of SaaS security landscape and remediating misconfigurations.</li>
<li>Presence backed by worldwide sales and support, along with a massively upgraded cloud footprint.</li>
<li>Includes comprehensive solutions, such as RBI for risky websites, across all the pricing tiers at no additional cost.</li>
<li>Rapidly expanding CASB Connect Program, which allows cloud service providers or partners to build lightweight API connections to the MVISION Cloud, leading several new service providers to adopt MVISION Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a companion report to the Magic Quadrant, Gartner has also published its <strong>Critical Capabilities report for SSE</strong>, which shares deep insights into the product capabilities of each vendor based on a specific set of use cases. The below use cases are included in this year&#8217;s SSE Critical Capabilities Report:</p>
<ol>
<li>Secure Web and Cloud Usage</li>
<li>Detect and Mitigate Threats</li>
<li>Connect and Secure Remote Workers</li>
<li>Identify and Protect Sensitive Information</li>
</ol>
<p>MVISION UCE received the <strong>highest score</strong> across all four use cases, paving way for the SSE market in features and functionality. We believe our rich heritage in DLP, strong CSPM/SSPM, and deep usage of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework have been the key contributors towards our #1 position across use cases in the Critical Capabilities report.</p>
<p>We are extremely proud of the recognition for our vision and product innovation. Our singular goal is to build a more secure world.

More than 95,000 people reported about $770 million in losses to fraud initiated on social media platforms in 2021. According to the FTC, those losses account for about 25 percent of all reported losses to fraud in 2021 and represent a stunning eighteenfold increase over 2017 reported losses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

C</span><span data-contrast="none">ryptojacking is illegally accessing another person’s computer power to mine cryptocurrency. Cybercriminals do this by getting a victim to click on a malicious link delivered via direct message, a news story, or an ad. Once clicked, that link loads crypto mining code on the victim’s computer or leads them to an infected website or online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once it&#8217;s loaded in the victim’s browser. Often the malware goes undetected, and the only way a victim might know their system has been compromised is that it may start performing more slowly.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

It’s proven now to be more than a passing hobby or trend. Cryptocurrency is a way of conducting business and making money for people around the world. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the intrigue and interaction with crypto grows, cybercriminals are finding new ways to exploit the system. According to CNBC, a recent crypto hack resulted in the loss of over $320 million across two major blockchain networks.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Here’s what you need to know about this latest breach, plus some tips on how you can protect your crypto assets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Down the Wormhole</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s more than one kind of cryptocurrency, and many users spread out their investments across various currencies and blockchain ecosystems. To link their activities, some crypto users employ a type of bridging software that can easily connect their different accounts. Wormhole is a popular bridge that allows users to freely move their tokens and NFTs between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In this recent crypto hack, a cybercriminal installed a bug that minted 120,000 fake currency on the Solana side of the Wormhole bridge. Then, the criminal transferred 120,000 counterfeit currency to the Ethereum side to claim Ethereum tokens. This resulted in the hacker gaining at least $251 million worth of Ethereum, nearly $47 million in Solana, and upwards of $4 million in USDC, a third type of cryptocurrency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Wormhole team offered the hacker $10 million to return the stolen currency and explain how they executed the hack. Wormhole has since tweeted that they’ve restored all stolen funds and that the system is now back to normal. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Experts think they have successfully reverse-engineered the exploit and suspect that the attacker gained access through bypassing the verify signature process.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Staying Safe From Crypto Losses</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As cryptocurrencies continue to take the world by storm, it’s key that users learn how to engage with this emerging industry safely. Even though the Wormhole breach affected the crypto platforms and not individual users, this incident is a reminder to be diligent about your crypto safety. Check out these tips to help you protect your crypto investments:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Do your research.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like with any process that involves investing your own, hard-earned money, you should be diligent about researching every cryptocurrency, blockchain, and accompanying software you use. Never trust your money to a product or service that you’re not completely confident in their security protocols. Keep up with national and world news and crypto-specific news outlets to stay on top of the latest security breaches and to gather tips on which system may be the safest option for you. When jumping into cryptocurrency, make sure that any </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/do-the-benefits-of-bitcoin-outweigh-the-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">benefits outweigh the risks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Secure your accounts.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with all your online accounts, protect your cryptocurrency logins with secure, unique passwords and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">two-factor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Never reuse passwords, since it’s possible for wily cybercriminals to buy lists of login and password combinations on the dark web. Two-factor authentication often makes it impossible for anyone to break into your account, as it requires a randomly generated passcode for entry. Passcodes are often sent by text or through a smartphone application. Sometimes it’s difficult to remember all your passwords, so consider trusting them to a password manager, such as </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. An online account locked behind a secure password and two-factor authentication will likely frustrate a cybercriminal and cause them to move along, keeping your account safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Use a hardware wallet.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Add an extra layer of protection to your crypto assets with a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet stores private keys that are necessary to unlock your blockchain accounts. This device is compatible with various blockchains and helps back up and protect your investments, even if your device is compromised by malware or a phishing attack. Hardware wallets are often protected by PINs and a passphrase, so even if the device is lost or stolen, you can feel confident in the safety of your crypto accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Check your accounts regularly.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Make it part of your weekly routine to check in on your crypto account to ensure that there are no suspicious transactions. Keep the pulse on the news, so that whenever there’s a breach, you can make a timely report of any losses you may have experienced. Also, consider changing your login credentials to be on the safe side.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Boost Your Crypto Confidence</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The only way to enjoy your cryptocurrency experience is to be confident in it. While the Wormhole loophole was almost impossible for a casual everyday user to predict, as long as you have a contingency plan and safeguards in place, you can be confident in your crypto activities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

And as a mum of 4, I’ve had my fair share. Whether it&#8217;s friendship issues, homework problems or just picking up the pieces after some bad choices – I feel like my job as a mother is most tested when I’m helping my boys navigate the tough stuff. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But after clocking up 25 years of parenting, I’ve learned one thing – when you’re in the thick of issues with your kids, being calm (even on the outside) is the best way of getting to the bottom of an issue, and helping them solve it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Kids Don’t Differentiate Between Their Online and Offline Life</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even though we may compartmentalize our lives into offline and online, our kids don’t. For them, it’s the same thing! They use their online life to set up their online activities. In fact, their online life is a critical element of their day-to-day lives. So, if a problem arises online – an embarrassing photo is shared or they make a wrong move – it can feel like their whole world is affected. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">‘That is – I’m Taking The Devices Away’</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I don’t know how many times I’ve wanted to scream this from my lungs when my boys have found themselves in tricky online situations over the years. And I am sure I am not alone. When our kids come to us with an online issue, all we want to do is throw the router in the bin or cancel their phone plan. But, that, my friends, is the worst think you can do. If your kids think there is even a small chance you’ll remove their technology, then I promise you that they will never come to you with an online issue. They would much rather try and work it out themselves than threaten disconnection because their online world is their entire world.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">My Top Tips On Navigating Online Issues With Your Kids</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Remain Calm</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Without a doubt, THE most important thing you can do for your kids is to guarantee that you will NOT scream, shout or disconnect them from their devices if they come to you with a problem. Even though you know it will be tough, promising them that you will remain calm will mean they are far more likely to seek your advice when things are tough. Of course, I am not suggesting that you don’t deal out punishments or introduce new rules as a result of the issue but remaining approachable is key.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Be Empathetic</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Being a teenager in this digital era is completely different from the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s. So, while some of the issues your kids may experience may mirror yours, many will not. Thankfully, we didn’t have the constant pressure that social media can be when we were growing up. Some kids can rationalize the way social media works and not lose any sleep over it whereas others will find it much trickier to navigate. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, take a minute to really understand their social media-dominated world. Many kids, understandably, struggle when comparing themselves to someone’s perfectly curated Instagram feed; feel lonely or ‘less than’ when discovering that their friends are all out (thanks to a shared pic online) but they weren’t invited; or, consumed by the number of likes their posts achieve. As the great Atticus Finch in ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ said ‘You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” So, try as hard as you can to understand how these pressures can affect their mindset. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Make A Plan</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When things are tricky and overwhelming, making a plan can help direct the angst and reduce the worry. Depending on the issue your child is having online, you may want to introduce some new rules around the time and place they can use their device. For example, if devices were not yet banned from the bedroom – this could be a good place to start. You could also insist devices are placed in a ‘charging zone’ on the kitchen bench overnight so their bedroom becomes a tech-free zone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, if you are worried your child is experiencing concerning levels of anxiety or low mood as a result of the situation, you might want to include making an appointment with the counselor at school or an independent psychologist. Also, notifying the school may also be a helpful action point for the plan too – depending again on the nature of the issue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If I’m being honest, being calm and chilled is probably not my natural state. I could blame it on genetics or maybe the amount of caffeine I consume but when it comes to my helping my boy with the tricky stuff, I dig deep. I channel my inner yogi and muster up all the patience and chilled vibes I can because it’s so worth it. Knowing my boys understand they can come to me about any problem – online or offline – means they know someone always has their back. And isn’t that our job as parents? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s just cases of reported fraud. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of the roughly 95,000 cases tallied in 2021, the actual number of reports and losses are arguably much higher because fraud victims infrequently report these crimes to the FTC or other agencies. Likewise, few take advantage of the </span><a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">FTC’s resources for recovering from fraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Instead, </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3852323" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">they’ll share the sad news with family or friends if anyone at all</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite the rise of these online crimes, there are several things you can do to increase your awareness of social media fraud—what it looks like and how it’s pulled off—along with other ways you can prevent scammers from targeting you and the ones you care about.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What does social media fraud look like?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Several types of social media fraud abound, yet the FTC reports that three types of scams prevail:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Investment scams </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These often involve bogus sites that promote opportunities to mine or invest in cryptocurrencies. Rather than use these sites to trade in legitimate cryptocurrencies, scammers use these as a front to collect funds. The funds are never invested and never returned. Thanks to social media, scammers have a quick and easy way to drive victims to such bogus sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Romance scams</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By starting up a chat through </span><span data-contrast="none">an unexpected friend request or a message that comes out of the blue, a scammer develops a budding romantic relationship with a victim—and eventually starts asking for money. Public social media profiles are particularly attractive to scammers because they’re loaded with information that scammers can use to win a victim’s confidence or heart.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Online shopping scams </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Using ads on social media, scammers drive victims to phony online stores that will take people’s money but that don’t deliver the goods. They’re simply a way for scammers to harvest cash from unsuspecting shoppers. These sites may impersonate reputable brands and stores or they may sell bogus products altogether. Either way, victims pay and receive nothing in return.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Together, these three types of scams accounted for the overwhelming majority of losses and reports of social media fraud, which are broken down in detail as follows:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-137815" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-1024x525.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-768x393.jpg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-1536x787.jpg 1536w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses-205x105.jpg 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chart_toplosses.jpg 1583w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As illustrated, investment and romance scams may get reported less frequently, yet they are among the costliest scams going on social media. Meanwhile, online shopping scams on social media are far more common yet rake in fewer dollars overall. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What makes social media such a happy hunting ground for scammers?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For one, reach. </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/260811/social-network-penetration-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Nearly half of the global population uses social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> today. That translates into billions of people who can be made into potential victims. Secondly, social media provides the tools to reach those people through the otherwise legitimate services and features available to the people and businesses that use social media to connect. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of investment and shopping scammers, the ad platforms are of particular use. For romance scammers, direct messaging and profile pages are potential avenues for fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Targeted ad platforms can be used to target victims</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers use the highly targeted ad platform that social media companies use to generate revenue. With millions of detailed user profiles in their data stores, social media companies put that data to work in their ad platforms allow businesses to create ads designed to reach specific age groups, hobbies and interests, past purchases, and so on. Just as easily, a scammer can use the same tools to cook up bogus ads for their bogus products, services, and sites at a relatively low cost.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, a scammer could target older females with an interest in investing. From there, the scammer could narrow down that target profile to those who live in areas of the country with a desired average income level, and who have shown interest in investment products before. The scammers would create an ad that takes them to phony website designed to entice that target group into purchasing a bogus product, service, or crypto. The FTC reports that the median loss for an online shopping scam in 2021 was $118, while online investment scams on social media racked up a median loss of $1,800 per victim. These stats make a strong case for sticking to reputable and established retailers and accredited financial services.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">People love to share, and scammers love to turn that against their victims </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of romance scammers on social media, the posts and personal profiles that form the heart of social media offer con artists a treasure trove. With a potential victim’s life a relatively open book, full of birthdays, events, interests, and activities for all to see, scammers have the hooks they need to form a phony romantic relationship online—or at least make the attempt at one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, a scammer reaches out to a potential victim with a friend request. With the profile and posts this romance scammer has at hand, they can spin all manner of intriguing, yet utterly false tales designed to gain the victim’s trust. With that trust established, they can follow up with a similarly intriguing story about needing “a little help” to cover some “unexpected expenses,” often in the form of a gift card or reloadable debit card—sometimes stringing out a series of requests over time. According to the FTC, the median loss for this type of romance scam in 2021 was around $2,000 per victim.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Six steps for preventing social media scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">People worldwide spend an average of 145 minutes a day on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. And with users in the U.S. spending just over two hours on social media a day, that’s a great deal of potential exposure to scams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet, whether you’re using Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or whatnot, here are several things you can do that can help keep you safe and secure out there:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Set strong, unique passwords</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Passwords mark square one in your protection, with strong and unique passwords across all your accounts forming primary line of defense. Yet with all the accounts we have floating around, juggling dozens of strong and unique passwords can feel like a task—thus the temptation to use (and re-use) simpler passwords. Hackers love this because one password can be the key to several accounts. Instead, try a password manager that can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Go private</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting, which can help protect your privacy and give a possible scammer much less material to work with.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be critical of the invitations you receive. Out-and-out strangers could be more than just a stranger, they could be a fake account designed to gather information on users for purposes of fraud. There are plenty of fake accounts too. In fact, in Q3 of 2021 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.8 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Reject such requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Watch out for phishing scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re increasingly accustomed to the warnings about phishing emails, yet phishing attacks happen plenty on social media. The same rules apply. Don’t follow any links you get from strangers by way of instant or direct messages. And keep your personal information close. Don’t pass out your email, address, or other info as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/quizzes-and-other-identity-theft-schemes-to-avoid-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Even those so-called “quiz” posts and websites can be ruses designed to steal bits and pieces of personal info that can be used as the basis of an attack.</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Do a background check—on businesses and people</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you’re purchasing online, do some quick research on the company. How long have they been around? Have any complaints been recorded by your </span><a href="https://www.consumerresources.org/file-a-complaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">attorney general</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://www.usa.gov/local-governments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">local consumer protection agency</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">? When you meet someone new, do a reverse image search on their profile pic to see where else it appears. Look up their name in search as well. If the results you find don’t match up with the person’s story, it may be a sign of a scam.</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Protect yourself and your devices</span></b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-137857 alignleft" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/protec-score.png" alt="" width="203" height="177" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/protec-score.png 203w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/protec-score-148x129.png 148w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">Online protection software can protect you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from clicking on malicious links while on social media while steering you clear of other threats like viruses, ransomware, and phishing attacks.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It&#8217;s unfortunate seeing a resource we’ve come to know and love over the past years get taken advantage of this way.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One important note is to strongly consider filing a report if you believe you’ve been a victim of a social media scam.

So whether filing a report will help you recover some or all your losses, it can provide information to businesses and agencies that can help keep it from happening to others. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/02/romance-scams-take-record-dollars-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the reported costs of online romance scams jumped 50% from 2019 to 2020, to the tune of $304 million</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. And that’s not entirely because 2020 was a pandemic year. From 2016 to 2020, the volume of reported cases tripled, while reported losses nearly quadrupled. Over that period, online romance scams are not only becoming more common, but they’re also becoming more costly.</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136639 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam.jpg" alt="" width="1583" height="898" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam.jpg 1583w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RomanceScam-205x116.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1583px) 100vw, 1583px" /> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How do online dating and romance scams get started?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Dating and romance scams aren’t limited to online dating apps and sites, they’ll happen on social media and in online games as well. However, the FTC reports that the scam usually starts the same way, typically through an unexpected friend request or a message that comes out of the blue. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that initial introduction made, a chat begins, and a friendship (or more) blossoms from there. Along the way, the scammer will often rely on a mix of somewhat exotic yet believable storytelling to lure the victim in, often involving their job and where they’re working. Reports say that scammers will talk of being workers on an offshore oil rig, members of the military stationed overseas, doctors working with an international organization, or working in the sort of jobs that would prevent them from otherwise easily meeting up in person.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With the phony relationship established, the scammer starts asking for money. The FTC reports that they’ll ask for money for several bogus reasons, usually revolving around some sort of hardship where they need a “little help” so that they can pay:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">For a plane ticket or other travel expenses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">For medical expenses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Customs fees to retrieve something.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Gambling debts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">A visa or other official travel documents.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The list goes on, yet that’s the general gist. Scammers often employ a story with an intriguing complication that seems just reasonable enough, one where the romance scammer makes it sound like they could really use the victim’s financial help.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Common types of online dating scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">People who have filed fraud reports say they’ve paid their scammer in a few typical ways. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One is by wiring money, often through a wire transfer company. The benefit of this route, for the scammer anyway, is that this is as good as forking over cash. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. The victim lacks the protections they have with other payment forms, such as a credit card that allows the holder to cancel or contest a charge.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another way is through gift cards. Scammers of all stripes, not just romance scammers, like these because they effectively work like cash, whether it’s a gift card for a major online retailer or a chain of brick-and-mortar stores. Like a wire transfer, once that gift card is handed over, the money on it is highly difficult to recover, if at all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One more common payment is through reloadable debit cards. A scammer may make an initial request for such a card and then make several follow-on requests to load it up again. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, a romance scammer will typically look for the easiest payment method that’s the most difficult to contest or reimburse, leaving the victim in a financial lurch once the scam ends.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How Do You Avoid Getting Tangled Up in an Online Dating or Romance Scam?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When it comes to </span><span data-contrast="auto">meeting new people online, the FTC suggests the following:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Never send money or gifts to someone you haven’t met in person—even if they send you money first.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Talk to someone you trust about this new love interest. It can be easy to miss things that don’t add up. So pay attention if your friends or family are concerned.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Take the relationship slowly. Ask questions and look for inconsistent answers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Try a reverse-image search of any profile pictures the person uses. If they’re associated with another name or with details that don’t match up, it’s a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Scammers, although arguably heartless, are still human. They make mistakes. The stories they concoct are just that. Stories. They may jumble their details, get their times and dates all wrong, or simply get caught in an apparent lie. Also, keep in mind that some scammers may be working with several victims at once, which is yet another opportunity for them to get confused and slip up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protecting Yourself Further From Scams on Your Social Media Accounts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As mentioned above, some romance scammers troll social media and reach out through a direct message or friend request. With that, there are three things you can do to cut down your chances of getting caught up with a scammer:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Go private</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting, which can help protect your privacy and give a romance scammer less information to exploit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be critical of the invitations you receive. Out-and-out strangers could be more than a romance scammer, they could be a fake account designed to gather information on users for purposes of cybercrime, or they can be an account designed to spread false information. There are plenty of them too. In fact, in Q3 of 2021 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.8 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Reject such requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Protect yourself and your devices</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Security software can protect you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from clicking on malicious links that a scammer may send you online, while also steering you clear of other threats like viruses, ransomware, and phishing attacks in general. It can look out for your personal information as well, by protecting your privacy and monitoring your email, SSN, bank accounts, credit cards, and other info that a scammer or identity thief may put to use. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/id-theft-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With identity theft a rather commonplace occurrence today</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, security software is really a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Put an End to it</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you suspect that you’re being scammed, put an end to the relationship and report it, as difficult as that may feel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Notify the FTC </span><span data-contrast="none">at </span><a href="http://www.reportfraud.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for support and next steps to help you recover financially as much as possible. Likewise, notify the social media site, app, or service where the scam occurred as well. In some cases, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/top-signs-of-identity-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you may want to file a police report, which we cover in our broader article on identity theft and fraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you sent funds via a gift card, the FTC suggests filing a claim with the company as soon as possible. </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards#Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">They offer further advice on filing a claim here,</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> along with a list of contact numbers for gift card brands that scammers commonly use. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Lastly, go easy on yourself. If you find yourself a victim of online dating or romance fraud, know that you won’t be the first or last person to be taken advantage of this way. By reporting your case, you in fact may help others from falling victim too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A digital wallet, also known as a mobile wallet, is a smartphone app that stores your payment information and enables tap to pay at most point-of-sale terminals.

Now, imagine (or if you’ve been unlucky enough to lose your wallet in the past, think back to) the hassle that would ensue if someone stole your wallet or you misplaced it. Not only do you have to cancel your cards, notify your various banks, and wait for replacements, but the niggling worry that a stranger has access to your </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) will likely keep you up at night.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just like you store your wallet in your front pocket when about town and check your seat before leaving a taxi or a plane, look after your smartphone just as closely. Unlike a physical wallet, whose absence is noticed quickly, a digital wallet may be compromised by a cyber pickpocket without you knowing for a while. For example, the BBC reported that researchers found a potential shortcoming in Apple Pay’s Express Transit mode where cyber pickpockets could remotely access mobile wallets.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Luckily, the researchers’ experiment is unlikely to occur in the real world, but it’s a reminder to everyone to check their monthly bank statements for suspicious transactions. Cybercriminals get smarter and bolder by the day, so it’s not unlikely that they’ll find and exploit a digital wallet shortcoming in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Follow these tips to help you use your digital wallet more confidently. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tips to Protect Your Digital Wallet</span></b></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Set a unique passcode</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Always protect your digital wallet with a passcode! This is the best and easiest way to deter cybercriminals. It’s best if this combination of numbers is different than the passcode to your phone. Also, make sure the numbers are random. Birthdays, anniversaries, house addresses, and the last digits of your phone number are all popular combinations and are crackable codes to a resourceful criminal. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Better yet, if your mobile wallet app allows you to protect your account with facial recognition or a fingerprint scan, set it up! If your digital wallet proves difficult or impossible to enter, a cybercriminal may leave it for an easier target, keeping your PII safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Update software regularly</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way to secure your digital wallet is to make sure you always download the latest software updates. Developers are constantly finding and patching security holes, so the most up-to-date software is often the most secure. Turn on automatic updates to ensure you never miss a new release.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Download digital wallet apps directly from official websites </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before you swap your plastic cards for digital payment methods, make sure you research the digital banking app before downloading. Make sure that any app you download is through the official Apple or Android store or the financial institution’s official website. Then, check out how many downloads and reviews the app has to make sure you’re </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/fake-apps-taking-over-phone/"><span data-contrast="none">downloading an official app</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and not an imposter. While most of the apps on official stores are legitimate, it’s always best practice to check for typos, blurry logos, and unprofessional app descriptions to make sure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Be More Confident Online </span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The digital era is an exciting time to make the most of the conveniences technology affords; however, constant vigilance is key to keeping your finances and PII private. Whether you’re looking for additional peace of mind or have lost your wallet, consider signing up for an identity monitoring service like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-ca/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee identity protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="none">With a connected family, it’s important to pay attention to what your family members are connected to (IoT devices in the home, smartphones, tablets, etc.) and how they interact online. Maybe your son is an avid gamer, or your teenager is a social media mogul who enjoys tweeting and scrolling through TikTok.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_privateBrowsing.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_privateBrowsing.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_privateBrowsing-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="none">To enjoy online life to the fullest these days, we often have to give out a certain amount of personal information. That also means the moment you go online you’re giving personal data away. Whether it’s your phone, a game console, or a connected speaker, someone, somewhere, is monitoring your connection. Knowing what data your device sends, and who has access to that information, is an important part of maintaining your online privacy. However, without the right tools, you’re probably giving away a lot more information than you realize. Many believe that one effective way to maintain online privacy is by using a private mode on a browser.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, it’s a common misconception that “private browsing” modes–like Google’s Incognito–protect your online privacy. It makes sense, they&#8217;re called “private browsing”, what else would they do? Well, if you&#8217;ve read the news lately, you may have seen that </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit-idUSKBN23933H" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google is in a $5 billion lawsuit</span></a> <span data-contrast="none">specifically because of their private browsing mode. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The thing is, incognito mode is often misunderstood. When you open an incognito window, you’re told that “You’ve gone incognito.” The explanation underneath says that your browsing history, website visits, cookies, and information you put in forms, won’t be saved. This is where the confusion starts. What the incognito explanation doesn’t tell you is that your browsing information isn’t blocked or hidden from advertisers while in incognito mode. So even though your browsing information “won’t be saved” on your device or available after you close the window, that doesn’t stop the internet from seeing everything you’ve been up to while in that session. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For these reasons, more people use virtual private networks, or </span><a href="http://www.mcafeee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b><span data-contrast="none">VPNs</span></b></a><span data-contrast="none">, to protect their browsing history from prying eyes. If you’re new to </span><b><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></b><span data-contrast="none">, this might be the perfect time to learn about what they are, how they work and why you might choose a </span><b><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> over </span><b><span data-contrast="none">private</span></b> <b><span data-contrast="none">browsing</span></b><span data-contrast="none">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">What do virtual private networks do?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:320,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h2>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> protects your devices by wrapping your internet connection in a secure tunnel that only you can access. This stops people —like those nosey advertisers—from seeing what sites you visit. With a secure connection to the Internet, every search request, every website you browse, is hidden from sight. It’s important to point out that </span><b><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> doesn’t make you anonymous; they make it so only you can see what you’re doing online. You can learn even more about </span><b><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> in </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/why-everyone-needs-a-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">this blog.</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Without private browsing, your browser tells websites–and their owners–all kinds of things about you like what device you&#8217;re using, where you are, what sites you&#8217;ve visited, and when. Websites use this information to serve you relevant ads, but it can also be used to track your location and browsing habits.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With private browsing, your browser window is isolated from the rest of your operating system. Isolating the browser is supposed to help block websites from seeing who you are, block cookies and prevent access to your browsing history, but even when using private browsing, tests like </span><a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/"><span data-contrast="none">EFF&#8217;s Panopticlick privacy test</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> can see what device you&#8217;re on, where you&#8217;re connecting, if you can accept cookies, your OS, and many other types personally-identifying information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

We carry so much of our lives on our devices, from our social media accounts and photos of our pets to our banking information and home addresses. Whether it be just for fun or for occupational purposes, so much of our time and attention is spent on our smartphones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because our mobile devices carry so much valuable information, it’s important that we stay educated on the latest cyber schemes so we can be prepared to combat them and keep our data safe.  According to Bleeping Computer</span><span data-contrast="auto">, researchers have developed a trojan proof of concept tool that fakes a shutdown or reboot of iPhones, preventing malware from being removed and allowing hackers to secretly snoop on microphones and cameras. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s dive into the details of this technique. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How “</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">NoReboot</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">” allows </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">hackers to spy on a device</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Typically, when an iOS device is infected with malware, the solution is as simple as just restarting the device. However, with this new technique researchers are calling “NoReboot,” ridding a device of malware is not quite as simple.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“NoReboot” blocks the shutdown and reboot process from being carried out, preventing the device from actually restarting. Without a proper shutdown and reboot, a malware infection on an iOS device can continue to exist. Because the device appears to be shut off with a dark screen, muted notifications, and a lack of response, it is easy to assume that the device has shut down properly and the problem has been solved. However, the “NoReboot” technique has only simulated a reboot, allowing a hacker to access the device and its functions, such as its camera and microphone. If a hacker has access to these functions, they could record the user without their knowledge and potentially capture private information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As previously mentioned, smartphone usage takes up a big chunk of our time and attention. Since we are so often on these devices, it is usually fairly easy to tell when something isn’t working quite like it is supposed to. While these things could very well just be technical issues, sometimes they are much more than that, such as malware being downloaded onto your smartphone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A slower device, webpages taking way too long to load, or a battery that never keeps a charge are all things that can be attributed to a device reaching its retirement.

<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Update your phone and its apps</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Promptly updating your phone and apps is a primary way to keep your device safe. Updates often fix bugs and vulnerabilities that hackers rely on to download malware for their attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Avoid downloading from third-party app stores</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Apple’s App Store and Google Play have protections in place to help ensure that apps being downloaded are safe. Third-party sites may not have those same protections or may even be purposely hosting malicious apps to scam users. Avoiding these sites altogether can prevent these apps from allowing hackers into your device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Stay safer on the go with a VPN</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hackers may use public Wi-Fi to gain access to your device and the information you have inside of it. Using a VPN to ensure that your network is private and only you can access it is a great way to stay protected on the go.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Turn off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Turning off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them is a simple way to prevent skilled hackers from working their way into your devices.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Avoid public charging stations</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some hackers have been known to install malware into public charging stations and hack into devices while they are being charged. Investing in your own personal portable charging packs is an easy way to avoid this type of hack. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b></b><b></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Encrypt your phone</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Encrypting your phone can protect your calls, messages, and information, while also protecting you from being hacked. iPhone users can check their encryption status by going into Touch ID &amp; Passcode, scrolling to the bottom, and seeing if data protection is enabled. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Determine whether your device rebooted properly</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although researchers agree that you can never trust a device to be fully off, there are some techniques that can help you determine whether your device was rebooted correctly.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> If you do suspect that your phone was hacked or notice some suspicious activity, restart your device. To do this, press and hold the power button and either volume button until you are prompted to slide the button on the screen to power off. After the device shuts down and restarts, notice if you are prompted to enter your passcode to unlock the device. If not, this is an indicator that a fake reboot just occurred. If this happens, you can wait for the device to run out of battery, although researchers have not verified that this will completely remove the threat. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stay protected</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you are worried that your device has been hacked, follow these steps:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>In a recent campaign of Emotet, McAfee Researchers observed a change in techniques. The Emotet maldoc was using hexadecimal and octal formats to represent IP address which is usually represented by decimal formats. An example of this is shown below:</p>
<p>Hexadecimal format: 0xb907d607</p>
<p>Octal format: 0056.0151.0121.0114</p>
<p>Decimal format: 185.7.214.7</p>
<p>This change in format might evade some AV products relying on command line parameters but McAfee was still able to protect our customers. This blog explains this new technique.</p>

Right? As beneficial and convenient as tech can be, it can also pose risks to our online safety and privacy—risks that we should be prepared to handle. Increasingly, we’re seeing governments around the world implementing stricter privacy laws. And even major players like Google are phasing out invasive tracking technology like cookies. However, when it comes to activities like banking, shopping, taxes, and more, the need for broader online privacy protection has never been greater. Let&#8217;s take a look at some prominent trends in the way we now live online and how we can protect our data.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Web3</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Crypto, the blockchain, NFTs, tokens – all of these terms are considered part of what’s being termed Web3. Whereas Web 2.0 described an internet made up of large corporations hosting content and consumers, Web3 is governed by the blockchain. What this means is that applications use a decentralized online ledger to document transactions of all sorts. The most famous example is bitcoin, a blockchain that acts as a digital currency. Another example would be NFTs, which are digital works of art. Web3 may be in its infancy, but it’s important to consider what this means for privacy and data protection. Blockchain affords users anonymity in regards to currencies like bitcoin. Of course that means bitcoin also has a reputation as the currency of choice for money-launderers and other shady enterprises. Still, that means it’s good for privacy, right? Well, maybe. The EU’s GDPR rights to erase or amend data are at odds with transactions on a blockchain, which are essentially unchangeable. So if you’re buying cryptocurrency, NFTs, or interacting with blockchains in other ways, just understand your personal information might be hidden, but the record of your transactions is totally visible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tip:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> If you’re keeping cryptocurrencies in an online wallet, you’ll want to use an identity protection service to monitor those account credentials so you can be warned of breaches and leaks onto the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Education</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Student privacy is a top concern as households turn to remote learning. In a rush to optimize remote learning experiences in the face of a rapidly evolving digital landscape, many educators and remote learners may not realize the hazards that put </span><a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/teachers-turn-to-social-media-raising-privacy-concerns/586538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">student privacy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since 2020, schools have adopted a range of technologies to optimize the digital classroom, including virtual learning platforms, holistic learning solutions, and even social media applications. However, many of these digital platforms are not designed for child usage, nor do they have privacy policies in place to ensure that the student data gathered is protected. Many learning platforms may even treat student data as consumer data, raising more red flags regarding student data privacy and compliance. Online learning has also garnered the attention of cybercriminals looking to exploit student data, resulting in online bullying, identity theft, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

IT teams and educators must understand the implications of the student data they collect, govern access to it, and control its usage to comply with child privacy regulations. Parents can take proper precautions by discussing the importance of privacy with their children. Keeping learning platforms up to date and monitoring their children to prevent them from downloading suspicious apps or straying to unknown websites are all ways to ensure safer remote learning environments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tip: </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Getting a VPN for the family to use is a great way to safeguard your privacy while your kids are learning online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Work</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Remote work has become commonplace nowadays as more companies permit their employees to work from home long-term and, for some, permanently. In a recent </span><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/top-work-at-home-privacy-and-security-54930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">Fenwick poll</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> among HR, privacy, and security professionals across industries, approximately 90% of employees now handle intellectual property, confidential, and personal information in their homes. Endpoint security, or the protection of end-user devices such as our laptops and mobile devices, poses more of a concern as employees trade in office networks for their in-home Wi-Fi. If these devices and networks are unsecured or if the data is not encrypted, employees run the risk of exposing sensitive information to hackers. Those of us working from home can help ensure the safety of our company’s confidential information by boosting our awareness of security threats and prevention measures via company-mandated security training. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Metaverse</span></b></h2>
<p aria-level="3"><span data-contrast="auto">This buzzy term is being used to describe Meta’s (previously Facebook) vision for a fully connected future. Right now it exists as an AR/VR space accessible through Meta’s own VR hardware, Oculus. However, the terminology has caught on as a catch-all for platforms that may contain work, business, gaming, entertainment, social interactions, and more in one easily navigable, immersive online setting. Web3 features, like blockchain, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies are being touted as integral parts of the metaverse. As exciting and futuristic as this is, there are major privacy questions that will have to be answered. This means that as customers you’ll want to think hard about what you choose to share through the metaverse and look into the privacy settings a platform offers you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:320,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tip: </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Use comprehensive online protection. McAfee Total Protection secures all aspects of your life online. From identity to online connections to antivirus, a full security suite like Total Protection keeps you and your family safer on all the devices you use and places you go online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Personal Finances</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some of the platforms I use the most allow me to keep track of and manage my finances. Whether it’s my mobile banking app or taking advantage of online tax filing, there is such a convenience in having the ability to pay bills, deposit checks, and more, all with the devices I use every day. But many of us may not realize just how much trust we put into these platforms to protect our online privacy, especially when we don’t have a clear picture of who exactly is on the other end of our online transactions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Tip: </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Full-featured identity protection will protect you financially.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Digital devices are part of how we live our lives every day, whether we’re taking conference calls on our laptops, tracking the latest mile on our smartwatches, or banking on the go. Although our everyday digital devices make our lives that much more convenient, securing them makes our lives that much safer by minimizing online threats to ourselves and those around us. Safeguarding the digital platforms we use for work, school, finances, you name it, is the first step to ensuring our private information remains just that—private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

But what about the data that is collected by companies every time we sign up for an email newsletter or make an online account? Oftentimes, we trust these companies to guard the personal data they collect from us in exchange for the right to use their products and services. However, the personal information collected by companies today is not regarded as private by default, with a few exceptions. For this reason, it’s up to us to take our data privacy into our own hands. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Because we spend so much of our day online, plenty of our information is available on the internet. But what happens if one of your favorite online retailers experiences a data breach? This is the reality of the world we live in today, as data breaches have been on the rise and hackers are continuously finding clever, new ways to access our devices and information.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve become more reliant on technology than ever before. Whether it be for distance learning, online shopping, mobile banking, or remote work, we’ve all depended on our devices and the internet to stay connected. But with more time online comes more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit. For example, with the massive increase in remote work since the onset of the pandemic, hackers have hijacked online meetings through a technique called ‘Zoombombing</span><span data-contrast="none">4</span><span data-contrast="none">.’ This occurred after the online conferencing company shared personal data with Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn. Additionally, the number of patient records breached in the healthcare industry jumped to 21.3 million in the second half of 2020 due to the increase in remote interactions between patients and their providers</span><span data-contrast="none">5</span><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When it comes to data breaches, any business is a potential target because practically every business is online in some way. When you put this in perspective, it’s important to consider what information is being held by the companies that you buy from. While a gaming service will likely have different information about you than your insurance company, you should remember that all data has value, and you should take steps to protect it like you would money. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Here are a few more tips to keep you on top of your data privacy game: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Update your privacy and security settings</span></b><span data-contrast="none">. Begin with the websites and apps that you use the most. Check to see if your accounts are marked as private, or if they are open to the public. Also, look to see if your data is being leaked to third parties. You want to select the most secure settings available, while still being able to use these tools correctly. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Lock down your logins</span></b><span data-contrast="none">. Secure your logins by making sure that you are creating long and unique passphrases for all your accounts. Use multi-factor identification, when available.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Protect your family and friends</span></b><span data-contrast="none">. You can make a big difference by encouraging your loved ones to protect their online privacy. By helping others create solid safety habits as they build their digital footprints, it makes all of us more secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_MFE_Blogs_012622_Blog.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_MFE_Blogs_012622_Blog.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_MFE_Blogs_012622_Blog-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Sometimes, I feel that my brain is full! We are all bombarded with information on so many fronts and quite frankly, I often feel like I don’t have room for much more! A quick scroll on my socials and I’m inundated with news from friends (which I love) plus ads plus multiple news updates. I open my emails, and the same happens! So much information!! So little time!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, in the spirit of being brief and not overloading, I’m going to focus on one easy yet powerful way you can make a positive impact on your online safety – how you manage your password. Of course, I could add many more strategies to this list but let’s keep it simple – our brains are full!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why Are Passwords So Important?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Passwords are the key to everything we do online. Whether we are logging in to our emails, social media platforms, online banking, or favorite shopping websites – your password is your way in. And if you’re anything like me, you probably have multiple passwords. The last time I checked, I had over 100 different passwords stored in my </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> password manager!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These small codes are so incredibly important because in short, they are the only thing stopping a hacker from accessing your online accounts. In many cases, they are your only defense strategy against a hacker taking over your accounts and creating havoc. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Fortunately, there are several steps we can take to ensure we nail this password thing and minimize the risk of being hacked. Here are my top five:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Don’t Share Your Passwords – no exceptions!!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I have been saying to my kids for years: passwords are like toothbrushes – they are NOT to be shared! No exceptions. It doesn’t matter how much you love your best friend or girlfriend, your password is your password. When you are young and donning rose-colored glasses, you often don’t factor in that things can change. Relationships can sour and romance can die. If someone has access to your online accounts and they have hurt feelings then they have an opportunity to create chaos. And we’ve all read the stories…</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Use Different Passwords For Each Account</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yes, I agree – this is a big pain! But it is probably one of the best ways of protecting yourself and here’s why. If you use the same password for each of your online accounts and your account is hacked then the hacker has access to all of your online accounts: your social media platforms, your banking, your entire life! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Turn On 2 Factor Authentication Where Possible</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It will add another step to your login process but choosing 2-factor authentication (or multi-factor authentication) is another small yet powerful way to keep your password secure by adding another layer of protection to your passwords. In most cases, the additional factor is a code or a token sent to your mobile phone. Sometimes, a separate app can also be used to generate a code or token that will confirm it is really you trying to log in!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Create Long and Complex Passwords</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some experts believe length is more important than complexity but I say embrace both! If you can create a complex 16 character password that includes lower and upper case letters, numbers and symbols then you are doing very well! I am personally a fan of the crazy, nonsensical sentence. For example – GrassisRed&amp;Blue7 – silly, nonsensical but memorable. I believe it’s all about making them hard to guess but easy to remember. And remember to NEVER use information in your passwords that other people might know about you or that is also included in your social media accounts eg your kids’ or pet’s names.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Use A Password Manager</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I am sure my longevity has improved dramatically since using a </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">! Password managers, or vaults, are an absolute no-brainer. Not only do they store your passwords securely across your chosen devices, but they also help you create complex passwords that no human could even contemplate. I have it installed on both my laptop and my phone and it works seamlessly between both devices. It’s time to throw away your little black book of passwords, people! You’ll never look back once this whole password management process is automated.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed at where to start with your digital safety this New Year then I implore you to make this one small change. Nailing your password strategy is without doubt one of the best ways of shoring up your online safety! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Happy New Year!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Can Apple Macs get viruses?</p>
<p>While Apple does go to great lengths to keep all its devices safe, this doesn’t mean your Mac is immune to all computer viruses. So what does Apple provide in terms of antivirus protection? Let’s take a look along with some signs that your Mac may be hacked and how you can protect yourself from further threats beyond viruses, like identity theft.</p>
<h2><strong>Signs that your Mac may be hacked</strong></h2>
<p>Whether hackers physically sneak it onto your device or by tricking you into installing it via <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/before-you-download-steer-clear-of-malicious-mobile-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a phony app</a>, a sketchy website, or a phishing attack, viruses and malware can create problems for you in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keylogging:</strong> In the hands of a hacker, keylogging works like a stalker by snooping information as you type.</li>
<li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Trojans are type of malware that can be disguised in your computer to extract important data, such as credit card account details or personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptominers:</strong> Similar to trojans, this software hides on a device. From there, it harnesses the device’s computing power to “mine” cryptocurrencies. While cryptomining is not illegal, “<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-reports/bitcoin-mining-security-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptojacking</a>” a device without the owner’s consent is most certainly illegal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some possible signs of hacking software on your Mac include:</p>
<h3><strong>Performance issues</strong></h3>
<p>Is your device operating more slowly, are web pages and apps harder to load, or does your battery never seem to keep a charge? These are all signs that you could have malware running in the background, zapping your device’s resources.</p>
<h3><strong>Your computer feels like it’s running hot</strong></h3>
<p>Like the performance issues above, malware or mining apps running in the background can burn extra computing power (and data). Aside from sapping performance, malware and mining apps can cause your computer to run hot or even overheat.</p>
<h3><strong>Mystery apps or data</strong></h3>
<p>If you find apps you haven’t downloaded, along with messages and emails that you didn’t send, that’s a red flag. A hacker may have hijacked your computer to send messages or to spread malware to your contacts. Similarly, if you see spikes in your data usage, that could be a sign of a hack as well.</p>
<h3><strong>Pop-ups or changes to your screen</strong></h3>
<p>Malware can also be behind spammy pop-ups, changes to your home screen, or bookmarks to suspicious websites. In fact, if you see any configuration changes you didn’t personally make, this is another big clue that your computer may have been hacked.</p>
<h2><strong>What kind of antivirus do Macs have?</strong></h2>
<p>Macs contain <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several built-in features</a> that help protect them from viruses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XProtect and Automatic Quarantine: </strong>XProtect is Apple’s proprietary antivirus software that’s been included on all Macs since 2009. Functionally, it works the same as any other antivirus, where it scans files and apps for malware by referencing a database of known threats that Apple maintains and updates regularly. From there, suspicious files are quarantined by limiting their access to the Mac’s operating system and other key functions. However, .</li>
<li><strong>Malware Removal Tool:</strong> To further keep Apple users protected, the Malware Removal Tool (MRT) scans Macs to spot and catch any malware that may have slipped past XProtect. Similar to XProtect, it relies on a set of constantly updated definitions that help identify potential malware. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Apple</a>, MRT removes malware upon receiving updated information, and it continues to check for infections on restart and login.</li>
<li><strong>Notarization, Gatekeeper, and the App Review Process: </strong>Another way Apple keeps its users safe across MacOS and iOS devices is its <em>Notarization</em> Apps built to run on Apple devices go through an initial review before they can be distributed and sold outside of Apple’s App Store. When this review turns up no instances of malware, Apple issues a Notarization ticket. That ticket is recognized in another part of the MacOS, Gatekeeper, which verifies the ticket and allows the app to launch. Additionally, if a previously approved app is later to found to be malicious, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-notarized-mac-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple can revoke its Notarization</a> and prevent it from running.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Similarly, all apps that wish to be sold on the Apple App Store must go through Apple’s App Review. While not strictly a review for malware, security matters are considered in the process. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Per Apple</a>, “We review all apps and app updates submitted to the App Store in an effort to determine whether they are reliable, perform as expected, respect user privacy, and are free of objectionable content.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Further features:</strong> In addition to the above, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes technologies that prevent malware from doing more harm</a>, such as preventing damage to critical system files.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I need to purchase antivirus </strong><strong>for my Mac?</strong></h2>
<p>There are a couple reasons why Mac users may want to consider additional protection in addition to the antivirus protection that Mac provides out of the box:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apple’s antivirus may not recognize the latest threats.</strong> A component of strong antivirus protection is a current and comprehensive database of virus definitions. As noted above, , leaving Mac owners who solely rely on XProtect and other features susceptible to attack.</li>
<li><strong>Apple’s built-in security measures for Macs largely focus on viruses and malware alone.</strong> While protecting yourself from viruses and malware is of utmost importance (and always will be), the reality is that antivirus is not enough. Enjoying the life online today means knowing your privacy and identity are protected as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all, Macs are like any other connected device. They’re susceptible to threats and vulnerabilities as well. Looking more broadly, there’s the wider world of threats on the internet, such as phishing attacks, malicious links and downloads, prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, data breaches, identity theft, and so on. It’s for this reason Mac users may think about bolstering their defenses further with online protection software.</p>
<h2><strong> Further protecting your Mac from viruses and attacks</strong></h2>
<p>Staying safer online follows a simple recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being aware of the threats that are out there.</li>
<li>Understanding where your gaps in protection are.</li>
<li>Taking steps to protecting yourself from those threats and closing any gaps as they arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading between the lines, that recipe can take a bit of work. However, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comprehensive online protection</a> can take care of it for you. In particular, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/protection-score.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Total Protection includes an exclusive Protection Score</a>, which checks to see how safe you are online, identifies gaps, and then offers personalized guidance, and helping you know exactly how safe you are.</p>
<p>An important part of this score is privacy and security, which is backed by a VPN that turns on automatically when you’re on an unsecure network and personal information monitoring to help protect you from identity theft—good examples that illustrate how staying safe online requires more than just antivirus.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider your security options for your Mac</strong></h2>
<p>So, Macs can get viruses and are subject to threats just like any other computer. While Macs have strong protections built into them, they may not offer the full breadth of protection you want, particularly in terms of online identity theft and the ability to protect you from the latest malware threats. Consider the threats you want to keep clear of and then take a look at your options that’ll help keep you safe.</p>

Talk with your kids daily, and when you notice they may need additional help, be prepared to </span><a href="https://www.safekids.com/bullying-cyberbullying-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">find resources to help</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></li>

So much so that </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/260811/social-network-penetration-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">nearly 50% of the global population are social media users</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to some degree or other. With all that sharing, conversing, and information passing between family and friends, social media can be a distinct digital extension of ourselves—making it important to know how you can protect your social media accounts from hacks and attacks.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond the sheer number of people who’re on social media, there’s also the amount of time we spend on it.  </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">People worldwide spend an average of 145 minutes a day on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. With users in the U.S. spending just over two hours on social media a day and users in the Philippines spending nearly four hours a day, that figure can vary widely. Yet it’s safe to say that a good portion of our day features time scrolling and thumbing through our social media feeds.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given how much we enjoy and rely on social media, now’s a fine time to give your social media settings and habits a closer look so that you can get the most out of it with less fuss and worry. Whether you’re using Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or whatnot, here are several things you can do that can help keep you safe and secure out there:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Set strong, unique passwords</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Passwords mark square one in your protection, with strong and unique passwords across all your accounts forming primary line of defense. Yet with all the accounts we have floating around, juggling dozens of strong and unique passwords can feel like a task—thus the temptation to use (and re-use) simpler passwords. Hackers love this because one password can be the key to several accounts. Instead, try a password manager that can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Go private</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting, which can help protect your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be critical of the invitations you receive. Out-and-out strangers could be more than just a stranger, they could be a fake account designed to gather information on users for purposes of cybercrime, or they can be an account designed to spread false information. There are plenty of them too. In fact, in Q3 of 2021 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.8 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Reject such requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Think twice before checking in</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nothing says “there’s nobody at home right now” like that post of you on vacation or sharing your location while you’re out on the town. In effect, such posts announce your whereabouts to a broad audience of followers (even a global audience, if you’re not posting privately, as called out above). Consider sharing photos and stories of your adventures once you’ve returned. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. The internet is forever</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s a famous saying for a reason. Whether your profile is set to private or if you are using an app with “disappearing” messages and posts (like Snapchat), what you post can indeed be saved and shared again. It’s as simple as taking a screenshot. If you don’t want it out there, forever or otherwise, simply don’t post it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Watch out for phishing scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re increasingly accustomed to the warnings about phishing emails, yet phishing attacks happen plenty on social media. The same rules apply. Don’t follow any links you get from strangers by way of instant or direct messengers. And keep your personal information close. Don’t pass out your email, address, or other info as well. Even those so-called “quiz” posts and websites can be ruses designed to steal bits and pieces of personal info that can be used as the basis of an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Also keep an eye out for scams of all kinds</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sadly, social media can also be a place where people pull a fast one. Get-rich-quick schemes, romance cons, and all kinds of imposters can set up shop in ads, posts, and even direct messages—typically designed to separate you from your personal information, money, or both. This is an entire topic to itself, and you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/quizzes-and-other-identity-theft-schemes-to-avoid-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">learn plenty more about quizzes and other identity theft scams to avoid on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">8. Review your tags</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some platforms such as Facebook allow users to review posts that are tagged with their profile names. Check your account settings and give yourself the highest degree of control over how and where your tags are used by others. This will help keep you aware of where you’re being mentioned by others and in what way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">9. Protect yourself and your devices</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Security software can protect you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from clicking on malicious links while on social media while steering you clear of other threats like viruses, ransomware, and phishing attacks. It can look out for you as well, by protecting your privacy and monitoring your email, SSN, bank accounts, credit cards, and other personal information. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/id-theft-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With identity theft a rather commonplace occurrence today</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, security software is really a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">10. Check your Protection Score and see how safe you are</span></b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-134254" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/protec-score.png" alt="" width="203" height="177" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/protec-score.png 203w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/protec-score-148x129.png 148w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/protection-score.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Now you can point to a number that shows you just how safe you are with our Protection Score</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It’s an industry first, and it works by taking stock of your overall security and grading it on a scale of 0 to 1,000. From there, it calls out any weak spots and then walks you through the steps to shore it up with personalized guidance. This way, you’re always in the know about your security, privacy, and personal identity on social media and practically wherever else your travels take you online.</span></p>

<p>McAfee makes staying safe simple, and now this endorsement by an independent lab says we protect you best.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2021, AV-Comparatives subjected 17 different online protection products to a series of rigorous tests. Their labs investigated each product’s ability to protect against real-world Internet threats, such as thousands of emerging malicious programs and advanced targeted attacks, along with the ability to provide protection without slowing down the computer.</p>
<p>McAfee topped the field, taking home the award for AV-Comparatives’ Product of the Year thanks to our highest overall scores across the seven different testing periods throughout the year. McAfee further took a Gold Award for the Malware Protection Test, in addition to recognition for its clean, modern, and touch-friendly design and for the way that McAfee Firewall coordinates perfectly with Windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re honored by the recognition,” says Chief Technology Officer, Steve Grobman. “The strong reputation that AV-Comparatives carries in the industry cements our place as a leader in online protection.” He goes on to say, “Our work continues. The internet is evolving to be integral to every part of our lives. This creates new opportunities for cybercriminals and drives the evolution of the threat landscape. McAfee is committed to staying one step ahead of these sophisticated threats, ensuring customers can safely utilize the full value of our online world.”</p>

They’re feeling more exposed to online threats and want stronger protection.</p>
<p>Our 2022 Trends Study puts figures to these feelings, saying that they believe the risks to their online privacy have increased over the past year. Moreover, 42% believe the risks to their personal and financial information have increased as well.</p>
<p>These findings come as more consumers shift their daily lives online, with greater use of internet banking, more investment in virtual assets, and a proliferation of online activities due to COVID-19. A lot more sensitive personal information is being stored and shared on the web, which is putting increased pressure on passwords and security measures.</p>

<p>As more sensitive personal information is being stored and shared on the web, people are showing a strong preference for increased security overall. For example, when asked to choose between connecting with others from anywhere to always being fully protected, the response was overwhelming in favor of strong protection (63%) over ease of connection (16%). The same sentiment extended to the workplace, where “work meetings that are guaranteed seamless” trailed significantly at 14% versus “meetings that are guaranteed secure” at (62%).</p>
<p>Curious as to what steps you can take to be safer online? A few tools along with a few good habits can go a long way toward keeping your privacy and identity secure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Install and use online protection software:</strong> By protecting your devices, you protect what’s on them, like your personal information. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comprehensive online protection software can protect your identity in several ways</a>, like steering you clear of malicious downloads and links, protecting your email from phishing attacks, and providing you with a digital shredder that can permanently remove sensitive documents from your computer (simply deleting them won’t do that alone).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Use a VPN:</strong> <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A VPN is a Virtual Private Network</a>, a service that protects your data and privacy online. It creates an encrypted tunnel to keep you anonymous by masking your IP address while connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots. This is a great way to shield your information from crooks and snoops while you’re banking, shopping, or handling any kind of sensitive information online.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Improve your passwords and use multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> Strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, updated regularly, offer a strong line of defense against attackers. While this may require a bit of effort, a password manager can do the work for you by securely creating and storing strong, unique passwords for you. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comprehensive online protection software will include a password manager</a> as one of its many features. Additionally, MFA adds yet another layer of security by double-checking your identity beyond your username and password, usually with a text or email. If any of your accounts offer MFA, consider using it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Monitor your accounts:</strong> Give your statements a close look each time they come around. While many companies and institutions have fraud detection mechanisms in place, they don’t always catch every instance of fraud. Look out for strange purchases or charges and follow up with your bank or credit card company if you suspect fraud. Even the smallest charge could be a sign that something shady is afoot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Check your credit report:</strong> This is a powerful tool for spotting identity theft. And in many cases, it’s free to do so. In the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires the major credit agencies to provide you with a free credit check</a> at least once every 12 months. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-reports-score/order-credit-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada provides this service</a>, and <a href="https://moneyaware.co.uk/2017/05/how-to-get-your-credit-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the UK has options to receive free reports as well</a>, along with several other nations. It’s a great idea to check your credit report, even if you don’t suspect a problem.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Consider using identity protection:</strong> In addition to checking your own credit report, an identity protection service provides yet deeper monitoring of your personal information. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity protection such as ours monitors up to 60 different pieces of vital personal information and notifies you of potential misuse—up to ten months sooner than similar services</a>. In addition to this around-the-clock monitoring, it also provides up to $1 million in coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_DarkWeb-4.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_DarkWeb-4.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/300x200_DarkWeb-4-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>The internet has opened up wonderful new possibilities in our world, making life easier on many levels. You can pay your bills, schedule your next family vacation, and order groceries with the click of a button. While the internet offers many positive benefits, it also has some negatives. Although not entirely used for illicit purposes, the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-rise-of-the-dark-web-gig-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark web</a> is one part of the internet that can be used by criminals for illegal purposes, like selling stolen personal information.</p>
<p>But just what <em>is </em>the dark web? Basically, it’s a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by search engines. As an average internet user, you won’t come across the dark web since you need a special browser to access it. It’s certainly not something you need to stress about in your day-to-day browsing, and you shouldn’t let it scare you off the internet. Unless you actively seek it out, you&#8217;ll likely never have any contact with the dark web in your lifetime.</p>
<p>A better understanding of what the dark web is and the possible threats it contains can help you protect yourself, though. This guide provides the essential information you need, explaining the different levels of the web and revealing <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-safer-internet-for-you-your-family-and-others-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how you can stay safe</a>. With this knowledge, you can continue to browse online with confidence. Find out more below.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the dark web?</strong></h2>
<p>The &#8220;dark web&#8221; refers to websites that aren&#8217;t indexed by search engines like Google and Bing. This might seem strange since most people want their websites to be found through specific searches. Practices like search engine optimization (SEO) are specifically implemented to help websites perform well and rank higher in search engine results.</p>
<p>So, why would someone not want their website to be picked up by a search engine? The primary purpose is to preserve privacy and anonymity. The individuals and organizations on the dark web often engage in illegal activities and want to keep their identities hidden — something that is difficult to do with an indexed website.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the dark web should not be confused with the deep web, which is a part of the internet individuals access regularly. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they actually refer to different things. Deep web content — which isn’t picked up by search engines, either — includes pages that typically require additional credentials to access. Your online banking accounts and email accounts, for instance, are examples of deep web content.</p>
<h2><strong>Different levels of the web</strong></h2>
<p>The internet is home to billions of websites — an <a href="https://websitesetup.org/news/how-many-websites-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1.7 billion</a> to be exact, although that number changes every day as new sites are made and others are deleted. Your <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-sharing-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily </a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-sharing-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internet activity</a> likely falls within the publicly available and readily accessible portion of the internet (otherwise known as the surface web). However, there are additional &#8220;levels&#8221; of the internet beyond that top level. Read on to learn more.</p>
<h3><strong>Surface web</strong></h3>
<p>The internet you use to search for more information is referred to as the surface web or open web. This is the readily visible part of the internet anyone can access with an internet connection and a normal web browser like Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome. Other terms for the surface web include the visible web, lightnet, or indexed web.</p>
<p>Examples of content you&#8217;ll find on the surface web include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open media websites and news sites</strong> like those affiliated with blogs, newspapers, magazines, and other publications. An example would be the home page of a newspaper like The New York Times or a media company like BuzzFeed.</li>
<li><strong>Business websites </strong>for everything from major corporations to smaller local businesses. An example could be the website for a huge corporation like Bank of America or one for a smaller business like a local bakery.</li>
<li><strong>Mainstream social media platforms </strong>like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Although you likely use these tools via an app, they all have dedicated websites.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce sites </strong>used for buying goods and services, like Amazon, Walmart, Target, apparel retailers, and beyond. Any company that sells products online can be considered an e-commerce site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the sites you use daily — from your favorite news site to a local restaurant — are part of the surface web. What makes these websites part of the surface web is that they can be located via search queries and have recognizable endings like .com, .edu, .gov, or .org. You are able to find websites on the surface web because they are marked as “indexable,” meaning search engines can index and rank them. The sites are readily available on the search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the surface web only makes up <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/the-feeling-of-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 4%</a> of the total internet, meaning the internet is a lot more than what you see on the surface. Think of it as an ocean — there&#8217;s the top layer of water you can see and then there&#8217;s the vast world beneath. The remainder of the internet is what&#8217;s below the surface.</p>
<h3><strong>Deep web</strong></h3>
<p>The deep web refers to any page on the internet that isn&#8217;t indexed by search engines as described above. The deep web is the first level beneath the &#8220;surface&#8221; of the visible web — and it&#8217;s significantly larger than the surface web, accounting for an <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3249765/what-is-the-dark-web-how-to-access-it-and-what-youll-find.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 96% to 99%</a> of the entire internet.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that just because this type of content isn’t on the surface doesn&#8217;t mean it’s nefarious or has ill intent. A lot of the time, this content isn’t indexed because it includes pages that are meant to be hidden to protect consumer privacy, such as those that require login credentials.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of content on the deep web:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fee-based content </strong>like news articles that are behind a paywall or membership-only content requiring login credentials are considered part of the deep web. For example, if you pay to access members-only content in a content creator&#8217;s fan club, you are using fee-based content.</li>
<li><strong>Databases </strong>containing protected files that aren&#8217;t connected to other areas of the internet. These could be public or private files, like those from government entities or private educational institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Intranets </strong>for educational institutions, corporate enterprises, and governments are used for exchanging and organizing internal information. Some of it is sensitive and not meant for public dissemination. Intranets usually require a login and are part of the deep web.</li>
<li><strong>Secure storage platforms </strong>like Dropbox or Google Drive also require you to log in to upload and download files and photos. There are also proprietary data storage solutions used by companies that frequently handle sensitive data, such as law firms, financial institutions, and health care providers. An example might be a patient portal via a hospital or doctor&#8217;s office, where you can access your personal medical records.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, any webpage that requires a login is part of the deep web. That said, deep web content doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to fall into any of these categories. Any page that is non-indexable is technically also considered part of the deep web. It doesn&#8217;t have to require a login or contain sensitive data. Website creators and managers can mark pages as non-indexable if desired.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that sometimes a single organization&#8217;s website will include elements of both the surface web and the deep web. Take a college or university website, for example. Most schools have a comprehensive website providing information about the school&#8217;s history, campus location, student body, available programs of study, extracurricular activities, and more.</p>
<p>However, many schools also have an intranet — sometimes linked from the main university page — that&#8217;s accessible only for students or staff. This is where students might sign up for classes and access their school email, for example. Since this is sensitive information and requires a unique login, it doesn&#8217;t need to be made publicly available via search engines.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s better in the interest of privacy that these pages <em>aren&#8217;t </em>readily visible. It helps to protect the user&#8217;s data. From this example, you can see that the &#8220;deep web&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have to be scary, illicit, or illegal. It serves a legitimate and useful purpose. You shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of the deep web. It&#8217;s further important to distinguish the deep web from the dark web — as the next section explains.</p>
<h3><strong>Dark web</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned, the deep web and the dark web sometimes get confused. However, they are distinct. Technically, the dark web is a niche or subsection within the deep web. It consists of websites that aren&#8217;t indexable and can&#8217;t be readily found online via web search engines. However, the dark web is a carefully concealed portion of the deep web that people go out of their way to keep hidden.</p>
<p>What makes the dark web distinct from the broader deep web is the fact that dark web content can only be accessed via a special browser. The Tor network is often used to access the dark web.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dark web has a unique registry operator and uses security tools like encryption and firewalls, further making it inaccessible via traditional web browsers. Plus, the dark web relies on randomized network infrastructure, creating virtual traffic tunnels. All of these technical details serve to promote anonymity and protect dark web users&#8217; privacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Is it illegal to browse the dark web?</strong></h2>
<p>The short answer is no, it&#8217;s not illegal to browse the dark web. In fact, there are instances where individuals can use it for good. Whistleblowers, for instance, can find the anonymity available through the dark web valuable when working with the FBI or another law enforcement organization.</p>
<p>That said, while it&#8217;s not illegal to browse the dark web, it&#8217;s also not completely void of criminal activity. Putting yourself in close proximity with illegal activities is rarely a good idea and could heighten your risk of being targeted by a criminal yourself. It&#8217;s often best to leave that part of the deep web alone.</p>
<p>There are also many technological threats on the dark web. Malicious software, also known as malware, is a critical concern and can affect unsuspecting users. Even simply browsing the dark web out of curiosity can expose you to such threats, like phishing malware or keyloggers. While an endpoint security program can identify such threats if they end up on your computer, it’s ideal to avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>Further, if you try to buy something on the dark web — even if it&#8217;s not illegal — there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll be scammed. Dark web criminals use a variety of tricks to con people. For example, they may hold money in escrow but then shut down the e-commerce website and take off with the money. Due to the anonymous nature of the dark web, it&#8217;s very difficult for law enforcement to find such perpetrators.</p>
<h2><strong>How do criminals use the dark web?</strong></h2>
<p>Given its anonymous nature, the dark web clearly has an obvious appeal for cybercriminals. But just what do they use it for? The most obvious type of internet activity is the buying and selling of black market goods and services, from illegal drugs to illegal content. Cybercriminals may also run scams when selling such items, for example by taking a person&#8217;s money and not delivering the required product.</p>
<p>There are dark websites dedicated to the purchase and sale of illegal products or services (usually using untraceable cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial information</strong> like cloned credit cards with PIN, credit card details, online bank account logins, and more. People can then use these details to make legitimate purchases, negatively impacting your financial status and ruining your credit score in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Account details</strong> for <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/my-email-has-been-hacked-what-should-i-do-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked accounts</a> like email accounts, eBay accounts, social media accounts, streaming services, and more. For example, a person may buy a reputable eBay seller&#8217;s login details and then use their real account to make fake sales, pocketing the money and ruining the seller&#8217;s reputation in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Personal data</strong> that can be used to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/9-ways-to-determine-if-your-identity-has-been-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steal someone&#8217;s identity</a>, such as their name, address, Social Security number, and more. Identity theft is a serious problem that can negatively impact everything from your credit score to your private medical data.</li>
<li><strong>Illegal services </strong>like people claiming to be able to fix credit scores for a fee. Many of these “services” are scams. They may also be law enforcement masquerading as criminals in an attempt to catch people who are up to no good.</li>
<li><strong>Illegal goods</strong> like unregistered firearms and drugs. Law enforcement is increasingly cracking down on cybercriminals and the dark web.</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers like Tor, an open-source and free software, allow people to access dark websites where these goods are available, like a digital marketplace. These websites may look similar to any other surface or deep website you&#8217;d encounter. However, they differ in their domain suffix, ending in &#8220;.onion&#8221; instead of more obvious options like &#8220;.com&#8221; (Tor is actually short for The Onion Router, which is also where the term “onion routing” comes from — referring to anonymous communication on the dark web).</p>
<p>Onion sites often use scrambled names that make their URLs difficult to remember, minimizing the odds of being reported to authorities. It&#8217;s possible to search the dark web using specialized dark web search engines like Grams or link lists like The Hidden Wiki. However, these sources tend to be slow and unreliable, just like the dark web itself.</p>
<p>Some of this information can be extremely valuable on darknet forums. For example, while a Social Security number might go for $2, email credentials <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/why-your-social-security-number-isnt-as-valuable-as-your-login-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could sell for as much as</a> $120,000. Hackers can make a lot of money and do so with less worry that they might get caught. Thanks to the Tor browser&#8217;s layers of encryption and IP scrambling, it&#8217;s difficult to track people down on this part of the web.</p>
<h2><strong>How to protect yourself online</strong></h2>
<p>Again, although the dark web isn’t inherently bad, you should still be proactive in preventing your personal information from falling into the wrong hands. Here are a few ways you can help keep you and your family safe online:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protect your devices with passwords and antivirus software: </strong>One of the first lines of defense is to protect your devices. With passwords, ensure they’re unique and strong across accounts and keep them in one place, like a password manager. It’s also important to have antivirus software installed on your browsing devices to protect them from malware and other threats (you can even take this a step further by using a virtual private network or VPN).</li>
<li><strong>Think before oversharing on social:</strong> Social media keeps us connected with our family and friends, but before you click “share,” make sure you’re not revealing any personal information like your home address or something else that could be compromising.</li>
<li><strong>Sign up for a monitoring service:</strong> Whether it’s reviewing your credit report or an <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity protection plan</a> with 24/7 monitoring, additional trusted eyes on your accounts will help them stay protected.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Get a personalized protection plan today</strong></h2>
<p>The dark web might sound scary. The fact is, an everyday internet user like yourself likely won&#8217;t have any contact with this level of the internet. That said, it’s still important to take as many precautions as you can to keep your family and your technology safe.</p>

The internet is also useful for daily activities, like buying groceries or paying bills.</p>
<p>While it’s convenient to connect with people and complete tasks online, cybercriminals are eager to use the internet to steal financial or personal data for their personal gain — otherwise known as identity theft. This is a criminal act and can affect your credit score in a negative way and cost money to fix. It can also affect employment opportunities since some employers conduct a credit check on top of drug testing and a criminal history check. Identity theft victims may even experience an impact to their mental health as they work to resolve their case.</p>
<p>The good news is that being able to recognize the signs of identity theft means you can act quickly to intervene and minimize any effects in case it happens to you. You can also protect yourself by using preventive measures and engaging in smart online behavior. This article provides essential information about identity theft, giving you the tools you need to become an empowered internet user and live your best life online.</p>

<p>The internet is a great place to be, but identity thieves hope to catch you off-guard and seek access to your personal information for their benefit. This could include private details like your birth date, bank account information, Social Security number, home address, and more. With data like this, an individual can adopt your identity (or even create a fake identity using pieces of your personal profile) and apply for loans, credit cards, debit cards, and more.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be kept in the dark, though. There are several signs that your identity has been stolen, from a change in your credit score to receiving unfamiliar bills and debt collectors calling about unfamiliar new accounts. If you suspect that you’ve been affected by identity fraud, you can act fast to minimize what happens. Here’s what to do.</p>
<h3><strong>File a police report</strong></h3>
<p>Start by contacting law enforcement to file a report. Your local police department can issue a formal report, which you may need to get your bank or other financial institution to reverse fraudulent charges. An official report assures the bank that you have been affected by identity fraud and it’s not a scam.</p>
<p>Before going to the police, gather all the relevant information about what happened. This could include the dates and times of fraudulent activity and any account numbers affected. Bringing copies of your bank statements can be useful. Also, make note of any suspicious activity that could be related. For example, was your debit card recently lost or your email hacked? The police will want to know.</p>
<h3><strong>Notify the company where the fraud occurred</strong></h3>
<p>You should also notify any businesses linked to your identity theft case. Depending on the type of identity theft, this could include banks, credit card companies, medical offices, health insurers, e-commerce stores, and more. For example, if someone used your credit card to make purchases on Amazon, alert the retailer.</p>
<p>Medical identity theft is another good example. In this case, a fraudster may assume your identity to gain access to health care services, such as medical checkups, prescription drugs, or pricey medical devices like wheelchairs. If someone uses your health insurance to get prescription drugs from a pharmacy, for instance, make sure to alert the pharmacy and your insurer.</p>
<h3><strong>File a report with the Federal Trade Commission</strong></h3>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a government body that protects consumer interests. You can report identity theft via their portal, <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdentityTheft.gov</a>. They’ll then use the details you provide to create a free recovery plan you can use to address the effects of identity theft, like contacting the major credit bureaus or alerting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fraud department. You can report your case <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a> or by calling 1-877-438-4338.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask credit reporting agencies to issue a fraud alert</strong></h3>
<p>A common consequence of identity theft is a dip in the victim’s credit score. For example, a cybercriminal may take out new lines of credit in the victim’s name, accrue credit card debt, and then not pay the balance. For this reason, contacting the credit monitoring bureaus is one of the most important steps to take in identity theft cases.</p>
<p>There are three main agencies: TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. You can get a free credit report from each agency every 12 months via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. Check the report and note all fraudulent activity or false information and flag it with the relevant bureau’s fraud department. You should also initiate a fraud alert with each agency.</p>
<p>A fraud alert requires any creditors to verify your identity before opening a new line of credit. This adds an extra layer of security. An initial fraud alert lasts for 90 days. Once this expires, you can prolong your protection via an extended fraud alert, which will remain valid for seven years. You can notify one of the big three bureaus to set it up. They are then required to notify the other two bureaus.</p>
<p>A credit freeze is another smart move, which you can do through each of the three major credit bureaus. You can either call them or start the process online. This prevents people from accessing your credit report. Lenders, creditors, retailers, landlords, and others may want to see your credit as proof of financial stability. For example, if someone tries to open a phone contract under your name, the retailer may check the credit report. If there is a credit freeze in place, they won’t be able to view it and won’t issue the contract. If you need to allow someone access to your credit report, you can temporarily lift the freeze.</p>
<h3><strong>Change passwords to all of your accounts</strong></h3>
<p>Identity theft is often linked with leaked or hacked passwords. Even if you aren’t sure whether your passwords have been compromised, it’s best to play it safe. Change passwords to any affected accounts. Make sure to use strong passwords with a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols. Further, if there’s a chance to activate two-factor authentication on your accounts, this can provide added protection going forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Is it possible to prevent identity theft?</strong></h2>
<p>Ideally, you’ll never become the victim of identity theft, but things can happen. Cybercriminals work hard, but you can stay one step ahead by taking a few preventative measures. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn how to recognize common scams. </strong>ID theft comes in many forms, from email phishing scams to social media snooping, device hacking, and data breaches. Learn the signs of a scam. For example, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/?27phishing%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phishing emails</a> are often poorly written and frequently follow certain formats, like claiming that an account of yours has been suspended.</li>
<li><strong>Activate fraud alerts. </strong>Most financial institutions provide alerts about suspected fraudulent transactions, sending you a notification via phone call, text, or email if they notice suspicious activity on your account. The bank may also freeze an account automatically until any potentially unauthorized charges are clarified and confirmed by the account owner.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your devices with strong passwords.</strong> Your devices, including your phone, tablet, and laptop, should all be password-protected. In case one of your tech tools is stolen, it will be harder for fraudsters to gain access to your personal data. Set strong passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Make sure they don’t include information a person could figure out easily, like your home address or birthday.</li>
<li><strong>Use different passwords for different accounts.</strong> Any online accounts you use, from your banking app to your email, should be password-protected. Follow the same rules for setting strong passwords, but don’t duplicate passwords. If a hacker cracks the code for one account, they can easily guess their way into your other accounts. A password manager can help you stay on top of your passwords by encrypting them and storing them safely for easy tracking. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Identity Protection</a> includes a password manager that can secure your account credentials across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your documents. </strong>Protect hard copies of sensitive documents, like your Social Security card and birth certificate, by keeping them locked away. Also, dispose of documents with personal data by shredding them. This ensures that dumpster divers can’t access your information. Documents to shred might include invoices, bank statements, medical records, canceled checks, and junk mail with your name, phone number, and address.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t overshare on social media. </strong>Social media is a great way to connect with friends and family, but it can also be a goldmine for identity thieves. Avoid sharing details like your kids’ or pets’ names, which are often used in passwords. Sensitive information, like a home address or birthday, can also be used to build a fake identity. You may want to set your social media accounts to private in addition to limiting what you share.</li>
<li><strong>Review your credit report. </strong>You have the right to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months, which you can request via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. This provides you with a report from each of the three major credit bureaus. Review the report, verifying personal information, account details, and public records (like bankruptcies or liens) to ensure there isn’t anything suspicious.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the news. </strong>When major corporations are targeted by hackers, they’re <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required to alert affected consumers</a>. These breaches are also often reported in the media. To take a more proactive approach, though, check out the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/">McAfee blog</a>, which reports on breaches. If a business you use has been affected, change your passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can further protect yourself with antivirus software like McAfee’s <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total Protection plan</a>. This can help protect your devices against spyware and viruses. You can also enhance your network security with a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firewall</a> and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual private network</a> (VPN). A firewall controls traffic on your internet network based on predefined security parameters, while a VPN hides your IP address and other personal data.</p>

<p>And that’s just what’s been reported in the U.S. Far more crime goes unreported, and <a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/content/Javelin-2021-Identity-Fraud-Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is estimated that the cost of identity theft and fraud goes well into the billions of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Yet behind each stat is a person, a family, and a household that dealt with anything from a financial headache to a major life event no thanks to identity theft and fraud. Accordingly, we’re seeing to it that each and every person has the tools to prevent this from happening to them.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit about our approach. We looked at some of the key areas where people’s private information can be vulnerable and designed a tool that offers easy-to-use, intelligent protection for Windows, Android, and iOS devices, with a consistent feel on whichever device you’re using it.</p>
<h2><strong>Connect safely a VPN</strong></h2>
<p>Unsecured networks can leave us vulnerable, like when we use public Wi-Fi. What’s at issue is that a cybercriminal can potentially capture your login credentials and other personal information as you use a public network in a hotel, airport, coffee shop, library, and so forth.</p>
<p>So, we made sure to include a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to keep your information protected from prying eyes. It does this easily by detecting when you’re on a public network and automatically turning on on your VPN. The VPN then scrambles or encrypts, your data as it flows over the network. Unlike some VPNs that require advanced settings to shield your data, our app offers seamless security.</p>
<h2><strong>Dark Web Monitoring</strong></h2>
<p>Given that data breaches large and small continue to occur with more regularity than any of us would like, always-on monitoring of your private information is key.</p>
<p>Whether one of your personal accounts is hacked–or worse–another website somehow gets ahold of your data and subsequently gets breached, your data may end up on the dark web. This is where cybercriminals buy and sell information.</p>
<p>To detect these dangerous leaks, we included dark web monitoring, which alerts you if your log-in credentials have been exposed. It can even provide you with a link to the site that uses those credentials when the information is available. This allows you to swiftly reset your passwords, mitigating the risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Identity theft insurance and recovery support</strong></h2>
<p>Should the unfortunate happen to you, we have your back. In several ways.</p>
<p>Recovering from identity fraud or theft can be expensive. We’ll help relieve the burden with $1M coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more. If money was stolen directly from a bank account, we&#8217;ll also reimburse up to $10,000 stolen funds.</p>
<p>No question about it, recovery can be time-consuming, confusing, and even frustrating. With that, we offer licensed recovery experts who can work with you any time, around the clock, all year long. These pros can use a limited power of attorney to do the heavy lifting for identity recovery, taking all necessary steps to repair identity and credit.</p>
<p>In all, we protect your time and your money as part of protecting your identity too.</p>
<h2><strong>New: Identity Protection Score</strong></h2>
<p>Knowing your safe and staying that way just got far simpler. With a colorful view, you can see exactly what your Identity Protection Score is at a glance, which compiles your overall levels of security, privacy, and identity theft protection. Better yet, if it spots gaps in your protection, it guides you through straightforward fixes that can make you safer than before.</p>
<p>It’s an industry first, and something we all deserve—the ability to clearly see exactly how secure you are and to quickly shore up your protection whenever it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<h2><strong>Ease of Use</strong></h2>
<p>Also on our list, we wanted to make personal protection easy to use and available across all your compatible devices. So, whether you’re out with just your phone, or at home working at your PC, you have access to your protection, and can even pick up where you left off on a different device.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s about enjoying the internet</strong></h2>
<p>Ultimately, that’s what any of us want—to enjoy the internet with confidence, knowing that whatever it is we’re doing online is secure.</p>
<p>The way we use the internet continues to evolve. After all, it wasn’t long ago that the idea of using a phone to see who’s at the front door may have seemed a bit odd. Let alone having a little chat with the speaker on your kitchen counter. Yet that’s where we are today. And as the internet evolves, so will we. The protection we offer will cover your increasingly connected life in whatever shape that takes.</p>
<p>No question about it. We’re committed to protecting you, your privacy, identity, and certainly your devices too—and making all of it simple.</p>
<p>Here’s to a happy and secure year!</p>

<p>In February 2021, the company <a href="https://ti.dbappsecurity.com.cn/blog/index.php/2021/02/10/windows-kernel-zero-day-exploit-is-used-by-bitter-apt-in-targeted-attack/">Dbappsecurity</a> discovered a sample in the wild that exploited a zero-day vulnerability on Windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1732">CVE-2021-1732</a>, is a win32k window object type confusion leading to an OOB (out-of-bounds) write which can be used to create arbitrary memory read and write capabilities within the Windows kernel (local Elevation of Privilege (EoP)). Memory exploitation generally requires a read, write, and execute primitive to bypass modern exploit mitigations such as DEP, ASLR and CFG on hardened operating systems such as Windows 10. A <a href="https://threatpost.com/memory-corruption-mitigations-doing-their-job/124728/">data-only attack</a> requires only a read and write primitive as it does not seek to execute malicious code in memory, but rather manipulates data structures used by the operating system to its advantage (i.e., to achieve elevated privileges).</p>
<p>Kernel exploits are usually the most sophisticated attack as they interact directly with the Windows kernel. When such attacks are successful, they are critical because they provide high privileges to the attacker, which can be used to increase the impact of the overall exploit chain. In this case the exploit is a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) that targets 64-bit Windows 10 version 1909. The original sample discovered was compiled in May 2020 and reported to Microsoft in December 2020. While searching for additional findings we went through a <a href="https://github.com/KaLendsi/CVE-2021-1732-Exploit">public exploit published</a> in March of 2021 by a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/356149984">researcher</a>. Having this code publicly available may raise the potential for additional threat attackers. While we have not found clear evidence demonstrating malicious use of the proof-of-concept (POC), we did discover some variants being tested and uploaded to VirusTotal.</p>
<p>In this blog post, McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) performed a deep dive into the analysis of the vulnerability, to identify the primitives for detection and protection. The exploit is novel in its use of a new win32k arbitrary kernel memory read primitive using the GetMenuBarInfo API, which to the best of our knowledge had not been previously known publicly.</p>
<h2>CVE-2021-1732 Deep Dive</h2>
<p>Exploitation of CVE-2021-1732 can be divided into six stages with the end goal of escalating a process’ privileges to System. The following diagram shows the stages.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the details, we must give some background to win32k exploitation primitives which are used in the exploitation of CVE-2021-1732.</p>
<h2>Win32K Background</h2>
<p>Win32k is a Graphical (GUI) component of the Microsoft Windows Subsystem, most of which exists in the kernel for performance reasons. It is used for graphical print of the Windows OS desktop. However, due to the win32k architecture, the kernel component of win32k still needs to be able to make calls to user mode through user-mode callback functions to facilitate window creation and management.</p>
<p>Kernel user-mode callbacks have been well researched as far back as <a href="http://www.uninformed.org/?v=10&amp;a=2&amp;t=sumry">2008</a> and <a href="https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2010/09/kernel-exploitation-r0-to-r3-transitions-via-keusermodecallback/">2010</a>, with a very comprehensive analysis in <a href="http://mista.nu/research/mandt-win32k-paper.pdf">2011</a> by Mandt. A win32k kernel function such as xxxCreateWindowEx will make a callback function such as xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes through the user process PEB KernelCallbackTable.</p>
<p>When the user-mode callback has completed, NtCallbackReturn executes and passes the expected return parameter back to the kernel. Due to the stateless nature of these callbacks, many vulnerabilities have been discovered related to the locking mechanisms on the objects leading to use-after-free (UAF) exploitation.</p>
<p>Win32k has been one of the most exploited components in the Windows kernel accounting for <a href="http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon8/track-4-01-state-of-win32k-security-revisiting-insecure-design-vishal-chauhan">63% of vulnerabilities from 2010 to 2018</a>, due to its large attack surface of syscalls relative to ntdll syscalls. Win32k vulnerabilities are generally turned into data-only attacks using a read/write kernel primitive by using a desktop object known as a tagWND data structure.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to data-only attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovering a vulnerability.</li>
<li>Leveraging existing or new read/write primitives using specific OS APIs on object fields such as tagWND.cbWndExtra.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tagWND data structure has two fields which make it a prime target for reading/writing within kernel memory; tagWND.cbWndExtra and tagWND.ExtraBytes. When a window is created using CreateWindowEx, it is possible to request additional bytes of memory directly after the tagWND object in memory through the cbWndExtra field in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-wndclassexa">WNDCLASSEXA structure when registering the window class</a>.</p>
<p>The number of extra bytes is controlled by the cbWndExtra field, and the allocated additional memory address is located at the ExtraBytes field. The read/write primitive is created as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discover a vulnerability such as a UAF, which will allow you to write to a tagWND object in memory called WND0.</li>
<li>Allocate another tagWND object called WND1 near the previously corrupted WND0 in memory.</li>
<li>Overwrite WND0.cbWndExtra to a large value such as 0xFFFFFFF.</li>
<li>Call an API such as SetWindowLongPtr on WND0 which will write OOB to fields within WND1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Win32k kernel user-mode callbacks have been exploited many times by leveraging tagWND read/write capabilities within the Windows kernel for escalation of privileges such as <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/14/j/an-analysis-of-a-windows-kernel-mode-vulnerability-cve-2014-4113.html">CVE-2014-4113</a>, <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2015/07/08/exploiting-the-win32kxxxenablewndsbarrows-use-after-free-cve-2015-0057-bug-on-both-32-bit-and-64-bit/">CVE-2015-0057</a>, <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/ae/our-research/exploiting-ms15-061-use-after-free-windows-kernel-vulnerability/">MS15-061</a>, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/digging-windows-kernel-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2016-7255/">CVE-2016-7255</a> and <a href="https://blog.exodusintel.com/2019/05/17/windows-within-windows/">CVE-2019-0808</a>.</p>
<h2>Win32k Exploit Primitives</h2>
<p>Several primitives have been observed in the CVE-2021-1732 exploit used by the attackers; additionally, it is worth mentioning that some of them are new and not previously seen in the wild.</p>
<p>Prior to Windows RS4 it was trivial to leak tagWND kernel addresses using multiple techniques, <a href="https://blog.exodusintel.com/2019/05/17/windows-within-windows/">such as calling HMValidateHandle</a> to copy tagWND objects from the kernel to user desktop heap. The latest version of Windows 10 has been hardened against such trivial techniques.</p>
<p>However, using the spmenu kernel address leak technique and relative tagWND desktop heap offsets, once a vulnerability is discovered to overwrite a tagWND.cbWndExtra field, it is possible to achieve kernel read/write capabilities without leaking the actual tagWND kernel addresses. The spmenu technique in this exploit was used <a href="https://bromiumlabs.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/thoughts-on-the-recent-ntsetwindowlongptr-vulnerability/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-16/materials/eu-16-Liang-Attacking-Windows-By-Windows.pdf">here</a>, but we are not aware of the GetMenuBarInfo API ever being used before in a win32k exploit.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the primitives used in CVE-2021-1732.</p>

<h2>Existing Windows OS Mitigations</h2>
<p>Great work has been done to harden the security of win32k against EoP attacks with new and improved mitigations by the Microsoft OSR team, <a href="http://mista.nu/research/mandt-win32k-paper.pdf">Mandt</a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/11/breaking-chain.html">Google Project Zero</a>, <a href="https://improsec.com/tech-blog/hardening-windows-10-with-zero-day-exploit-mitigations-under-the-microscope">Schenk</a> and <a href="https://www.ragestorm.net/Win32k%20Smash%20the%20Ref.pdf">Dabah</a>.  These mitigations include:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018ams/materials/D1%20COMMSEC%20-%20Saif%20Elsherei%20and%20Ian%20Kronquist%20-%20The%20Life%20&amp;%20Death%20of%20Kernel%20Object%20Abuse.pdf">Type isolation</a> (all same type objects tagWND being used).</li>
<li>Win32k filtering (limited to Edge browser and not process wide but since this <a href="https://improsec.com/tech-blog/win32k-system-call-filtering-deep-dive">research</a> there have been many improvements on win32k API filtering capabilities such as the addition of _stub_UserSetWindowLong and _stub_UserSetWindowLongPtr _stub_UserGetMenuBarInfo in win32k.sys).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/vulndev/development-of-a-new-windows-10-kaslr-bypass-in-one-windbg-command/">Fragmenting kernel desktop heap and removal of kernel addresses in the user desktop heap</a> (can use relative offsets within user and desktop heaps described later in the blog).</li>
<li>Removal of data type symbols from win32k drivers (obfuscation rather than mitigation).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the context of a malicious process exploiting CVE-2021-1732, the above mitigations provide no protection. However, it does not impact Google Chrome as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJDlk-9xkh6_8M_awrczWCaUuyr0Zd2TKjNBCiPO_G4/edit#heading=h.xgjl2srtytjt">it disallows win32k calls</a> (Windows 8 and higher), or Microsoft Edge as it applies win32k filtering on the relevant APIs.</p>
<h2>Triggering the Vulnerability and Patch Analysis</h2>
<p>When a window is created using CreateWindowEx API, a tagWND object is created by the Windows operating system. This window, as explained above, can be created with a parameter to allocate extra memory using cbWndExtra.</p>
<p>During the windows creation process (CreateWindowEx API) a callback named xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes is triggered to allocate space in the user mode desktop heap for the tagWND.ExtraBytes (offset 0x128) per the tagWND.cbWndExtra (offset 0xc8) value size (see figure 3 and 4 below for WND1).</p>
<figure id="attachment_133666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133666" style="width: 954px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-133666 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1.png" alt="" width="954" height="312" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1.png 954w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1-300x98.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1-768x251.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1-205x67.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133666" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3 &#8211; WND1 Kernel tagWND – User mode copy located at offset 0x28</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_133669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133669" style="width: 978px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-133669 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4.png" alt="" width="978" height="94" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4.png 978w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-300x29.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-768x74.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-205x20.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133669" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4 &#8211; WND1 User Mode tagWND</figcaption></figure>
<p>The location of this memory is stored as a user mode memory pointer to the desktop heap and placed at tagWND.ExtraBytes. It is then possible to convert the normal window to a console window using NtUserConsoleControl which will convert that user mode pointer at tagWND.ExtraBytes to an offset value which points into the kernel desktop heap (see figure 5 below for WND0). It is this change in value at tagWND.ExtraBytes (window type confusion) that can be exploited for an OOB write during the xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes callback window.</p>

<p>Per figure 6 above the following steps are required to trigger the vulnerability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a pointer to the HMValidateHandle inline function within user32.dll.</li>
<li>Hook xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes within the PEB KernelCallBack table.</li>
<li>Create multiple windows (we will just use the first two WND0 and WND1 created), using the CreateWindowEx API, so that two windows are created in close memory proximity.</li>
<li>Call HMValidateHandle on WND0 and WND1 which will copy their objects from the kernel desktop heap to user desktop heap. At tagWND+0x8 an offset is stored into the desktop heap; this offset is the same for the user and kernel desktop heaps. The exploit uses these offset values to calculate the relative distance between WND0 and WND1 in the kernel desktop heap which is needed later for reading and writing OOB. Per table 1 below, by using these offsets there is no requirement to leak the actual WND0 and WND1 kernel addresses since read and writes can be done relative to the offsets (user and kernel desktop heaps have the same offsets).</li>

<p>5. WND0 is then converted to a console window by calling NtUserConsoleControl which converts WND0.ExtraBytes from a user desktop heap pointer to an offset within the kernel desktop heap. This is needed later so that WND0 can write OOB to WND1.</p>
<p>6. Create malicious window WND_Malicious using the CreateWindowEx API</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>During the window creation the callback xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes API is executed to request user mode to allocate memory for WND_Malicious.cbWndExtra and pass the user desktop heap pointer back to the kernel function win32kfull!xxxCreateWindowEx.</li>
<li>xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes has now been hooked and we do the following before returning to win32kfull!xxxCreateWindowEx:
<ul>
<li>Call NtUserConsoleControl to convert WND_Malicious to a console window so converting its WND_Malicious.cbWndExtra from a user desktop heap pointer to an offset within the kernel desktop heap.</li>
<li>Finally call NtCallbackReturn which completes the callback and returns a single value to xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes. Instead of passing the user desktop heap pointer as expected by xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes back to the kernel we pass the value at WND0+0x08 which is the kernel desktop heap offset to WND0 per figure 7 below. Now anytime we call SetWindowLongW on WND_Malicious we will be writing to WND0.</li>

<h2><strong>Patch Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>The vulnerability lies in the fact that win32kfull!xxxCreateWindowEx does not check whether the window type has changed between the time it initiates the xxxClientAllocWindowClassExtraBytes and gets the response from NtCallbackReturn.</p>
<p>When we call NtUserConsoleControl with WND_Malicious in the hook above, xxxConsoleControl checks if tagWND+0xE8 flag has been set to 0x800 to indicate a console window per figure  below. As WND_Malicious was created as a normal window, xxxConsoleControl allocates memory at an offset within the kernel desktop heap and then frees the user desktop heap pointer existing at WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes (0ffset 0x128). It then places the offset to this new allocation in the kernel heap at WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes (0ffset 0x128) and sets the tagWND+0xE8 flag to 0x800 to indicate it’s a console window.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133684" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.png" alt="" width="862" height="606" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.png 862w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-300x211.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-768x540.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-183x129.png 183w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></p>
<p>After returning from the callback when we issued NtCallbackReturn above, xxxCreateWindowEx does not check that the window type has changed and places the WND0+0x08 at WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes per figure 9 below. The RedirectFieldpExtraBytes checks the WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes initialized value but it is too late as WND0+0x08 has already been written to WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes (offset 0x128).</p>

<h2>tagWND OOB Write</h2>
<p>The vulnerability within the xxxCreateWindowEx API allowed the WND_Malicious.ExtraBytes field be to set to a value of WND0 offset within the kernel desktop heap. Now any time SetWindowLongW is called on WND_Malicious it will write to WND0. By supplying an offset of 0xc8, the function will overwrite the WND0.cbWndExtra field to a large value of 0XFFFFFFF per figures 13 and 14 below.</p>
<p>This means it can write beyond its tagWND structure and ExtraBytes in kernel memory to fields within WND1. In addition, WND0.ExtraBytes is also overwritten with the offset to itself so calls to SetWindowLongPtrA on WND0 will write to an offset in kernel desktop heap relative to the start of WND0.</p>

<h2>Kernel Address Leak</h2>
<p>Now that the WND0.cbWndExtra field has been set to a very large value (0xFFFFFFF), anytime SetWindowLongPtrA is called on WND0 it will write into the adjacent WND1 in kernel memory per figure 15 below. By writing to specific fields in WND1 we can create a kernel address memory leak as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a value of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-styles">0x400000000000000</a> to WND1 style field to temporarily change it to a child window per figures 15 and 16 below.</li>
<li>Calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowlongptra">SetWindowLongPtrA</a> API on WND0 with a value of -12 (GWLP_ID) now allows the spmenu field (type tagMENU) of WND1 to be overwritten with a fake spmenu data structure since we have changed it to be a child window per figure 15 and 17 below.</li>
<li>Per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowlongptra">SetWindowLongPtrA</a> API documentation, the return value will give us the original value at the offset overwritten, i.e., the spmenu data structure pointer which is a kernel memory address. So, we now have leaked a pointer to a spmenu (type tagMENU) data structure in kernel memory and replaced the pointer in WND1.spmenu with a fake spmenu data structure within user desktop heap per figure 17 below.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Kernel Arbitrary Write</h2>
<p>An arbitrary kernel write primitive can be easily achieved now by writing our destination address to WND1.ExtraBytes field by calling SetWindowLongPtrA on WND0 which will write OOB to WND1 relative to the offset we specify per figure 23 below</p>
<p>In this case the offset is 0x128 which is ExtraBytes. Then simply calling SetWindowLongPtrA on WND1 will write a specified value at the address placed in the WND1.ExtraBytes field. The arbitrary write is achieved because WND1 is a normal window (has not been converted to a console window like WND0 and WND_Malicious) and so will write to whatever address we place in WND1.ExtraBytes.</p>

<h2>Data Only Attack</h2>
<p>The arbitrary kernel read and write primitives can be combined to perform a data-only attack to overwrite a malicious process EPROCESS token with that of PID 4 which is System for an escalation of privilege (EoP).</p>
<p>The original spmenu kernel address leaked previously has a pointer to WND1 at offset 0x50 per figures 24 and 25 below. Through multiple arbitrary reads using the GetMenuBarInfo on our fake spmenu data structure with this WND1 kernel address we can eventually read the PID 4 System EPROCESS token.</p>

<p>The exploit then restores overwritten data structure values once the EoP is complete to prevent a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this report, we undertook a deep analysis of CVE-2021-1732 which is a Local Privilege Escalation on Windows 10. Windows kernel data-only attacks are difficult to defend against, as once a vulnerability is discovered they use legitimate and trusted code through specific APIs to manipulate data structures in kernel memory.</p>
<p>The win32k component has been hardened through great work by Microsoft against read/write primitives, but there are still opportunities for exploitation due to its large attack surface (syscalls and callbacks) and lack of win32k filtering on a process-wide basis. It would also be great to see a system wide win32k filtering policy capability within Windows 10.</p>
<p>Patching is always the best solution for vulnerabilities, but a strong defense strategy such as threat hunting is also required where patching may not be possible, and to detect variants of vulnerabilities/exploits being used by campaigns.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ok, we can hardly blame you for hearing about ANY vulnerabilities except for Log4Shell in the last 30 days.  However, if your organization is using this software, you probably should have followed the disclosure last month, lest your “/etc/passwd” files are now known to the whole internet. Beyond that, there are two interesting points you can ponder while swirling your eggnog in its glass (side-rant on the disgustingness of eggnog redacted). Given how easy it is to exploit, the mere fact of the vendor </span><a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/00e38ba555cfb120361c9623de3285d70c60172f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">fixing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> the bug via their public GitHub seems to have been enough to bring attention to it and get public working POCs for this vulnerability in less than 3 days following the fix. If you’re curious about how more mature open-source code bases deal with this risk, projects like Chromium rely on a separate bug tracking infrastructure that can restrict who can access the bug reports (that will spell out the security risks and test cases) combined with public commit messages with simple phrasing meant to avoid attracting the attention on the security commits. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another interesting tidbit, the root cause of this bug is the misuse of a Go API to sanitize paths as discussed in this Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TomNomNom/status/1468521389623808002?s=20"><span data-contrast="none">thre</span></a><span data-contrast="none">ad</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It turns out the </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">filepath.Clean </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">function used to sanitize the input processed by the vulnerable code</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">only removes excessive “../../” if the path is absolute. This is a common case of an API behaving as expected but leading to dangerous consequences. Do you know for sure the codebase of your organization is free of these problems? The impact of unpatched vulnerabilities here could be the accessing or leaking of extremely sensitive data.  </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">*pondering becomes frantic* </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Big Sig sounds like the nickname Freud’s mother gave him. This bug is no less compelling. Early this December, Google Project Zero </span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/this-shouldnt-have-happened.html"><span data-contrast="none">blogged</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> about a vulnerability they found in Mozilla’s Network Security Services (NSS) with a CVSS score of 9.8, according to NIST’s National vulnerability database </span><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43527" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. There is a heap overflow in the processing of certain signatures (DER-encoded DSA and RSA-PSS signatures). To put it simply, the NSS is a collection of cryptographic libraries that enable developers to use safer/heavily tested implementations of cryptographic primitives and standards (for encryption of communication, verification of the authenticity of data, and so on). The feature where the bug was found is responsible for the verification of signatures that prove the authenticity of data using various public cryptography schemes. This type of function is typically used to sign emails or documents to confirm their actual authors. Something really interesting about this bug is its relative simplicity but also its long existence; according to Project Zero’s blog, this bug was exploitable going all the back to 2012. The vulnerable code path just happened to fall between the cracks where various fuzzers used by Mozilla overlap.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you like your signatures to be verified, and rely on the NSS library to do so, you should definitely have a look at the advisory and use the latest version of the software (NSS version 3.73/3.681 ESR or later). Firefox </span><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-51/"><span data-contrast="none">seems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> unaffected, but other software that parses signatures might be impacted (Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution, Evince and more). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

There’s either a headline in your news feed or an email from a website or service you have an account with—there’s been a data breach. So what do you do when you find out that you and your information may have been caught up in a data breach? While it can feel like things are out of your hands, there are actually several things you can do to protect yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with a look at what kind of information may be at stake and why crooks value that information so much (it’s more reasons than you may think).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What can get exposed in a data breach? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The fact is that plenty of our information is out there on the internet, simply because we go about so much of our day online, whether that involves shopping, banking, getting results from our doctors, or simply hopping online to play a game once in a while. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Naturally, that means the data in any given breach will vary from service to service and platform to platform involved. Certainly, a gaming service will certainly have different information about you than your insurance company. Yet broadly speaking, there’s a broad range of information about you stored in various places, which could include: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As to what gets exposed and when you might find out about it, that can vary greatly as well. One industry research report found that </span><a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/how-to-minimize-your-mean-time-to-detect-a-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">60% of breaches were discovered in just days from the initial attack while others could take months or even longer to detect</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Needless to say, the timeline can get rather stretched before word reaches you, which is a good reason to change your passwords regularly should any of them get swept up in a breach. (An outdated password does a hacker no good—more on that in a bit.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What do crooks do with this kind of information?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The answer is plenty. In all, personal information like that listed above has a dollar value to it. In a way, your data and information are a kind of currency because they’re tied to everything from your bank accounts, investments, insurance payments—even tax returns and personal identification like driver’s licenses. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With this information in hand, a crook can commit several types of identity crime—ranging from fraud to theft. In the case of fraud, that could include running up a bill on one of your credits cards or draining one of your bank accounts. In the case of theft, that could see crooks impersonate you so they can open new accounts or services in your name. Beyond that, they may attempt to claim your tax refund or potentially get ID issued in your name as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another possibility is that a hacker will simply sell that information on the dark marketplace, perhaps in large clumps or as individual pieces of information that go for a few dollars each. However it gets sold, these dark-market practices allow other fraudsters and thieves to take advantage of your identity for financial or other gains. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

However, we’ve also seen hackers simply dump stolen information out there for practically anyone to see. The motivations behind them vary, yet could involve anything from damaging the reputation of an organization to </span><a href="https://www.dataleaklawyers.co.uk/blog/greenwich-university-suffers-second-data-breach-called-revenge-hack/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">cases of revenge</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In short, when it comes to data breaches, practically any business is a potential target because practically every business is online in some form or fashion. Even if it’s by way of a simple point-of-sale machine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When a business, service, or organization falls victim to a breach, it doesn’t always mean that you’re automatically a victim too. Your information may not have been caught up in it. However, it’s best to act as if it was. With that, we strongly suggest you take these immediate steps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you spot unusual or unfamiliar charges or transactions in your account, bank, or debit card statements, follow up immediately. That could indicate improper use.

And that’s who we’re looking out for—you and everyone who wants to enjoy life online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We believe it’s important that someone has your back like that, particularly where some of today’s hacks and attacks can leave people feeling a little uneasy from time to time. You’ve probably seen </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/data-breach-security-steps/"><span data-contrast="none">stories about data breaches at big companies</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> pop up in your news feed. Or perhaps you or someone you know had their debit or credit card number hacked. Problems like these are out there, unfortunate thorns in the side of the internet we’ve come to love. Yet while these issues persist, there’s plenty you can do to avoid them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s where we have your back—doing all we can to make life online enjoyable for everyone, with protection that helps people finally feel safe and stay that way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The reality is that nobody wants to deal with hackers, malware, and other attacks crop up on the internet. And while it’s important to be aware of those things, we’d rather that you didn’t have to worry about them. Protection should come easy. Whether it’s keeping your banking, shopping, and streaming secure, along with your privacy and personal info too, protection should feel simple and tailored to you. That’s what we strive for.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So as you think about protecting your life online, take a moment to consider what you’re protecting. As you do, you’ll see that it means far more than protecting your computers, phones, and other devices. Ultimately, it’s about protecting you, and all the important things connected to you. You can think of it in three ways …</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Protect what’s precious </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What’s among the top things people say they want to protect? Their photos. Not far behind photos are all manner of digital treasures that people like to keep close, which ranges anywhere from music they’ve downloaded to old voicemails of their children, nieces, and nephews that they’ve saved over the years. Without a doubt, we have plenty of things stored on our computers and phones that we simply couldn’t do without.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-132889" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-whats-precious.png" alt="" width="232" height="157" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-whats-precious.png 232w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-whats-precious-191x129.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />Protecting these things means protecting the devices you use to store and access them. Installing </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software like ours</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is the first step. In addition to award-winning antivirus software and firewall protection to help keep hackers at bay (and away from your photos and other precious files), it goes a step further. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our new Online Protection Score shows you just how safe you are and guides you through simple steps that can seal up gaps and improve your protection overall. In all, it’s a personalized and simple way to make sure you’re protected as possible and continually make improvements as they’re needed. It’s a way of getting expert protection without being an expert.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Protect what’s vital</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s also the “Important Stuff” in life, like our financial records, tax returns, and all the banking that we do on our phones and computers. And let’s throw shopping into mix because shopping’s important too! You can protect the important things like this, which can help hackers out of your business.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For starters, you can protect your important files three ways with our online protection by using a combination of the McAfee® File Lock and Shredder<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> features to manage your privacy: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee File Lock allows you to create password-protected encrypted drives on your PC that only appear when you’ve unlocked them, perfect for storing sensitive files like tax returns and financial documents. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">And when you’re looking to dispose of sensitive files, McAfee Shredder securely deletes files so that would-be thieves can’t put the pieces back together.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-132892" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vpn-prot.png" alt="" width="471" height="254" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vpn-prot.png 471w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vpn-prot-300x162.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vpn-prot-205x111.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" />You can lock down your privacy even further with a VPN that can shield you automatically from snooping attacks online, whether at home or when using public Wi-Fi. It creates an encrypted connection that works like a private tunnel that hides your IP address and the things you’re doing online from cybercrooks. It’s ideal for keeping your sensitive personal information like your financial data, passwords, and browsing history hidden from both hackers and websites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And here’s another big help. A password manager. You likely have dozens of passwords, plus a few more that you’ve probably forgotten about. You can protect your passwords and the accounts associated with them with a password manager that creates and securely stores a strong, unique password for each of your accounts. Plus, you can use it to update those passwords on the regular. Few things make it tougher for hackers than strong, unique passwords that get changed often. In a time of data breaches and account theft, a password manager is a great call.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Protect yourself (and your people)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While it’s important to focus on protecting things like laptops, phones, photos, files, and data, you’re ultimately protecting something far greater You. Your privacy, your personal information, your accounts, all the things that taken together make you—you. The thing is that our lives are more fluid and mobile than ever before. One moment we’re banking on our laptop, the next we’re splitting the cost of dinner with a payment on our phone. The constant here is you. You’re at the center of all this activity regardless of the device you’re using. The same goes for your family and the people you care about. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s why we protect people, not just their devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-132895" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-girl.png" alt="" width="197" height="243" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-girl.png 197w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/protect-girl-105x129.png 105w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" />McAfee Identity Protection Service monitors the dark web for your personal info such as emails and associated passwords, up to 60 different types of critical info. If we detect that your data was stolen, you’ll get immediate alerts on the devices of your choice and guidance on how to secure your info quickly and effectively. In all, you can keep tabs on your identity any time you’re connected to the internet, and if an issue crops up you can click, solve, and carry on. ​ ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Extended identity protection offers up the extra comfort of knowing that you have licensed recovery pros on the case if identity theft does happen to you. This includes monitoring and restoration services, along with identity theft insurance for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">While that’s just a few of the ways McAfee has your back, we hope it gives you a good sense of what online protection should do—how it should protect you and all the things connected to you. And on today’s internet, that’s quite a bit. There’s so much to experience online today, and we believe you should enjoy all of it, freely and with the confidence that comes from knowing you’re safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So there’s that subtle difference we mentioned. Identity fraud involves misuse of an existing account.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft took on new forms during the pandemic, such as was </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-boston-pandemics-michigan-3b6e779f6174590850c73cccee8d5d3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the case of a Rhode Island man charged with nearly half a million dollars in a pandemic unemployment fraud case</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Similarly, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/malden-man-sentenced-covid-relief-fraud-and-identity-theft" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a Massachusetts man was sentenced for filing fraudulent claims for relief funds, as well as open store credit accounts using fake identities</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Court proceedings alleged that the personal information used to commit this fraud came from several sources, including information stolen from a realty company that collected that information from potential renters. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft can stem from the workplace as well, such as </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/maryland-13fc01a9da4d1eb5c6afc2c7c2261354" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the sentencing of a Maryland man who used stolen lists of personal information from his former employer</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft can run far deeper than these examples. Because it effectively allows someone else to pose as you, an identity thief can do more than drain your accounts. They can also claim health insurance benefits, file taxes in your name, or possibly purchase the property. Further, an identity thief can potentially get a job, driver’s license, or other forms of ID in your name, which could ruin your credit history, reputation, or even create a police record in your name. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while both identity fraud and identity theft are certainly something you want to prevent, identity theft holds the potential to affect far-reaching aspects of your life—which marks a distinct difference between the two.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It usually starts with someone saying anything from, “That’s strange …” to “Oh, no!” There’ll be a strange charge on your credit card bill, a piece of mail from a bill collector, or a statement from an account you never opened—just to name a few things.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>Log4j/Log4shell is a remote code execution vulnerability (RCE) in Apache software allowing attackers unauthenticated access into the remote system. It is found in a heavily utilized java open-source logging framework known as log4j. The framework is widely used across millions of enterprise applications and therefore a lucrative target for threat actors to exploit. The availability of the POC exploit and ease of exploitation triggered the widespread exploitation attempts that we are now witnessing.</p>
<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-44228</a> – Apache Releases Log4j Version 2.15.0 to Address Critical RCE Vulnerability Under Exploitation.</p>
<p>Should the vulnerability be present, an attacker might run arbitrary code by forcing the application or server to log a specific string. This string can force the vulnerable system to download and run a malicious script from the attacker-controlled system, which would allow them to effectively take over the vulnerable application or server.</p>

<h2><strong>Attack Chain and Defensive Architecture</strong></h2>
<p>Organisations preparing to defend against this threat needs to think beyond the initial access vector. What the vulnerability allows a threat actor to do is initially only connect to a remote endpoint and establish a beachhead. The attacker only gets a return on investment when they can exploit that initial foothold either to move laterally, execute additional payloads on the endpoint or attack other organisations as part of a botnet. Instead of just focusing on the initial access vector, let’s look at the entire defensive kill chain.</p>

<p>The impact on organisations varies between resource takeover, denial of service or data theft. Therefore, making visibility in attack patterns and trend via threat intelligence extremely critical. In addition, other attack vectors have been discovered which allows for local exploitation of the log4j library over WebSocket.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the defense lifecycle in more details</p>
<h2><strong>Getting the Latest Threat Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Threat Intelligence is critical to adapt security controls and gain an understanding of attacker techniques and active campaigns exploiting the vulnerability</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MVISION Insights platform reports threat intelligence related to the Log4j attacks under the campaign name <em>Log4Shell &#8211; A Log4j Vulnerability &#8211; CVE-2021-44228</em>.</p>
<p>The Global Prevalence map snapshots captured on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> December 2021 demonstrates how impactful has being the vulnerability so far and how fast activity, both defender and attack, is increasing and spreading worldwide.</p>

<p>As we are writing this blog, on MVISION Insights there are 1,813 IOCs including MD5, SHA256, URL, IP, DOMAIN, HOSTNAME. In terms of Determinism, 1,632 are unique and 30 are commodity.</p>
<p>The top MD5 detected so far has been related to Kinsing (MD5: 648effa354b3cbaad87b45f48d59c616), a crypto miner with backdooring features. The file runs on Linux machines and has been uploaded on Virus Total for the first time in December 2020.  Its detection increased by 161% between the 11<sup>th</sup> and the 15<sup>th </sup>of December 2021 and it is currently observed in 19 different countries. The log4j vulnerability is helping threat actors to push Kinsing malware via encoded payloads to vulnerable services exposed to the internet. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We are actively monitoring for and analyzing new payloads.</p>

<p>The same unique indicator is also reported as part of other two threat campaign on MVISION Insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kinsing Malware Adds Windows to Its Target List</em></li>
<li><em>Misconfigured Apache Hadoop YARN Exploited</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Since April 2020, when the Kinsing crypto miner was discovered, further developments of the malware have occurred including a rootkit component and other features that make detection harder. Kinsing comes with multiple shell scripts that download and install the backdoor, miner, and rootkit alter the system itself.</p>
<p>The IP address 45.155.205[.]233 included within the MVISION Insights IOCs and used by threat actor as a <em>log4j</em> callback attack server has been detected 6,884 times by December 4<sup>th</sup> topping 15,106 detections by December 7<sup>th</sup>. Most detected countries included the United States, Turkey, Thailand, UK, Taiwan, and Italy.</p>
<p>MVISION Insights also includes indicators related to unique variants of MIRAI botnet that McAfee observed being leveraged by threat actors to exploit the <em>log4j</em> vulnerability.</p>
<p>Shell scripts are using <em>wget</em> and <em>curl</em> tools for external communication as part of the attack chains analyzed.</p>
<p>Latest updates highlighted Conti ransomware group actively leveraging the <em>Log4Shell</em> exploit to gain access to internal corporate resources and lunch their malicious payloads. But also, Khonsari group and state sponsored APT35 have been reported by researchers.</p>
<h2><strong>Determining your Asset Exposure</strong></h2>
<p>In this case, you should detect and prioritise internet facing applications running java-based web servers such as Apache Tomcat, either isolate or patch these resources. Run vulnerability scans for both monolithic and containerized workloads to build an inventory of assets that might be impacted.</p>
<h3><strong>MVISION Cloud </strong></h3>
<p>Continuously discovers your cloud resources and can run vulnerability scans for Virtual Machines and Containerized workloads in the cloud. MVISION Cloud has the ability to build an inventory of running processes within workloads as part of it application control capabilities. If log4j is used as a separate package we will detect the vulnerability in both runtime and container registry. If the log4j is included in the java binary we will not be able to scan it.</p>
<p>Ensure you run configuration audits for cloud assets that allow unrestricted outbound access and does not use firewalls or NAT GW’s for outbound connections. Run configuration audits for secondary misconfigurations that might allow the attacker to exploit IAM to elevate privileges, gain persistence or takeover other resources.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>MVISION Insights</strong></h3>
<p>Compares the available defensive capabilities on the endpoint to the attacker techniques, tools and IOC’s and highlights exposed endpoints.</p>

<h2><strong>Blocking Exploitation Attempts</strong></h2>
<p>The attacker only succeeds if they can get to this stage so blocking outbound suspicious connections, preventing execution of additional payloads, and protecting credentials/auth tokens theft are things that could prove to be critical in defeating the attack. As part of the available threat intelligence attackers are using several post exploit methodologies to pivot from the original log4j injection vulnerability. This varies from misuse of resources with crypto miners, deploying malware, or exfiltrating sensitive information.</p>
<h3><strong>MVISION Cloud – Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)</strong></h3>
<p>Use Application Control (VM and Containers) to kill unverified server processes and payloads from executing.</p>

<h3><strong>McAfee Endpoint Protection Platform</strong></h3>
<p>Use signature-based protection in ENS 10.7 to block known hashes of second stage malicious payloads. On December 12, 2021, McAfee Enterprise released<strong> V3 AMCore content 4648 (ENS)</strong> and <strong>V2 DAT 10196 (VSE)</strong>. Generic detections are provided under the title <strong>Exploit-CVE-2021-44228.C</strong>.</p>
<p>In ENS (Endpoint Security) 10.7 update 4 and above, there is a powerful security feature available to every defender, which is the ability to trigger a memory scan from an Expert Rule. For more details on this capability, please see this blog post from our AC3 team</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/log4j-and-the-memory-that-knew-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/log4j-and-the-memory-that-knew-too-much</a></p>
<p>Additionally, it is recommended to enable the ENS ATP rules that prevent or detect post exploitation techniques such of second stage payload execution, credential dumping or encryption activity from ransomware, use of malicious tools or lateral movement.</p>
<h3><strong>Network Security Platform</strong></h3>
<p>An Emergency User Defined Signature has been written and tested by McAfee Enterprise to provide immediate protection against the Apache Log4j2 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-Defined Signature:</strong> <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KB95088 – REGISTERED – NSP Emergent UDS Release Notes &#8211; UDS-HTTP: Apache Log4j2 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</a></li>
<li><strong>Attack ID:</strong> 0x4529f700</li>
<li><strong>Attack Protocol:</strong> HTTP</li>
<li><strong>Attack Direction:</strong> Client to Server</li>
<li><strong>To be included in the next regular sigset?</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Released date:</strong> December 10, 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on latest signatures, please follow the KB…<a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KB95091: McAfee Enterprise coverage for Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228 Remote Code Execution</a></p>
<h2><strong>Detecting and Hunting for Exploitation Activities</strong></h2>
<p>Assuming breach is critical especially if you know that you had exposed assets and therefore, build forensics and post exploitation detection techniques this includes exploitation of living of the land binaries (LOLBINS), credential dumping as well as using information such as known file hashes / hunting queries to query web server / reverse proxy/ Network IPS logs.</p>
<h3><strong>MVISION Insights</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to an Intelligence Summary, Insights provides exportable YARA rules to find additional Indicators of Compromise.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133468" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM.png" alt="" width="1376" height="676" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM.png 1376w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM-300x147.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM-1024x503.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM-768x377.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-9.59.29-AM-205x101.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1376px) 100vw, 1376px" /></p>
<h3><strong>MVISION EDR</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, you can leverage Real Time and Historical Search functionality to proactively identify vulnerable systems or post exploit activity such as…</p>
<ul>
<li>historical process execution spawning from Java as this could be a clear indicator that the parent java process was used to spawn additional malicious processes.</li>
<li>monitoring for detection of threats emanating from assets running Java</li>
<li>identify outbound communication attempts to known C2 domains through DNS or Web traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify Indicators of Compromise associated with exploit payloads</p>
<h2><strong>Data Exfiltration Visibility and Control with Cloud Security</strong></h2>
<p>Along with control on the endpoint, visibility into attacks and where data is being uploaded is also critical to stopping Data Exfiltration. Mapping threats to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework will provide visibility into ongoing attacks happening in the cloud and where security controls can be improved to stop future attacks.</p>
<p>Another critical method to stopping the exfiltration of data is putting restrictions against data uploads to non-sanctioned cloud storage. Limiting data uploads to only sanctioned Cloud Service Providers can stop external and insider threats from transferring data to Cloud Services that are questionable or not sanctioned. The Cloud Registry within MVISION Cloud/Unified Cloud Edge will provide ratings for well over 25,000 Cloud Service Providers so restrictions can be placed on CSPs with high risks or attributes that put company data at risk.</p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Avoid technical jargon.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Jargon excludes and when you use insider language with a non-technical person, it can get overwhelming. Slow down. Use ordinary terms. For instance, instead of the hyperlink, consider “link.” Instead of URL, opt for “website address.” Rather than DM/PM, use “Private Message.” Note: Avoiding jargon doesn’t mean you dumb down to a person; it means using plain language to explain the same concept.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Be patient.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s a myth (and an unfortunate stereotype) that older adults don’t have the ability or don’t want to learn about technology. Frankly, they can, and they do. However, physical and mental changes are part of the aging process, which means repetition and patience are part of the process. Consider creating easy-to-read cheat sheets to summarize the day’s lesson. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Technology is impacting our lives in myriad ways, and no one feels this reality pressing in more than older adults. If you find yourself in the privileged position of coaching an older adult toward digital confidence, remind them of the gains ahead and that the gap from “here” to “there” isn’t nearly as large as they’ve imagined. Whenever possible, point their sights to the proven benefits of stepping off the sidelines and into a connected world. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

However, cybercriminals want us to get a bit too comfortable so they can take our personal or financial data and use it for their benefit. This is called identity theft, and it can cost people money and may dip their credit score.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can help minimize what happens by knowing the signs of identity theft and taking fast action when you recognize them. Find out how below.</p>
<h2><strong>How does identity theft happen?</strong></h2>
<p>Being online comes with many benefits, but it can also come with some risks. Identity theft usually begins with the criminal accessing sensitive personal data, such as Social Security numbers, birthdates, home addresses, bank account information, and driver’s license details. The fraudster can then take this information to fake your identity, using it to take out credit cards, apply for loans, and more.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at some ways identity thieves can get their hands on your valuable data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing scams: </strong><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/?hilite=%27phishing%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phishing </a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/?hilite=%27phishing%27">scams</a> can come in the form of mail, email, or websites. They may involve an identity thief pretending to be an entity you trust, like your own bank or insurance provider, to extract personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Data breaches</strong><strong>: </strong>Many companies store your data, from your health care provider to your internet service provider. For example, you may save payment details for your favorite shopping site. If hackers target those companies in a data breach, they can leak or access your sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Social media</strong><strong> snooping: </strong>Criminals may look to your social media to get information, like your birthdate and home address. Even seemingly innocent details, like the names of your children or pets, can be of interest to an identity thief. Why? People often use these details in their passwords.</li>
<li><strong>Hacking devices: </strong>Hackers may try to infiltrate your computer, tablet, or mobile device through viruses or malware. That’s where antivirus software can help. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee’s Total Protection service</a> works for you by protecting your devices and personal information from criminals.</li>
<li><strong>Simple theft: </strong>Not all identity thieves use advanced methods to get your information. In fact, a person can steal your phone and access any personal data you have on it if they can unlock it. Since many people save passwords to sensitive accounts on their devices, they are easy to hack.</li>
<li><strong>Dumpster diving: </strong>This is another example of a less tech-savvy approach to identity theft. If you throw away documents with sensitive data, thieves may get the information they want from your garbage. For example, bank account statements contain your account numbers, while pay stubs may include Social Security numbers. You should always shred paperwork before tossing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways thieves can get their hands on your data. Luckily, there are ways you can protect yourself against these methods. For example, you can protect your computer, tablet, or mobile device against hackers by equipping it with a strong password and safeguarding against phishing by <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding a firewall</a> and utilizing a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual private network</a> (VPN) like those offered by McAfee.</p>
<h2><strong>9 warning signs your identity has been stolen</strong></h2>
<p>With some best practices, you can protect your data and help safeguard you and your family against identity theft. One way to continue living your best life online is to watch for potential warning signs of identity theft. This ensures you can take fast action and minimize the effects if you’re targeted. Here are some essential signs to look out for.</p>
<h3><strong>You’re alerted to a credit card charge you didn’t make</strong></h3>
<p>Financial identity theft is one of the most common types of identity theft, and credit cards are a popular target. The rise in online shopping has made credit card fraud even more common.</p>
<p>Your online banking portal or app should allow you to set up alerts to email, call, or text you about suspected fraudulent credit card charges. If you get an alert, someone may have taken your identity.</p>
<h3><strong>Your loan or credit card application was denied</strong></h3>
<p>If you apply for a loan or line of credit and your application is denied, dig deeper. A rejection could indicate that your credit score is lower than you thought, possibly due to fraudulent activity. For example, someone may use your information to get new credit cards and not pay them off, leaving you responsible.</p>
<h3><strong>There’s a change to your credit score</strong></h3>
<p>Changes in your credit score can indicate identity theft. For example, if someone takes out utility bills in your name and doesn’t pay them, your credit score may dip. Checking your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) can help pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/get-my-free-credit-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) allows U.S. consumers to get a free credit report every 12 months. Just visit <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> to get a copy of yours from the credit reporting agencies. You can also pay for credit monitoring services to track your score.</p>
<h3><strong>There’s</strong> <strong>a new account you didn’t open under your name</strong></h3>
<p>Once identity thieves obtain enough data, including your name and address, they might be able to open new accounts and credit cards. When you check your credit report, keep an eye out for new accounts that you didn’t open. Another red flag is if you start getting bank statements or bills addressed to you for accounts you don’t recognize.</p>
<h3><strong>Your information was part of a data breach</strong></h3>
<p>Companies are required to <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notify customers of </a><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx">data breaches</a> that could impact them. For example, if you save your payment information and home address on a music streaming provider’s website and their database is hacked, identity thieves may get your data. Keep an eye out for notifications and read the news. The <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee blog</a> is another great resource for information on data breaches.</p>
<h3><strong>Debt collectors</strong><strong> call about accounts you never opened</strong></h3>
<p>If debt collectors start calling, be cautious, especially if they’re referring to accounts you aren’t familiar with. Don’t provide personal information to any collection agencies that call, as this can be a potential phishing scam. However, it’s a good idea to follow up on these cases by checking your credit report for new accounts. You could be liable if someone opened accounts under your name and didn’t pay them.</p>
<h3><strong>You receive bills for medical services you never used</strong></h3>
<p>Medical theft occurs when a fraudster imitates another person to get health care or supplies. For example, a person might use your identity to get prescription medication at a pharmacy. If you get unfamiliar medical bills, follow up. Incorrect medical records could impact your insurance premiums or interfere with your ability to get the care you need in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Mail is addressed to your home but with another person’s name</strong></h3>
<p>This could be an indicator of synthetic identity theft. This occurs when a fraudster creates a fake identity using various people’s real information. For example, they may use your address and Social Security number and another person’s photo to create a fake persona that’s creditworthy. They can then take out credit cards in that fake person’s name.</p>
<h3><strong>A tax return is filed under your name without your knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>If you receive a confirmation of an annual tax filing before you’ve filed, take note. Criminals may try to file a tax return for another person to access their tax refund. Alternatively, you may find that you’re unable to e-file your taxes, which can occur if someone else has already filed under your name.</p>
<h2><strong>What to do if you think your identity has been stolen</strong></h2>
<p>No one wants their identity stolen, but it’s still good to be prepared if it does happen. If you notice the above red flags, here are some steps you may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change passwords and login details for any affected accounts. </strong>If you use the same password for other accounts, change those too. The good news is that McAfee’s identity protection services come with a password manager, so you don’t have to worry about remembering your credentials across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze accounts</strong> with banks or credit card companies that show any suspicious activity, including debit and credit card Most financial institutions have a dedicated fraud department to help.</li>
<li><strong>Review your credit reports </strong>if you haven’t already and report any suspected fraud to the respective credit bureau.</li>
<li><strong>Contact local law enforcement </strong>to file a police report for lost or stolen credit cards, driver’s licenses, and more. Also, report your lost license to the DMV.</li>
<li><strong>Alert the </strong><a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRS</strong></a> <a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>fraud alert</strong></a><a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> department</strong></a> in case of tax-related fraud.</li>
<li><strong>Report Social Security-related fraudulent activity</strong> to the relevant government agency, the Social Security Administration’s <a href="https://oig.ssa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the Inspector General</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Place a freeze on your credit report.</strong> This blocks access to it to extend credit, ensuring no one can take out new lines of credit in your name.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to visit <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IdentityTheft.gov</strong></a> to report identity theft and find resources to help guide your recovery plan.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">What do crooks do with that data? Several things. Apart from using it themselves, they may sell that data to other criminals. Either way, this can lead to illicit use of credit and debit cards, draining of bank accounts, claiming tax refunds or medical expenses in the names of the victims, or, in extreme cases, assuming the identity of others altogether. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, data is a kind of currency in of itself because it has the potential to unlock several aspects of victim’s life, each with its own monetary value. It’s no wonder that big breaches like these have made the news over the years, with some of the notables including:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Facebook – 2019:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Two sets of data exposed the records of more than 530 million users, including phone numbers, account names, and Facebook IDs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Marriott International (Starwood) – 2018:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Half a million guests had names, email and physical mailing addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, Starwood Preferred Guest account information, dates of birth, and other information about their stays exposed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Equifax – 2017:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Some 147 million records that included names, addresses, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, and Social Security Numbers were exposed, along with a relatively small subset of 200,000 victims having their credit card information exposed as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned, these are big breaches with big companies that we likely more than recognize. Yet smaller and mid-sized businesses are targets as well, </span><a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/10-small-business-cyber-security-statistics-that-you-should-know-and-how-to-improve-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">with some 43% of data breaches involving companies of that size</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Likewise, </span><a href="https://upserve.com/restaurant-insider/pos-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">restaurants and retailers have seen their Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals compromised</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, right on down to neighborhood restaurants.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When a company experiences a data breach, customers need to realize that this could impact their online safety. If your favorite coffee shop’s customer database gets leaked, there’s a chance that your personal or financial information was exposed. However, this doesn’t mean that your online safety is doomed. If you think you were affected by a breach, there are multiple steps you can take to help protect yourself from the potential side effects. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Keep an eye on your bank and credit card accounts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the most effective ways to determine whether someone is fraudulently using one or more of your accounts is to check your statements. If you see any charges that you did not make, report them to your bank or credit card company immediately. They have processes in place to handle fraud. While you’re with them, see if they offer alerts for strange purchases, transactions, or withdrawals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. If you’re a victim, report it to local authorities and to the FTC for assistance. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">File a police report and a </span><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This will help in case someone uses your Social Security number to commit fraud, since it will provide a legal record of the theft. The FTC can also assist by guiding you through the identity theft recovery process as well. Their site offers a step-by-step recovery plan that you can follow and track your progress as you go.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Place a fraud alert</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you suspect that your data might have been compromised, place a fraud alert on your credit. This not only ensures that any new or recent requests undergo scrutiny, but also allows you to have extra copies of your credit report so you can check for suspicious activity. You can place one fraud alert with any of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and they will notify the other two. A fraud alert typically lasts for a year, although there are options for extending it as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Look into freezing your credit if needed</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Freezing your credit will make it highly difficult for criminals to take out loans or open new accounts in your name, as a freeze halts all requests to pull your credit—even legitimate ones. In this way, it’s a far stronger measure than placing a fraud alert. Note that if you plan to take out a loan, open a new credit card, or other activity that will prompt a credit report, you’ll need to take extra steps to see that through while the freeze is in place. (The organization you’re working with can assist with the specifics.) Unlike the fraud alert, you’ll need to contact each major credit reporting agency to put one in place. Also, a freeze lasts as long as you have it in place. You’ll have to remove it yourself, again with each agency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Update your passwords</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique. Many people utilize the same password or variations of it across all their accounts. Therefore, be sure to diversify your passcodes to ensure hackers cannot obtain access to all your accounts at once, should one password be compromised. You can also employ a password manager to keep track of your credentials, such as one </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you’ll find in comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Consider using identity theft protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A solution such as this will help you to monitor your accounts and alert you of any suspicious activity. Specifically,</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">our own Identity Protection Service will monitor several types of personally identifiable information, alert you of potentially stolen personal info, and offer guided help to neutralize the threat</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Also, it can help you steer clear of some types of theft with preventative guidance that can help keep theft from happening in the first place. With this set up on your computers and smartphone you can stay in the know and address issues immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Use online protection software, and expand your security toolbox</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To use your credit card safely online to make purchases, add both a VPN and password manager into your toolbox of security solutions. A VPN keeps your shopping experience private, while a password manager helps you keep track of and protect all your online accounts. Again, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you’ll find a VPN as part of comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

But these many benefits might also leave us exposed to risks, like identity theft.</p>
<p>Identity theft is characterized by one person using another’s personal or financial data for their benefit. Cybercriminals may take information like a person’s name, birthday, Social Security number, driver’s license number, home address, and bank account information and use it for their benefit. A name and matching financial information, for instance, can be used to apply for credit cards or open new accounts.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can safeguard yourself and your family with some best practices — allowing you to enjoy your best life online and worry less about cybercriminals. Share these 10 tips with your family to help keep your entire household safe.</p>
<h2><strong>Password-protect your devices with strong passwords</strong></h2>
<p>A good habit to get into is to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/5-ways-to-protect-your-online-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">password-protect</a> your computer, tablet, and mobile devices through unique, strong passwords. These devices are home to some of your most sensitive information, including everything from emails to apps that connect to your bank accounts. So, if these devices fall into the wrong hands, a password makes it harder to access your personal data.</p>
<p>Take some time to come up with your passwords, though. It’s important to create strong passwords that hackers can’t guess. A strong password will include a mix of symbols, numbers, and letters. Steer clear of simple passwords like “123456” (it might seem obvious, but this is one of the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-are-you-still-using-qwerty-2021s-most-common-passwords-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most common passwords people use</a>). Also, avoid including information that other people can guess, like your birthdate, home address, or name.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to use different passwords for different accounts. If you use the same password across multiple accounts, and a fraudster gains access to one account, they may access the others. Fortunately, McAfee’s identity protection services include a password manager, which can help secure your account credentials across multiple devices. This tool encrypts passwords, storing them safely and making it easy to keep track of them.</p>
<h2><strong>Learn how to identify and avoid phishing scams</strong></h2>
<p>Identity thieves are skilled at leveraging new technologies. Phishing is one great example of this. Phishing involves criminals masquerading as trustworthy entities, such as government agencies or banks, and using this trusted position to get sensitive information. Phishing scams started with traditional mail. They’re now also done via phone, text, and email.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, never give out any personal information when contacted by a business, bank, or another entity. Also, make sure your email spam filters detect phishing attempts. Never open emails from people you don’t know, and don’t download email attachments without knowing what they are. Some <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phishing</a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> emails</a> include malware, which can infiltrate your device and access personal data. A <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Total Protection plan</a> is an all-in-one protection solution that can help you detect and avoid malware.</p>
<p>Fraudulent websites may also use phishing techniques. A website may look similar to the legitimate website of a mortgage lender, bank, or credit card company but might be a fraudulent platform seeking to get information from consumers. Always verify that any website you visit is the legitimate website of the institution, and consider <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee </a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antivirus</a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software</a>, which offers a safe browsing solution.</p>
<h2><strong>Set up alerts through your bank</strong></h2>
<p>When financial identity theft occurs, this can also impact financial institutions like banks and lenders. So, they’re eager to prevent fraud, as well. One way they do this is through fraud alerts. You can set up your online banking to issue fraud alerts — for example, via an email, text message, or phone call — if your bank suspects suspicious activity on your account.</p>
<p>In some cases, a bank will also freeze your account until you verify whether the activity is legitimate. This is a common tactic used to protect against credit card fraud. Geo-control is one example: If you live in the U.S., but a German IP address uses your credit card, your credit card provider will likely issue an alert. You can also set up alerts for certain transaction amounts or types.</p>
<h2><strong>Review your credit report regularly</strong></h2>
<p>Your credit report is one of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal for catching identity thieves and stopping them in their tracks. You’re entitled to a free credit report every 12 months via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>, an initiative of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/get-my-free-credit-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC). You can get a free copy of your report from each major credit bureau: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.</p>
<p>Review your report thoroughly, checking for inaccuracies. When credit monitoring, check your:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal information: </strong>Verify that your name, address, phone number, birthdate, Social Security number, and employment details are correct.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts: </strong>Confirm that all accounts listed are yours and current. Keep an eye out for unrecognized credit cards, utility accounts, phone accounts, or streaming accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Public records: </strong>Check for foreclosures, civil suits, liens, or bankruptcies. If these issues are on your credit report and you don’t recognize them, you might be affected by identity fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>If you find any discrepancies, contact the appropriate credit reporting company. You should also contact the relevant financial institution and visit <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/">IdentityTheft</a><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/">.</a><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/">gov</a>. You can report the suspected identity theft and find resources to help you recover.</p>
<h2><strong>Be mindful of what you share on social media</strong></h2>
<p>Social media is great for connecting with others online, but it does open the door to some vulnerabilities. Be careful about what you post, and steer clear of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/7-common-digital-behaviors-that-put-your-familys-privacy-at-risk/">sharing personal details</a> like your home address, children’s names, pet’s names, or birthdays, which some people use as passwords. If a social media platform offers two-factor authentication, opt in.</p>
<p>Images are another touchy subject. Never post photos that include private data, like a picture of your passport or vaccine card. Consider what’s in the background of any photos — from your home (with a house number) to mail with your address. Finally, you may want to set your visibility to private on all social media accounts, limiting who can view them. And even if your account is private, you should still follow the above tips.</p>
<h2><strong>Shred sensitive documents</strong></h2>
<p>Some identity thieves get people’s personal information by dumpster diving. One solution? Invest in a paper shredder. You’ll be able to shred documents into tiny bits that are hard to piece together, making it that much harder for someone else to piece together any personal information they contain.</p>
<p>Here are some documents worth shredding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debit card</strong><strong> statements, credit card statements, and bank statements </strong>that contain personal financial information</li>
<li><strong>Invoices or receipts</strong> containing details like financial account numbers</li>
<li><strong>Documents containing your Social Security number</strong>, like pay stubs and work contracts</li>
<li><strong>Junk mail</strong> with contact information, like your name and address</li>
<li><strong>Old photos and IDs</strong>, which people can use to create fake IDs</li>
<li><strong>Shipping labels</strong>, like those you might get from online retailers to make returns</li>
<li><strong>Medical records or receipts</strong>, which may contain insurance information</li>
<li><strong>Canceled checks </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure whether something needs to be shredded, go ahead and destroy it. It only takes seconds, and you’re better off safe than sorry.</p>
<h2><strong>Protect all of your devices with antivirus software</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you use a computer, tablet, or mobile device for many of your online activities, like paying bills, these devices contain a lot of personal data. So, it’s good to protect them from hackers. ​​Install <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/less-is-more-why-one-antivirus-software-is-all-you-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antivirus</a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/less-is-more-why-one-antivirus-software-is-all-you-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software</a> like McAfee’s to protect against viruses and spyware. It would be best if you also <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had a </a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firewall</a>, which is a network security system that controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on set security parameters.</p>
<p>To take your device security a step further, you may also want to invest in a virtual private network (VPN). This helps hide your online activity. It can safeguard against hackers on public networks but is also worth using at home. It hides details like browsing activity, personal data, and IP address from potential snoops. McAfee also offers <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPN</a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> services</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep personal documents in a safe space</strong></h2>
<p>While your computer, tablet, or mobile device may hold a great deal of personal data, you likely also have hard copies of sensitive documents worth protecting. Documents like your birth certificate, Social Security card, and passport contain valuable information that identity thieves can use for personal gain, so you want to make sure they’re kept in a safe space.</p>
<p>Don’t simply shove these documents into your desk drawer. It’s best to keep them in a locked, fireproof home safe with a secure code. To keep things organized, put each document in a protective plastic sleeve and put the sleeves in a binder. This can be useful if you have a large family and need to keep track of everyone’s data.</p>
<h2><strong>Follow the news to learn about data breaches</strong></h2>
<p>Sophisticated hackers don’t just target individuals. They may also try to infiltrate businesses, government agencies, higher education institutions, health care facilities, and any other organization that gathers sensitive consumer information. If an entity is subject to a data breach, they’re <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legally required to notify</a> any consumers who may have been impacted.</p>
<p>However, it’s still good to inform yourself about potential breaches that may affect you. Larger-scale data security risks are usually reported in the media. We also post about data breaches on the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee blog</a>. If an entity you do business with has been affected, change your passwords and the passwords of any related accounts immediately.</p>
<h2><strong>Know the warning signs of identity theft</strong></h2>
<p>Knowing possible signs of identity theft can help you catch it early so that you can continue to enjoy your time online. Educate yourself and your family about these warning signs, ensuring everybody stays safe. Here are some possible indications identity thieves have targeted you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You receive phone calls from debt collectors about accounts you aren’t familiar with. </strong>Don’t provide personal information over the phone immediately. Check your credit report to get the details about the debts in question.</li>
<li><strong>Your credit score experiences unexplained changes.</strong> Get a copy of your credit report from the major credit reporting agencies to find out why.</li>
<li><strong>Your bank accounts or credit cards have unknown charges you (and your family) can’t account for. </strong>Contact your financial institution to report the suspected fraud, providing relevant documentation to back up your claims. You can also report fraud to <a href="https://www.usa.gov/stop-scams-frauds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your local government</a>.</li>
<li><strong>You receive a fraud alert from your financial institution. </strong>Check any activity deemed potentially fraudulent as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>You get mail addressed to another person’s name.</strong> This could include medical bills, W-2 forms related to unfamiliar employers, or credit card bills, for example. Follow up with the relevant institution.</li>
<li><strong>You experience problems with your tax return </strong>For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may reject your filing if someone else has already filed in your name (to get your tax refund). Contact the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS</a><a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fraud department</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You’re only a step away from better protection</strong></h2>
<p>The internet keeps all of us connected, but that’s why identity theft protection is important. With people increasingly connected, doing more, and sharing more online, cybercriminals can pinpoint weaknesses and take advantage. Hackers are ready to leverage your information for personal gain, and identity theft is no exception.</p>
<p>McAfee is here to help. McAfee’s <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity protection services</a> provide 24/7 monitoring of your email addresses and bank accounts, providing up to $1 million worth of ID theft coverage.

To help you enjoy every minute of it, though, it’s good to be aware of what less savory characters are up to.</p>
<p>And they sure have been busy. In fact, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-2-2-million-fraud-reports-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. </a><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-2-2-million-fraud-reports-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal</a><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-2-2-million-fraud-reports-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Trade Commission</a> (FTC) received 2.1 million fraud reports in 2020. What is identity theft? Well, it’s the fraudulent use of another individual’s name and details for personal gain.</p>
<p>Those affected by identity fraud may see a dip in their finances and credit scores. They may also deal with anxiety around financial security going forward. However, while it’s important to be aware of the threat of identity theft, this shouldn’t be cause for alarm. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/guide-protecting-your-digital-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools and techniques</a> that can help protect you and your family so you can continue to enjoy everything modern technology has to offer.</p>
<p>The first step in protecting yourself? Educate yourself. Understanding the different types of identity theft can help you safeguard yourself and your loved ones so that you can continue all your favorite online activities. Here we’ll define and explore the different types of identity theft to watch out for.</p>
<h2><strong>What is identity theft?</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve all probably heard of identity theft, but what is it? Identity theft is when someone uses another person’s financial or personal data, usually for monetary gain. This means a fraudster may take sensitive information like names, birthdates, Social Security numbers, driver’s license details, addresses, and bank account numbers or credit card numbers. They might then use this information to make purchases, open credit cards, and even use health insurance to get medical care.</p>
<h2><strong>5 types of identity theft</strong></h2>
<p>A little knowledge can go a long way in stopping cybercriminals in their tracks — especially since they’re becoming more sophisticated and coming up with new schemes every day.</p>
<p>Here are five common types of identity theft to help you stay one step ahead of hackers.</p>
<h3><strong>Financial identity theft</strong></h3>
<p>Financial identity theft is when one person uses another’s personal data for financial benefit. This is the most common form of identity theft (including the credit card example described above). Financial identity theft can take multiple forms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fraudsters</strong><strong> may use your credit card information to buy things.</strong> We all love to shop online — even criminals. Unfortunately, this issue has become especially prevalent thanks to online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li><strong>Hackers</strong><strong> may steal funds from your bank account. </strong>Sometimes, the amount might be so small that it seems inconsequential, totaling just a few dollars. However, criminals can rack up millions in damages if they target enough people in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Criminals may open new accounts using your Social Security number and other data. </strong>For example, a person may use your data to open a new line of credit. They then run through the credit line, leaving you to foot the bill.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that it’s easy to protect yourself against financial identity theft by checking your bank accounts, credit card statements, and bills. If you see an unexplained charge, contact your credit card company or bank immediately to report it. Also, check your credit report for changes in your score. An unexplained decrease in your score could mean fraudulent activity. You can do this through <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>, where you can get a free credit report every 12 months from each of the three major credit bureaus.</p>
<p>Another idea is to place a one-year fraud alert on your credit reports to keep people from opening new accounts in your name. This encourages creditors and lenders to take extra precautions to verify your identity before granting any loans or credit increases. You can also place a security freeze on your credit report, which blocks others from accessing it to extend credit.</p>
<h3><strong>Medical identity theft</strong></h3>
<p>This might not seem like a real form of identity theft, but it happens. Medical identity theft is when a criminal poses as another person to obtain health care services. In fact, fraudsters may use your name and insurance information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get prescriptions for drugs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access medical services</strong>, from checkups to costly surgeries.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain medical devices and supplies</strong>, such as wheelchairs or hearing aids.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can result in you having bills for prescriptions, services, or devices you didn’t need, ask for, or even receive. Your health care and insurance records may even have these things added to them. An inaccurate medical record can make it harder for you to get the care you need in the future and even impact insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can help minimize the risk of medical identity theft by regularly reviewing your medical claims. Contact your insurer if you see unfamiliar procedures, prescriptions, or services. You’ll also want to let your health care provider know so that they can ensure your medical files are correct. Finally, consider filing a complaint with the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS).</p>
<h3><strong>Criminal identity theft</strong></h3>
<p>Criminal identity theft occurs when a person arrested by law enforcement uses someone else’s name instead of providing theirs. They might be able to pass this off by creating a fake ID or using a stolen ID, like your driver’s license, to show to the police. This type of fraud can be difficult to detect until the consequences are evident, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You receive a court summons. </strong>For example, the courts may issue a summons if a criminal uses your ID for unpaid parking tickets.</li>
<li><strong>A bench warrant is issued for your arrest. </strong>Unresolved problems like unpaid parking tickets can also result in a judge issuing a bench warrant. You may then be taken into custody at any time, even during a routine traffic stop.</li>
<li><strong>A background check is issued. </strong>Sometimes, police will keep an identity theft victim in their database, noting it as an alias for the real criminal. This can result in a false criminal record showing up on your background check. This can cause problems with potential landlords and employers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect yourself against criminal identity theft by safeguarding your ID. If your license or state-issued ID is lost or stolen, report it to the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and law enforcement. Also, limit the information you share online (and encourage family members to do the same). For example, if your teen got their first driver’s license and wants to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/7-common-digital-behaviors-that-put-your-familys-privacy-at-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share a pic of it on </a><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/7-common-digital-behaviors-that-put-your-familys-privacy-at-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>, explain why this isn’t a good idea.</p>
<h3><strong>Synthetic identity theft</strong></h3>
<p>As one of the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/audio-repository/ftw-podcast-synthetic-ids-010220.mp3/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing types of financial crime</a> in the U.S., synthetic identity theft involves creating fake identities using real people’s information. Fraudsters may use data like birthdates, addresses, and Social Security numbers from real people, blending them to create a fake profile. They can then use this persona to apply for loans or credit cards or commit other financial crimes. Kids and older adults tend to be vulnerable to this type of fraud since they rarely use their SSNs.</p>
<p>The most important thing about synthetic identity theft is knowing the signs and acting fast. Keep an eye out for any mail with your address on it but addressed to a different name and phone calls or mail about new credit accounts. You can further protect yourself by regularly checking your credit reports for unexplained changes and placing a security freeze on them.</p>
<p>There are also identity monitoring services available, which scan the internet, including the dark web, for breached Social Security numbers. If you suspect you or a loved one is the victim of synthetic identity theft, contact the relevant financial institutions to alert them.</p>
<h3><strong>Child identity theft</strong></h3>
<p>We all want to protect our children from bad actors, especially when it comes to identity theft. Child identity theft involves using a minor’s information to commit financial fraud, like opening a new account or line of credit under the child’s name. The thief may even use the child’s identity to get a driver’s license, apply for government benefits, or buy a house. This is often easier than targeting an adult because most kids don’t have credit reports or financial accounts, making them a clean slate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, child identity theft is often perpetrated within the family by a relative who has access to the child’s data like their birthdate and address. And many children don’t realize they’ve been targeted until they’re older — for example, when they try to take out a student loan. By this point, the issue may have been escalating for years. So, it’s important as a parent to be aware of child identity theft.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to check whether your child has a credit report with any of the three big credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian). If so, review the report and report any fraudulent activity. You can also place a freeze on your child’s credit report to help minimize the risk of future fraud.</p>
<h2><strong>How do you know if you’re a victim of identity theft?</strong></h2>
<p>No one wants to be left in the dark when it comes to identity theft, so knowing the signs can help you spot it and take action quickly. This can help stop fraud in its tracks, minimizing both immediate damage and long-term repercussions. Some warning signs that may indicate identity theft include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You get a fraud alert from a financial institution. </strong>To protect customers against identity thieves’ scams, most banks have security protocols to pinpoint potential data breaches. For example, if you live in the U.S., but a purchase is made using your credit card information in London, your bank may stop the transaction and send you a credit card fraud alert.</li>
<li><strong>There are unexplained changes in your credit score. </strong>Your credit score going up can mean someone is trying to extend credit in your name (with the intent to run through it). A dip in your score could indicate anything from a loan application to a bill going to collection. You can <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/get-my-free-credit-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a free copy of your </a><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/get-my-free-credit-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit report</a> from the three major credit bureaus every 12 months.</li>
<li><strong>There are changes to your financial accounts. </strong>Check your bank statements at least once a month, keeping an eye out for unfamiliar transactions or withdrawals. Also, check for an increase in your line of credit or a new credit card account (which someone else may have requested in your name).</li>
<li><strong>A loan or credit card application is denied.</strong> If you apply for a new credit card or a loan and are turned down, find out why. If you thought you had good credit, double-check your current credit history. Identity theft can result in your credit score</li>
<li><strong>You get phone calls from debt collectors.</strong> If collection agencies start calling you about unfamiliar debts, someone else might be using your information to open financial accounts or take out lines of credit. Don’t divulge any personal information on the phone but do check your credit report to see what debts they’re referring to.</li>
<li><strong>You get unfamiliar mail.</strong> If you get mail sent to your address that’s clearly for someone else, that person might be using your address for personal gain. Be wary if you receive medical bills in the mail that you don’t recognize or W-2 forms for companies you’ve never worked for.</li>
<li><strong>You experience tax return</strong> If you get a tax transcript you didn’t ask for, or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rejects your e-filing, identity theft might be to blame. Some thieves will file fraudulent returns to get the victim’s refund. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact the </a><a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRS</a> <a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud alert</a><a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/tax-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> department</a>.</li>

<p>In this post we want to show how an endpoint solution with performant memory scanning capabilities can effectively detect active exploitation scenarios and complement network security capabilities your company has implemented.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As it is becoming the norm lately, a new vulnerability affecting a widely used library was recently released just in time for the Holidays. As detailed in our <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/log4shell-vulnerability-is-the-coal-in-our-stocking-for-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATR blog</a>, CVE-2021-44228 reported a vulnerability in the Log4J Java library affecting applications and web sites using the library to perform logging.</p>
<p>This vulnerability allows an attacker to<em> coerce</em> the vulnerable site or application to load and execute a malicious Java code from an untrusted remote location. Attack vectors are varied but the most common is associated with the attacker sending crafted strings as part of a network protocol to the target machine, like for example a modified HTTP Header sent as part of a POST request.</p>
<p>That is the reason many defenders are focusing their efforts on detecting the malicious strings through the network traffic. However, network signatures can be bypassed and there are reports confirming threat actors are adapting their network attacks with various forms of obfuscation to defeat network scanning.  The following image shows some of the current obfuscation techniques that have been observed or reported related to this attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-133357 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png" alt="" width="618" height="184" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1.png 618w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-300x89.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-205x61.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://github.com/mcb2Eexe/Log4j2-Obfucation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://github.com/mcb2Eexe/Log4j2-Obfucation</em></a></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that network protection solutions are not useful against this attack. Network security platforms provide a first layer of defense and should be used as part of a defensible security architecture (security risk treatment strategy), augmented by additional layers of protection, detection, visibility, and response. Modern endpoint solutions are uniquely positioned to complement network-based capabilities with in-depth host-based visibility of system processes, like <em>in-memory scanning</em> and rapid response orchestration. This combination results in a robust defense against threats like Log4Shell.</p>
<h2>‘I See You’: Memory Scanning #FTW</h2>
<p>To understand how memory scanning can help complement the network security platforms after a connection arrives to the endpoint and defeating the obfuscation layers, let&#8217;s take a look at the diagram below, describing the <em>flow of execution</em> for a common web based Log4J attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-133360" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1024x518.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1024x518.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-300x152.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-768x389.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-205x104.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Let’s outline what happens:</p>
<p>In Step 1, an attacker sends a specially crafted string to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. This string, as we have seen, can be obfuscated to bypass network-based signatures.</p>
<p>In Step 2, the application proceeds to de-obfuscate this string to load it in memory. Once loaded into memory, the application initiates a LDAP connection to request the address of where the malicious class is located.</p>
<p>In Step 3, the attacker-controlled LDAP server responds with the location of the <em>malicious Class file</em> by indicating the HTTP URL address of where it is hosted.</p>
<p>In Step 4, the vulnerable application will proceed to initiate a download for that malicious class file.</p>
<p>In Step 5, the vulnerable application will load and run the malicious class file from step 4.</p>
<p>At this moment, the attacker achieves code execution on the target, leaving traces that may provide visibility on this activity for the defender. For example, spawning additional processes or touching files and registry keys after an exploitation</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s imagine we could trigger a memory scan at some point in this execution flow to detect the presence of the malicious code. In general, scanning the memory of an endpoint is expensive from a processing perspective, therefore it’s not something that can be done continuously or even very often, but under specific circumstances it can be achieved with precision.</p>
<p>So, suppose we could trigger a memory scan at any point after step (2). We would have a <em>high probability to find the de-obfuscated string</em> used within the process memory at that time. If the memory is scanned after the malicious class file is downloaded, that content would also be available for scanning in its de-obfuscated form.</p>
<p>Such possibilities make the memory signature performant, and efficient, given the timing of the detection mainly depends on the trigger used to start the memory scan.</p>
<p>These technical capabilities are possible in ENS, let us show you how to do that!</p>
<h2>Endpoint Security Expert Rules meets Memory Scan</h2>
<p>In ENS (Endpoint Security) 10.7 update 4 and above, there is a powerful security feature available to every defender, and WE absolutely love it, which is the ability to trigger a memory scan from an Expert Rule.</p>
<p>We have talked about <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/using-expert-rules-in-ens-10-5-3-to-prevent-malicious-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expert Rules</a> before, these are customizable access control rules which the end-user uses to detect suspicious activity not commonly seen by other scanners. McAfee Enterprise also provides community Expert Rules mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix through our public <a href="https://github.com/mcafee/ExpertRules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The feature we are interested in now is the ability to trigger a memory scan when an Expert Rule fires. That would allow us to target the applications vulnerable to Log4J and identify the moment they are being exploited.</p>
<p>Consider the following rule:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133363" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3.png" alt="" width="470" height="480" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3.png 470w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-294x300.png 294w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-126x129.png 126w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-24x24.png 24w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-48x48.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>In the example rule above, we see a section defining ACTORS (inside the Process {&#8230;} section) and TARGETS (inside the Target {&#8230;} section). We define as actors any process that may be vulnerable to the Log4J exploit. In this case <em>JAVA.EXE</em> for standalone Java applications and<em> TOMCAT?.EXE</em> for Apache web-based applications. Either of these processes need to load both <em>JAVA.DLL</em> and <em>JVM.DLL </em>to ensure the Java runtime is active.</p>
<p>In the target section we add any potential payload of the attack. As Expert Rules are not focused on network traffic, we need to focus on the last step of the execution flow, which is when the payload is executed. Additional triggers like files or registry keys accessed can be added as more information about exploits become available. We may also have in this section any exclusion of valid behavior as shown in the example above with the “<em>Exclude</em>” on command line parameter. This exclusion is something customers can tailor to their environment to avoid false positives.</p>
<p>This <em>expert rule</em> will trigger when any <em>ACTOR </em>process spawns any of the <em>TARGET </em>payloads. If the rule were just that, one could see it would not be too effective in detecting the exploit and would probably cause many false positives.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>But notice this line</u> </em></strong>at the beginning of the rule:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133366" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4.png" alt="" width="472" height="54" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4.png 472w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-300x34.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-205x23.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></p>
<p>This instruction tells ENS 10.7 to initiate a memory scan against the <em>ACTOR</em> process which caused the expert rule to trigger, and <strong><em><u>only that process</u></em></strong>. Now we have a reliable trigger for a performant memory scan, avoiding the performance issues of a blind memory scan, and it is done at a time very close to the initial exploitation attempt, which guarantees the de-obfuscated string will be in memory.</p>
<p>The second part of this solution is executed by the <i>AV DAT Engine </i>when it scans the memory of the process which triggered the <i>Expert Rule</i>. Once this string is found, a detection will occur on the affected process, and the action configured in the <i>Expert Rule</i> <i>REACTION</i> line will be applied. More information about available actions are described in <a title="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95091" contenteditable="false" href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KB95901 – McAfee Enterprise coverage for Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228 Remote Code Execution</a>. Note we recommend customers to use the REPORT action initially until they have sorted out what processes they need to monitor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133369" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5.png" alt="" width="936" height="104" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-300x33.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-768x85.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-205x23.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<p>The first event highlighted above is the<em> Expert Rule </em>triggering for a suspicious process spawning from <em>JAVA.EXE</em>, and the second shows the <em>AV DAT detection </em>indicating the memory of that process had signatures of the exploit.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>IF only the Expert Rule detection was present and NOT the JNDI/Log4J-Exploit event, it would indicate a program has executed children processes considered suspicious, and customers are advised to review the event and improve the Expert Rule accordingly.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>However, IF, both the Expert Rule and JNDI/Log4j-Exploit events are triggered for the same program, we have confidently detected the presence of the process being exploited.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>McAfee Enterprise provides more information about our current coverage for Log4J vulnerability in </em><a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95091">KB95901 &#8211; McAfee Enterprise coverage for Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228 Remote Code Execution</a><em>. This article contain links to download the Expert Rule and the associated EXTRA.DAT, as well as details on how to set up ePO to use them in your environment.</em></p>
<p>Customers who want to implement this solution are invited to review the instructions in the KB and associated documentation. It is highly recommended to review the <em>Expert Rule</em> and customize it to your environment.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To protect an environment against attacks like LOG4J, a layered strategy comprised of network security coupled by targeted endpoint memory scans allows defenders to effectively detect and prevent the attack execution flow against vulnerable systems exposed via network vectors.</p>
<p>Our ENS Expert Rules and Custom Scan reactions are designed to enable defenders<em> with such capabilities so they can apply precise countermeasures against these emerging threats.</em></p>

A week spent kicking up your heels and living life to the max without any parental supervision at all! Oh, the sleepless nights many of us parents have had! And once Christmas and New Year celebrations are done, he’ll be heading away to University to ‘live his best life’ away from his dedicated cyber mother!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And of course, I’m delighted for him, although secretly devastated to be losing my baby boy. But it does prompt the question, am I now done with cyber parenting? Is my work here officially done?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">I remember when my kids were little, my mother shared some words of wisdom with me: ‘Alex, you never stop being a parent. The kids are the same, it’s just the issues that change.’ And she was so right. As our boys have grown up, we’ve been less involved in their day-to-day needs but still very much needed. Whether it’s to help review a work contract, provide advice on an issue with a flatmate or help pick out a suit, the parenting hasn’t stopped instead entered a new chapter. And of course, there’s no doubt that having interested, devoted parents at the end of the telephone &#8211; day or night – makes navigating life so much easier!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And when it comes to their digital lives, it’s the same story. While we have no reason to be involved in their day-to-day online lives, we have definitely been called upon to help them troubleshoot situations from receiving inappropriate messages, identifying potential scams or managing terse exchanges.  And, might I add, I have also proactively offered my advice on the appropriateness of pictures they have shared online &#8211; many times!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Every few days, I’ll check out my boys’ socials. Not only does it give me a ‘feel’ for what’s happening in their lives – where they’ve been and who with – it also allows me to check they are making good decisions about what they share.

<p><span data-contrast="none">And it goes without saying that your ability to provide input to their digital lives will only happen if you don’t cross boundaries! So, never embarrass them.

<p><span data-contrast="none">So, if you have a school leaver in your family and you’re not sure whether your job is done, I’m here to confirm that you’ll still be required for a very long time! Whether they know it or not, our big kids will still continue to need a sprinkling of our wisdom and experience for years to come. And even though they may have fled the nest, remember you will always be one of their most influential role models. So, make sure your digital life is in good shape too because as American novelist James Baldwin shares: ‘Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.’</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Privacy Protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Privacy protection means keeping the information you’d rather keep to yourself from getting in the hands of advertisers, cybercriminals, and nefarious groups seeking to use your personal details for their benefit. To boost your online privacy, all it takes is a few thoughtful additions to your daily browsing, email, and social media routine. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">First, think carefully about your social media habits. Do you post everything about your day and childhood, pin your location, and share photos of documents that include your full name, birthday, or address? You may want to consider cutting back on what you broadcast on the internet, especially if your account is public for anyone to view. Unfortunately, while your friends and family may love your status updates, cybercriminals love them more. After only minutes of snooping, cybercriminals can glean enough personal details about you to impersonate you or target a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/social-engineering-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social engineering</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> attempt at you. To keep your private information private, limit what you share on social media and pare down your follower and friend lists to only people you know in real life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another way to protect your privacy is to use a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn/mcafee-safe-connect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">virtual private network (VPN)</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. A VPN allows you to remain completely anonymous online, scrambling your location and your connection. Some users may swear by incognito mode for safe browsing; however, only a VPN can ensure your privacy is protected. Incognito mode, also known as private mode, deletes your browsing history, cookies, and site data on your device once you log out of a session. While incognito mode prevents someone from snooping on your browsing history if they gain access to your device, you’re still vulnerable to cyber criminals intruding on your sensitive transactions.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A VPN is especially important when you’re logged on to a public network, like those in coffee shops, libraries, and transportation hubs. Cybercriminals often lurk on non-password-protected Wi-Fi networks and eavesdrop on people paying bills or online shopping to steal their credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You should also invest in antivirus software, and turn on automatic updates so you can be confident that you are always running the most secure, recent version. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> is an all-in-one service that protects your personal information and privacy. It also includes premium antivirus software, safe browsing, and a VPN.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Another type of online security you need is protection against identity theft. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Identity theft</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> is a broad term that can apply to the following unfortunate situations:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In each case, the consequences can be a hassle to deal with and may even affect your finances, credit score, and ability to secure loans, a mortgage, or future credit cards. One way to keep your identity secure is to guard your PII carefully. Never give out your Social Security Number unless it’s absolutely necessary and never share it over email. Also, stay on top of the news and take action immediately if a company that houses your PII is breached by a cybersecurity attack. That way you can quickly take action to hopefully protect your account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Sometimes, you do everything right and a cybercriminal still gets their hands on your PII, like through a breach at a company with which you have an account. You may want to invest in an identity protection service that provides dark web monitoring and alerts you to unusual activity that could indicate identity theft. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Identity Protection Service</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> is easy to set up and offers extensive monitoring of over 60 types of PII. McAfee notifies identity theft victims up to 10 months sooner than similar identity monitoring services and grants $1 million in ID theft coverage to help you get back on your feet if a cybercriminal steals your identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Device Security</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Device security covers the actions you take to keep your physical devices safe from thieves and harmful software, like viruses and malware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The first step to keeping your laptops, tablets, and smartphones safe is to know where your devices are at all times and never let anyone you don’t know to use them. Password-protect your devices, so in the case, you leave your laptop in a taxi or forget your phone at a coffee shop, you know that your information stored within is inaccessible. Back up your files frequently so if you do lose a device and have to wipe it remotely, you don’t lose all your photos or work documents.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another component of device security is defending against malicious software. Viruses and malware can make their way onto your devices through several avenues, including sketchy websites, dishonest downloads, phishing schemes, and clicking on ads. Be careful on what you click on and use common sense when visiting websites that look untrustworthy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Where people go, hackers are sure to follow. So it’s no surprise hackers have set up shop on social media.

But reported losses hit $117 million in just the first six months of 2020, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Among these losses are cases of identity theft, where criminals use social media to gather personal information and build profiles of potential victims they can target. Just as we discussed in our recent blog, “</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/can-thieves-steal-identities-with-only-a-name-and-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Can thieves steal identities with only a name and address?</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">” these bits of information are important pieces in the larger jigsaw puzzle that is your overall identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Quizzes and surveys</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“What’s your spooky Halloween name?” or “What’s your professional wrestler name?” You’ve probably seen a few of those and similar quizzes in your feed where you use the street you grew up on, your birthdate, your favorite song, and maybe the name of a beloved first pet to cook up a silly name or some other result. Of course, these are pieces of personal information, sometimes the answer to commonly used security questions by banks and other financial institutions. (Like, what was the model of your first car?) With this info in hand, a hacker could attempt to gain access to your accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Similarly, scammers will also post surveys with the offer of a gift card to a popular retailer. All you have to do is fork over your personal info. Of course, there’s no gift card coming.

What they all have in common is that they’re run by scammers who want your information, money or both. If this sounds familiar, like those old emails about transferring funds for a prince in some faraway nation, it is. Many of these scams simply made the jump from email to social media platforms.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid them:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Research any offer, business opportunity, or organization that reaches out to you. A good trick is to do a search of the organization’s name plus the term “scam” or “review” or “complaint” to see if anything sketchy comes up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If there’s one government official that scammers like use to put a scare in you, it’s the tax collector. These scammers will use social media messaging (and other mediums like emails, texts, and phone calls) to pose as an official that’s either demanding back taxes or offering a refund or credit—all of which are bogus and all of which involve you handing over your personal info, money, or both. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid them:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Delete the message. In the U.S., the IRS and other government agencies will </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">never</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> reach out to you in this way or ask you for your personal information. Likewise, they won’t demand payment via wire transfer, gift cards, or cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Only scammers will.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These are far more targeted than the scams listed above, because they’re targeted and often rely upon specific information about you and your family. Thanks to social media, scammers can gain access to that info and use it against you. One example is the “grandkid scam” where a hacker impersonates a grandchild and asks a grandparent for money. Similarly, there are family emergency scams where a bad actor sends a message that a family member was in an accident or arrested and needs money quickly. In all, they rely on a phony story that often involves someone close to you who’s in need or in trouble.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid them:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Take a deep breath and confirm the situation. Reach out to the person in question or another friend or family member to see if there really is a concern. Don’t jump to pay right away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is one of the most targeted attacks of all—the con artist who strikes up an online relationship to bilk a victim out of money. Found everywhere from social media sites to dating apps to online forums, this scam involves creating a phony profile and a phony story to go with it. From there, the scammer will communicate several times a day, perhaps talking about their exotic job in some exotic location. They’ll build trust along the way and eventually ask the victim to wire money or purchase gift cards. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid them:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Bottom line, if someone you’ve never met in person asks you for money online, it’s a good bet that it’s a scam. Don’t do it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now with an idea of the bad actors are up to out there, here’s a quick rundown of things you can do to protect yourself further from the social media scams they’re trying to pull.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

This will circulate less of your personal information in public. However, consider anything you do or post on social media as public information. (Plenty of people can still see it, copy it, and pass it along.) Likewise, pare back the information you provide in your profile, like your birthday, the high school you attended, and so on. The less you put out there, the less a scammer can use against you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

This willingness could lower your guard when a scammer comes calling. Instead, try to look at the messages you receive beyond face value. Does something seem unusual about the language or request? What could be the motivation behind it? Pausing and considering questions like these could spare some headaches.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

However, if you like having a larger list of friends and followers, be aware that any personal info you share is effectively being broadcast on a small scale—potentially to people you don’t really know well at all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="none">But no need to get your tinsel in a tangle! At McAfee, we’re empowering consumers to live their digital lives with confidence by providing tips and tools for sidestepping cyber-grinches. Here are the top scams to look out for this holiday season so you can be on your merry way: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Phishing Emails Boasting Big-ticket Items </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Phishing may be one of the older tricks in the book, but it is still a favorite standby for cybercriminals as phishing tactics become more sophisticated. According to Bleeping Computer, scammers tend to target holiday shoppers with emails advertising big-ticket or hard-to-find items to entice them to click on a malicious link.</span><span data-contrast="none">2</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">For example, cybercriminals could send a phishing email promising a sweet deal —often referred to as the discount scam — on the latest gaming system. Jumping at the opportunity to score such a great gift for a low price, an unsuspecting holiday shopper might click on the link and swiftly hand over their credit card details. But instead of receiving the gaming system, they receive alerts of suspicious purchases from their bank — purchases that cybercriminals made with their credit card information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Fake Websites and Ads</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the holidays, many brands increase their online advertising to boost sales. However, cyber-grinches will likely take advantage of this trend by creating fake websites and ads impersonating companies that consumers know and love. For example, cybercriminals can create fake websites and ads promoting unrealistic discounts and bargains that look remarkably similar to an online retailer’s site. If a customer clicks on the fake website and makes a “purchase” by inputting their credit card information, the scammers will then be able to use this data to make fraudulent purchases elsewhere. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Fraudulent Social Media Posts </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Many consumers rely on social media to stay up-to-date on the latest deals, and scammers are eagerly looking for ways to take advantage. To target holiday shoppers via Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc., criminals use fake social media posts offering vouchers, gift cards, freebies, and contests in the hopes that the user will click on the post and hand over their personal or financial information. Perhaps a user comes across a fake contest for a $1,000 Amazon gift card on Instagram — all they have to do is enter their login credentials to enter. Little do they know that this contest has been formulated by scammers and submitting their login for entry is just handing over their data for cyber-scrooges to exploit. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Criminals can also take advantage of shoppable social media posts to target holiday shoppers with advertisements for non-existent or counterfeit items. Today, 130 million Instagram users tap on shoppable posts to learn more about products every month. It’s likely that these users will also rely on shoppable posts to interact with products they’re interested in purchasing for holiday gifts.</span><span data-contrast="none">3</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Cybercriminals can entice these users by creating fraudulent social media ads for products they don’t actually have. If an unsuspecting shopper purchases through the fake ad, their financial information will not only find its way into the hands of the scammer, but they also won’t receive what they initially paid for. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">According to the Wall Street Journal, travel and charity scams also tend to spike around the holidays.</span><span data-contrast="none">4</span><span data-contrast="none"> Travel scams could show up in the form of an email stating that a booking has been canceled, sending you to a fake website where you’re asked to enter your credit card number to set up a new reservation. You could also receive an email directing you to a clone site offering deals on a house rental, flight, or hotel room that seems too good to be true — as long as you hold your reservation with a deposit. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Cybercriminals also know that consumers tend to make charitable donations around the holidays, and many are quick to take advantage. A charity scam might target victims via social media feeds, asking people to donate to a fake organization. Consumers should always do their research on a charity before they donate to prevent money from ending up in a scammer’s pocket. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">To prevent cyber-grinches from stealing your money, data, and festive spirit, follow these tips so you can continue to make merry during the holiday shopping season:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><strong>INFECTION CHAIN</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>The victim will receive a Docusign-based phishing email.</li>
<li>On clicking on the link (hxxp://mettlybothe.com/8/forum[.]php), a Word Document file is downloaded.</li>
<li>On Enabling the macro content in Microsoft Word, the macro drops an embedded OLE, a password-protected macro-infected document file and launches it.</li>
<li>This second Document file drops the main Hancitor DLL (Dynamic Link Library) payload.</li>
<li>The DLL payload is then executed via rundll32.exe.</li>
</ol>
<figure id="attachment_132937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132937" style="width: 648px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-132937" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-2-–-Infection-Chain.png" alt="Figure 2 – Infection Chain" width="648" height="435" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-2-–-Infection-Chain.png 648w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-2-–-Infection-Chain-300x201.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-2-–-Infection-Chain-192x129.png 192w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132937" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2 – Infection Chain</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</strong></h2>
<p>Malware authors send the victims a phishing email containing a link as shown in the below screenshot (Figure 3). The usual Docusign theme is used in this recent Hancitor wave. This phishing email contains a link to the original malicious word document. On clicking the link, the Malicious Doc file is downloaded.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132940" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132940" style="width: 785px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-132940" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-3-–-Phishing-mail-pretending-to-be-DocuSign.png" alt="Figure 3 – Phishing mail pretending to be DocuSign" width="785" height="536" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-3-–-Phishing-mail-pretending-to-be-DocuSign.png 785w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-3-–-Phishing-mail-pretending-to-be-DocuSign-300x205.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-3-–-Phishing-mail-pretending-to-be-DocuSign-768x524.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-3-–-Phishing-mail-pretending-to-be-DocuSign-189x129.png 189w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132940" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3 – Phishing mail pretending to be DocuSign</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the macros are disabled by default configuration, malware authors try to lure victims into believing that the file is from legitimate organizations or individuals and will ask victims to enable editing and content to start the execution of macros. The screenshot below (Figure 4) is the lure technique that was observed in this current wave.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132943" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-132943" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-1024x601.png" alt="Figure 4 – Document Face" width="1024" height="601" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-1024x601.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-300x176.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-768x451.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-1536x902.png 1536w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face-205x120.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-4-–-Document-Face.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132943" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4 – Document Face</figcaption></figure>
<p>As soon as the victim enables editing, malicious macros are executed via the Document_Open function.</p>
<p>There is an OLE object embedded in the Doc file. The screenshot below (Figure 5) highlights the object as an icon.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132946" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-132946 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5-–-OLE-embedded-object-marked-inside-red-circle.png" alt="Figure 5 – OLE embedded object marked inside red circle" width="838" height="349" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5-–-OLE-embedded-object-marked-inside-red-circle.png 838w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5-–-OLE-embedded-object-marked-inside-red-circle-300x125.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5-–-OLE-embedded-object-marked-inside-red-circle-768x320.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5-–-OLE-embedded-object-marked-inside-red-circle-205x85.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132946" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5 – OLE embedded object marked inside the red circle</figcaption></figure>
<p>The loader VBA function, invoked by document_open, calls this random function (Figure 6), which moves the selection cursor to the exact location of the OLE object using the selection methods (.MoveDown, .MoveRight, .MoveTypeBackspace). Using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.selection.copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selection.Copy</a> method, it will copy the selected OLE object to the clipboard. Once it is copied in the clipboard it will be dropped under %temp% folder.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132949" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-132949" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-6-–-VBA-Function-to-Copy-content-to-Clipboard.png" alt="Figure 6 – VBA Function to Copy content to Clipboard" width="631" height="225" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-6-–-VBA-Function-to-Copy-content-to-Clipboard.png 631w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-6-–-VBA-Function-to-Copy-content-to-Clipboard-300x107.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-6-–-VBA-Function-to-Copy-content-to-Clipboard-205x73.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132949" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6 – VBA Function to Copy content to Clipboard</figcaption></figure>
<p>When an embedded object is being copied to the clipboard, it gets written to the temp directory as a file. This method is used by the malware author to drop a malicious word document instead of explicitly writing the file to disk using macro functions like the classic FileSystemObject.</p>
<p>In this case, the file was saved to the %temp% location with filename name <em>“zoro.kl</em>” as shown in the below screenshot (Fig 8). Fig 7 shows the corresponding procmon log involving the file write event.</p>

<p>Using the CreateObject(“Scripting.FileSystemObject”) method, the malware moves the file to a new location <em>\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates </em>and renames it to “<em>zoro.doc”<strong>.</strong></em></p>

<p>Zoro.doc uses the same techniques to copy and drop the next payload as we saw earlier. The only difference is that it has a DLL as the embedded OLE object.</p>
<p>It drops the file in the %temp% folder using clipboard with the name <em>“gelforr.dap”. </em>Again, it moves gelforr.dap DLL file to <em>\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates </em>(Figure 12)<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Right now, as this situation evolves, the best step is to keep your eyes open. If the app, service, site, or game you’re on performs strangely, consider signing out and closing it down. Then, perform a security scan on your device to check for viruses, malware, or other threats. Follow the guidance from your online protection software if any results come up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You may also consider limiting your app and service usage to the most important activities. If it’s not an urgent or important online task or activity, see about putting it off until more is known.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

<p>On December 9th, a vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) was released on <a href="https://twitter.com/P0rZ9/status/1468949890571337731">Twitter</a> along with a POC on <a href="https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc">Github</a> for the <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/">Apache Log4J</a> logging library. The bug was originally disclosed to Apache on November 24th by Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team. The impact of this vulnerability has the potential to be massive due to its effect on any product which has integrated the log4j library into its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29499867">applications.</a> This includes products from internet giants such as Apple iCloud, Steam, Samsung Cloud storage, but thousands of additional products and services will likely be vulnerable. This is just the beginning as Java is heavily used in applications spanning nearly every industry.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The vulnerability exists in the way the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) feature resolves variables.  When a JNDI reference is being written to a log, JNDI will fetch all requirements to resolve the variable. To complete this process, it will download and execute any remote classes required. This applies to both server-side and client-side applications since the main requirements for the vulnerability are any attacker-controlled input field and this input being passed to the log.</p>
<p>To orchestrate this attack, an attacker can use several different JNDI lookups. The most popular lookup currently being seen in both PoCs and active exploitation is utilizing LDAP; however, other lookups such as RMI and DNS are also viable attack vectors.  It’s worth noting that the simplistic LDAP/RMI attack vectors only work with older JDK versions. There are <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java">publications</a> that have demonstrated methods to circumvent this limitation to achieve code execution, albeit with added complexity to the attack.</p>
<p>Java object <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data">deserialization vulnerabilities</a> are not a new breed of vulnerabilities or attacks. Previous offensive research such as “<a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec">marshalsec</a>” can be applied to this vulnerability making code execution simplistic.</p>

<p><strong><em>**Update 12/14/2021**</em></strong></p>
<p>It has been confirmed that Log4j version 1.2 is vulnerable to similar attacks through the JMSAppender component and has been issued <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4104">CVE-2021-4104</a>. It is important to note this is <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4104">not</a> as easily exploitable as version 2.x. For exploitation to occur, JMSAppender must be enabled, and set with <em>TopicBindingName</em> or <em>TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName</em> configurations allowing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests. This is not the default configuration.</p>

<h2>What can be done about this?</h2>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">**Update 12/20/2021**</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Apache has released a new version of Log4j, version </span><a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html"><span data-contrast="none">2.17.0</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to address the latest DOS vulnerability.  Two additional classes were created that inherit from </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">StrSubstitutor</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> to deal with parsing strings that may contain user input.  These additions do not allow recursive evaluation.  Due to exploitation of this vulnerability leading to a DOS, it is considered less critical than the previously reported Log4j vulnerabilities which can lead to remote code execution.

<p><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">*****</span></i></b></p>
<p><strong><em>**Update 12/14/2021**</em></strong></p>
<p>Apache has released a new version of Log4j, version <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0">2.16.0</a>. This update disables JDNI by default requiring a user to explicitly turn the JNDI feature on and completely removes support for message lookups. When considering mitigations strategies for the Log4Shell vulnerabilities this should be considered the preferred method of mitigation.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>There is a lot of information about different ways to mitigate this vulnerability. The most important and complete mitigation is to update log4j to the stable release version <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html">2.17.0</a><strong>. </strong>Some sources are reporting that Java versions 6u211, 7u201, 8u191, and 11.0.1 are not vulnerable to this attack. This is not entirely the case. These versions are more resilient to the LDAP attack vector; however, they do <a href="https://mbechler.github.io/2021/12/10/PSA_Log4Shell_JNDI_Injection/">not</a> completely mitigate the vulnerability and are still susceptible to attack. To determine if a Java application is running a vulnerable version, a list of the impacted JAR files can be determined based on the hashes linked <a href="https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes">here</a>.</p>
<p>The McAfee Enterprise ATR (Advanced Threat Research) team has been closely tracking this vulnerability since it became known. Our initial goal was to determine the ease of exploitation using the public PoC, which we have reproduced and confirmed. This was done using the public <a href="https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app">Docker container</a>, and a client/server architecture leveraging both LDAP and RMI, along with <em>marshalsec</em> to exploit log4j version 2.14.1. We have posted a short video to demonstrate the reproduction for anyone who is struggling with this.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hbv2rUYVV6s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Going forward we plan to test variations of the exploit delivered using additional services such as DNS. We may update this document accordingly with results.</p>
<p>In the meantime, McAfee Enterprise has released a network signature <a href="https://kb.mcafee.com/agent/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95088">KB95088</a> for customers leveraging NSP (Network Security Platform). The signature detects attempts to exploit CVE-2021-44228 over LDAP. This signature may be expanded to include other protocols or services, and additional signatures may be released to complement coverage.</p>
<p>Full coverage for this vulnerability can be tracked from our Security Bulletin <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB95091">here</a>.</p>

A new piece of tech isn’t working the way it should. Or maybe setting it up is simply turning into a royal pain. Grrr, right? Just make sure that when you go on the hunt for some help, you don’t let a tech support scam get the better of you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like so many scams out there, tech support scams play on people’s emotions. Specifically, the frustration you feel when things don’t work right. You want that problem fixed </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">right now</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">. So much so that you may not pay close enough attention to that tech support link you found in a search or came across in an ad. Tech support that looks legitimate but isn’t.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Tech support scams make good money for bad actors. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/organized-cybercrime-the-big-business-behind-hacks-and-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the larger tech support scam operations organize and run themselves like a business</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, with call centers, marketing teams, finance groups, and so forth—and can rack up some serious profits to boot.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">They make their money in several ways. Sometimes they’ll charge large fees to fix a non-existent problem. Other times, they’ll install information-stealing malware under the guise of software that’s supposed to correct an issue. In some cases, they’ll ask for remote access to your computer to perform a diagnosis but access your computer to steal information instead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Fortunately, these scams are rather easy to spot. And avoid. If you know what to look for. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with a quick overview of tech support scams. They tend to work in two primary ways. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This could be a phone call that comes from someone posing as a rep from “Microsoft” or “Apple.” The scammer on the other end of the line will tell you that there’s something wrong with your computer or device. Something </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">urgently </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">wrong. And then offers a bogus solution to the bogus problem, often at a high cost. Similarly, they may reach you by way of a pop-up ad. Again telling you that your computer or device is in need of urgent repair. These can find you a few different ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Go to the source.

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Lastly, a good piece of general advice is to keep your devices and apps up to date. Regular updates often include security fixes and improvements that can help keep scammers and hackers at bay. You can set your devices and apps to download them automatically. And if you need to get an update or download it on your own, get it from the company’s official website. Stay away from third-party sites that may host malware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What to do if you think you’ve been scammed:</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Change your passwords.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This will provide protection if the scammer was able to access your account passwords in some form. While this can be a big task, it’s a vital one. A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that’s part of comprehensive online protection can make it much easier.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Run a malware and virus scan right away.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Delete files or apps that the software says is an issue. Do the same for other devices on your network too. Experienced and determined scammers can infect them as well simply by gaining access to one device on your network.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Stop payment.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Contact your bank, credit card company, online payment platform, or wire transfer service immediately to reverse the charges. File a fraud complaint as well. The sooner you act, the better chance you have of recovering some or all your money. (Note that this is a good reason to use credit cards for online purchases, as they afford extra protection that debit cards and other payment services do not.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Report the scam.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., you can contact </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/complaint" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">https://www.ftc.gov/complaint</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which reports the claim to thousands of law enforcement agencies. While they cannot resolve your individual issue, your report can help with broader investigations and build a case against scammers—which can make the internet safer for others. Their list of FAQs is particularly helpful too, answering important questions like “how do I get my money back?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Enjoy your stuff!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s to holiday tech that works. And to quick fixes when things don’t go as planned. In all, if you find yourself staring down a technical issue, go straight to the source for help as we’ve outlined above. As you can see, scammers have burrowed themselves alongside otherwise legitimate ads, search results, and forums online, ready to take advantage of you when you need to get things working right.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Likewise, keep an eye and ear open for those scammers who’ll reach out to you, particularly this time of year when so many people are getting so many new devices. Realizing that legitimate tech support won’t call you out of the blue is a great place to start. In all, go with the pros you know—the ones you can reach at the companies you trust.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

Maybe your phone is losing its charge way too quickly. Or one day it suddenly starts turning itself off and on again. Perhaps it’s running hot, so hot it’s hard to hold. Likewise, you might see outgoing calls that you never dialed or strange spikes in your data usage. Signs like these could mean that your smartphone’s been hacked.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Several signs of a potential smartphone hack can look like a technical issue, at least on the surface. Yet the fact is that these issues may be a symptom of a deeper problem, such as malware installed on your smartphone. Malware can eat up system resources or conflict with other apps and your operating system, all of which can cause your phone to act sluggish or erratically.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet, in a way, that’s good news. Because malware can run inefficiently on your phone and create hiccups both large and small, it can tip you off to its presence. And with all the important information we carry in the palms of our hands nowadays, that’s good news twice over. Knowing the signs, subtle or otherwise can alert you to an otherwise largely invisible problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether hackers physically sneak it onto your phone or by tricking you into installing it via </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/before-you-download-steer-clear-of-malicious-mobile-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a phony app</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a sketchy website, or a phishing attack, hacking software can create problems for you in a couple of ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some possible signs of hacking software on your phone include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Maybe you’ve seen some of the signs we mentioned earlier. Is your device operating slower, are web pages and apps harder to load, or does your battery never seem to keep a charge? These are all signs that you could have malware running in the background, zapping your phone’s resources.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like the performance issues above, malware or mining apps running in the background can burn extra computing power (and data). Aside from sapping performance, malware and mining apps can cause your phone to run hot or even overheat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you find apps you haven’t downloaded, or calls, texts, and emails that you didn’t send, that’s a red flag. A hacker may have hijacked your phone to send premium-rate calls or messages or to spread malware to your contacts. Similarly, if you see spikes in your data usage, that could be a sign of a hack as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malware can also be behind spammy pop-ups, changes to your home screen, or bookmarks to suspicious websites. In fact, if you see any configuration changes you didn’t personally make, this is another big clue that your smartphone has been hacked.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Device Dependence</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These conversations weigh heavy on parents for a good reason. According to a </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-census-8-to-18-full-report-updated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">report from Common Sense Media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, teens spend an average of seven hours and 22 minutes on their phones a day. Tweens (ages 8 to 12) spend four hours and 44 minutes daily. This is time outside of schoolwork. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since the pandemic, another study claims that screen time for teens doubled to 7.7 hours a day—plus 5 to 7 daily hours of online learning, according to a study published in </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2785686" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">JAMA Pediatrics</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition, according to the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666915321001438" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Journal of Affective Disorders Reports</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, children overall have been spending nearly triple the recommended amount of time on their screens.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The good news is that social media also became a powerful tool for kids during the pandemic. Social channels helped kids connect with peers and combat loneliness and other mental health challenges. Still, the poor habit of device dependence may have come with those benefits. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Revising Screen time</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While the debate continues over social media’s impact on kids and the research methodology continues to evolve, we can hold on to one clear truth: Any activity in excess can cause kids harm. When it comes to social media, </span><a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/blog/social-media-parenting-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">too much screen time</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> may contribute to sleep deprivation, a lack of healthy, and poor academics. In addition, studies show that mental health can be impacted by exposure to hate speech, sexual content, cyberbullying, and comparing oneself to others both physically and financially. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As parents, we know when our family&#8217;s wellbeing is in jeopardy. We see it even if we fail to acknowledge it right away. Our kids might become compelled to check their phones. In fact, they panic when they can’t check their likes and comments every few minutes. We notice the red eyes and moodiness at the breakfast table caused by a late-night Tic Tock marathon. We sense a surge of anxiety in our kids when technology goes from entertaining to distressing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thankfully, it’s never too late to help your kids better understand the impact of their actions and revise digital habits. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Establishing new habits</span></b></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Start small and make it fun.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the bestselling book </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Atomic Habits</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">,  author James Clear says, “The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us.” He adds, “The task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.” Lasting change, says clear, needs to be enjoyable, not a punishment. If the goal is shaving a few hours off your child&#8217;s screen time, consider connecting time limits to an enjoyable activity such as making a meal together or creating an art space in your home for creative projects. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Consider a device curfew.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The data is in: The bright screens (and blue light emitted from devices( can cause permanent sleep cycle and brain/melatonin issues, which can have a cascading effect on physical and mental health. Turning off (or limiting the use of) electronic devices at least 15-30 minutes before going to bed may help prevent any </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/zombie-scrolling-syndrome-zapping-childs-health/?hilite=%2527eye%2527" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">adverse effects of technology</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and screen use on sleep. Consider investing in </span><a href="https://home.mcafee.com/store/family-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">filtering software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that comes with the time limits the whole family can all agree on. Do your research to ensure your family&#8217;s technology functions to empower, educate, and entertain.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Encourage mindful media use.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Consider how your child uses their time before suggesting sweeping changes to your child&#8217;s screen time. Are they vegetating, or are they consciously engaged? Are they creating and learning? Are they engaging with others or stalking accounts and slipping into “comparison despair?” Are family and school responsibilities suffering? Is there a compulsion to post or thoughtfulness? All kids are different, and all online experiences vary. Encourage your child to take time to consider how they feel and what they think while they are using their technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Educate your kids—use facts.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to negotiate screen limits is to make sure your kids understand the impact of excess media. Balance includes tapping into the benefits of social media while also taking steps to protect the body’s need for physical activity, real-life relationships, goal-setting, creative activities, mindfulness, and self-reflection.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Helping kids manage and constantly revise their social media habits is a 24/7 endeavor from the minute they wake up to the minute they fall asleep. The biggest piece of that “management” plan and is keeping frequent, open, and honest communication a critical part of designing habits that encourage a healthy relationship with both peers and technology. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This news comes from a </span><a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">security report </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">that found these trojans cleverly posed as apps that people commonly search for, such as QR code scanners, fitness apps, and a bevy of other popular types of utilities. In fact, these phony apps contain trojans that are designed to steal banking information, harvest keystrokes as you enter account info, and even grab screenshots of what you&#8217;re doing on your phone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The trick with this malware is that it only activates after it is installed, which may or may not be apparent to the user. For the malware to activate, it requires an extra step, such as an in-app update (not through the Play Store), which then downloads the payload of malware onto the phone. In many cases, the bogus apps force users to make this update once the app is downloaded. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, while the apps that appeared in the Play Store may not have contained malware, they deliver the payload onto the user&#8217;s phone post-purchase from other servers, which is a reason why these malicious apps have not been readily flagged.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The good news is that there are ways you can spot these imposters. Major app marketplaces like Google Play and Apple’s App Store do their part to keep their virtual shelves free of malware, as </span><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">reported by Google</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple themselves</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Still, cybercriminals can find ways around these efforts. (That’s what they do, after all!) So, a little extra precaution on your part will help you stay safer. These steps can help: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Keep an eye on app permissions</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another way cyber criminals weasel their way into your device is by getting permissions to access things like your location, contacts, and photos—and they’ll use sketchy apps to do it. (Consider the long-running </span><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/these-android-flashlight-apps-could-be-spying-on-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">free flashlight app scams</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> mentioned above that requested up to more than 70 different permissions, such as the right to record audio, video, and access contacts.) So, pay close attention to what permissions the app is requesting when you’re installing it. If it’s asking for way more than you bargained for, like a simple game wanting access to your camera or microphone, it may be a scam. Delete the app and find a legitimate one that doesn’t ask for invasive permissions like that.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, you can check to see what permissions an app may request before downloading the app. In Google Play, scroll down the app listing and find “About this app.” From there, click “App permissions,” which will provide you with an informative list. In the iOS App Store, scroll down to “App Privacy” and tap “See Details” for a similar list. If you’re curious about permissions for apps that are already on your phone, </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-access-to-information-in-apps-iph251e92810/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">iPhone users can learn how to allow or revoke app permissions here</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9431959?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Android can do the same here</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Be wary of apps that prompt you for an in-app update</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While some apps (like games) rely on downloadable content from within the app, look out for apps that prompt you for an immediate update directly from the app. For the most part, the app you download from the store should be the most recent version and not require an update. Likewise, update your phone through the app store, not the app itself, which can help you avoid malware-based attacks like these. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) Review with a critical eye</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As with so many attacks, cybercriminals rely on people clicking links or tapping “download” without a second thought. Before you download, take time to do some quick research, which may uncover a few signs that the app is malicious. Check out the developer—have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">) Go with a strong recommendation</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Even better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5) Avoid third-party app stores</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Unlike Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure, third-party sites may not have that process in place. In fact, some third-party sites may intentionally host malicious apps as part of a broader scam. Granted, cybercriminals have found ways to work around Google and Apple’s review process, yet the chances of downloading a safe app from them are far greater than anywhere else. Furthermore, both Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps once discovered, making their stores that much safer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">6) Protect your smartphone with security software</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With all that we do on our phones, it’s important to get security software installed on them, just like we do on our computers and laptops. Whether you go with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive security software</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that protects all of your devices or </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wsandroid.suite&amp;shortlink=mmsandroid&amp;pid=Web&amp;c=Home%20page%20mobile%20blade%20-%20Android%20CTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">pick up an app in Google Play</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> or </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mcafee-mobile-security/id724596345#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple’s iOS App Store</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, you’ll have malware, web, and device security that’ll help you stay safe on your phone.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7) Update your phone’s operating system</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Hand-in-hand with installing security software is keeping your phone’s operating system up to date. Updates can fix vulnerabilities that cybercriminals rely on to pull off their malware-based attacks—it’s another tried and true method of keeping yourself safe and your phone running in tip-top shape. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Here are a few more things you can do:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Keep a close eye on your phone. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/help-i-think-my-phones-been-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Mobile malware sometimes leaves clues that your phone has been compromised, like making it run hot or perform poorly</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="9" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Keep tabs on your accounts. With any kind of scam or identity theft, it’s likely going to leave a record in your statements or payment and banking apps. If you spot something fishy there, follow up and report it.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lastly, you can always ask yourself, “Do I really need this app?” One way to avoid malicious mobile apps is to download fewer apps overall. If you’re unsure if that free game is on the up-and-up or if the offer for that productivity app sounds a little </span><i><span data-contrast="none">too</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> good, skip it. Look for a better option or pass on the idea altogether. As said earlier, cybercriminals really rely on us clicking and downloading without thinking. Staying on guard against mobile malware will cost you a few moments of your time, which is minimal compared to the potential costs of a hacked phone. </span></p>

That means it’s time to grab your devices and credit cards for some online <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/holiday-shopping-season-security-tips/">holiday shopping</a>. But while you plan to share the merry and shop for gifts, criminals are preparing some not-so-festive tricks of their own.</p>
<p>Let’s unwrap the top four phishing scams that users should beware of while making online purchases this week and through the rest of the year. Remember, there&#8217;s still time to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html">shop for cybersecurity protection</a> this holiday season.</p>
<h3><strong>Email Phishing: How Cyber-Grinches Steal Your Inbox</strong></h3>
<p>It might surprise you to see that a tactic as old as email phishing is still so widely used today. Well, that’s because many people still fall for email phishing scams, as the criminals behind these attacks up the ante every year to make these threats more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Scammers also tend to take advantage of current events to trick unsuspecting consumers into falling for their tricks. Take earlier this year, for example, when many users received phishing emails claiming to be from a government entity regarding financial support due to the global health emergency. Cybercriminals will likely use similar, timely tactics leading up to the holidays, posing as famous retailers and promising fake discounts in the hope that a consumer will divulge their credit card details or click on a malicious link.</p>
<h3><strong>Spear Phishing Takes Advantage of the Season of Giving</strong></h3>
<p>Like email phishing, spear phishing has been around for quite some time. With spear phishing attacks, hackers pretend to be an organization or individual that you&#8217;re familiar with and include a piece of content—a link, an email attachment, etc.—that they know you&#8217;ll want to interact with. For example, cybercriminals might claim to be charitable organizations asking for donations, knowing that many families like to donate during the holidays. The email might even include the recipient’s personal details to make it seem more convincing. But instead of making a generous contribution, users find that they infected their own system with malware by clicking on the fraudulent link.</p>
<h3><strong>Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vishing?</strong></h3>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not the sound of Santa coming down the chimney – it&#8217;s the sound of voice phishing! &#8220;Vishing&#8221; attacks can be highly deceiving, as hackers will call a user and trick them into giving up their credentials or sharing other personal information. For example, a scammer could call an individual telling them that they won a large amount of cash as part of a holiday contest. Overjoyed with the thought of winning this so-called contest, the user may hand over their bank information to the criminal on the other end of the phone. But instead of receiving a direct deposit, all they find is that their banking credentials were used to make a fraudulent purchase.</p>
<h3><strong>Special Delivery or SMiShing?</strong></h3>
<p>SMS phishing, or “SMiShing,” is another threat users should watch out for this holiday season. This tactic uses misleading text messages claiming to come from a trusted person or organization to trick recipients into taking a certain action that gives the attacker exploitable information or access to their mobile device.</p>
<p>Due to the current global health emergency and the desire to do more digitally, consumers will likely rely on online shopping this holiday season. To take advantage of this trend, scammers will probably send fraudulent text messages disguised as online retailers. These messages will likely contain fake tracking links, shipping notices, and order confirmations. But if an unsuspecting user clicks on one of these links, they will be directed to a fake website prompting them to enter their credentials for the attackers to further exploit.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid Unwanted Security “Presents” This Holiday Season</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>To prevent cybercriminals from messing with the festive spirit via phishing schemes, follow these tips so you can continue to make merry during the holiday shopping season:</p>
<h3><strong>Be cautious of emails asking you to act </strong></h3>
<p>If you receive an email, call, or text asking you to download software or pay a certain amount of money, don’t click on anything or take any direct action from the message. Instead, go straight to the organization’s website. This will prevent you from downloading malicious content from phishing links or forking over money unnecessarily.</p>
<h3><strong>Hover over links to see and verify the URL</strong></h3>
<p>If someone sends you a message with a link, hover over the link without actually clicking on it. This will allow you to see a link preview. If the URL looks suspicious, don’t interact with it and delete the message altogether.</p>
<h3><strong>Go directly to the source</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of clicking on a link in an email or text message, it’s always best to check directly with the source to verify a holiday shopping offer or track a package’s shipment.</p>
<h3><strong>Browse with caution</strong></h3>
<p>Use a comprehensive security solution, like <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html">McAfee Total Protection</a>, which can help protect devices against malware, phishing attacks, and other threats. It includes <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog/mwad_528/mcafee-web-advisor.html">McAfee WebAdvisor</a>, which can help identify malicious websites.</p>

Let’s be honest – it’s been brutal! So many parents had to juggle their own full-time work, running a household, AND supervising a day’s worth of learning for often, multiple children! </span><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/education/the-impossible-juggle-parents-spent-14-hours-a-week-on-home-learning-20211012-p58zdq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Research from Macquarie University</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> showed that many parents spent up to 14 hours a week in their role as home learning managers and 9/10 parents reported the experience as, quite understandably, stressful! As a mum of older teens and young adults – who are usually self-sufficient &#8211; I’m in awe!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But the good news is – things are on the improve! Our vaccine rates are amongst the best in the world, so lockdowns have been lifted and, drum roll… kids are back at school! I’ve always been a big fan of trying to find the silver lining of any situation and I think there are many we can take away from our COVID experience, particularly when it comes to digital parenting. I know of so many parents who have completely rethought their approach to managing kids and technology since the pandemic hit because of their home learning experience.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, in the spirit of sharing and caring, I thought I’d round up some of the best ‘aha’ moments from parents who were forced to become expert home learning managers over multiple lockdowns. And make sure you take notes because there are some great learnings that we can apply to our digital parenting journey. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Embrace Technology</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you have never been ‘all in’ with your kids’ use of technology for both learning and socializing, then you need to get over this ASAP. Technology is the lifeblood of your kids’ lives. It’s how they connect, nurture friendships, and organize their social lives. I also recommend parents try to see technology through the eyes of their kids NOT just through our more ‘mature’ lens. It’s the best way of truly understanding just what a huge role it plays in their day-to-day lives. And don’t forget that technology is almost always used to set up in-person catchups! So, please don’t demonize it, it will only push your kids away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Understanding Your Child’s Online Life is a Powerful Way of Connecting</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I totally appreciate that many parents didn’t choose to be home learning ‘managers’ however many have shared with me how they now feel far more involved in their child’s life because of the experience. Seeing first-hand how your child’s day works, overhearing their conversations with teachers and peers (courtesy of Zoom), and being blown away by your offspring’s tech skills has given many parents incredible insight into their child. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I know of parents who have noticed learning issues and friendship problems all as a result of their home learning manager role! There’s nothing like being able to nip something in the bud before it becomes a big issue! So, stay involved and you’ll reap the rewards!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Get Your Kids Moving &#8211; Encourage Movement and Outdoor Activities Always</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Confession – I have never been one of those parents who proactively organized park visits, bushwalks, and exercise regimes for my kids. But many of the parents who managed young children through a lockdown and resorted to becoming personal trainers reported that it paid dividends. So, now lockdowns are (hopefully!) history, don’t forget about the benefits of getting your kids to move. It’s hard to be on a screen when you are walking the dog, playing a game of family cricket, or bushwalking. I know it’s time-consuming but it’s so worth it! </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Take Some Time to Understand &amp; Protect Your Kids’ Devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As of 2 years ago, </span><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/the-average-aussie-home-has-27-connected-devices-here-s-why-that-s-growing-20181012-p509bw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the average Aussie household had 17 internet-connected devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in tow so it’s no wonder keeping abreast of all the devices in your household feels like a full-time job! But with kids continuing to use their devices for both study and socializing, it’s essential that you give each device a ‘once over’ to minimize risks and prevent issues arising down the track. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ensuring all their software is up to date is a great place to start. Also check that the default password has been changed and that there is some top-shelf security software installed to protect the device and, most importantly, its user! And while you are there, why not also ensure that each of their online accounts has its own distinct password? If you think they could manage a password manager, then it might be time to introduce them to one? Check out McAfee’s </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> – I couldn’t manage without it!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I think you’d be hard-pressed to find many parents keen to return to home learning. In fact, I think there may even be a revolt if we had to go back! But, knowing we have picked up some ‘nuggets of gold’ along the way makes it a little feel a little better! So, please embrace technology – it’s a fantastic way of connecting with your kids. But of course, keep your family’s usage in check and minimize the risks by giving each device a once-over. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Happy Digital Parenting!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

You see a headline stating that one of your favorite online retailers was breached and that thousands of their customers’ passwords were exposed. Data breaches like this frequently appear in the news, but many consumers don’t realize the implications these breaches have on their personal privacy. When data breaches occur, oftentimes billions of these hacked login credentials become available on the dark web, neatly packaged for criminals to download.</span><span data-contrast="none">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:60,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Let’s dive into the differences between the deep web and the dark web, how cybercriminals use the dark web, and what you can do to protect your data. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:60,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Deep Web vs. Dark Web: What’s the Difference? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:60,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You’ve probably heard of the deep and dark web but may not be aware of their differences.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> First, let’s start by noting that the dark web is always part of the deep web, but the deep web is not always the dark web. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The deep web refers to the pages on the internet that are not indexed in search engines, meaning that you can’t find them by performing a simple Google search. To access these pages, you have to know the exact address to the site and access it with specific software. Most personalized and password-protected sites appear on the deep web because they contain information that is not meant to be accessed by the general public. These sites include a user’s Netflix home page, password-protected sites for banking, and the internal sites of companies, organizations, and schools. These are all examples of legitimate areas of the deep web. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the other hand, the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-rise-of-the-dark-web-gig-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">dark web</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is the disreputable extension of the deep web. Like the deep web, the dark web also houses sites that are not indexed by search engines, but it also hides a user’s identity and location. It consists mostly of illegal products or content that could be harmful to organizations or the general public. Some examples include stolen credit card numbers, fake IDs, drugs, and hacking tools. To access the dark web, a user needs to download darknet software, the most popular being Tor. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Tor, which stands for “the onion routing project,” was developed by the U.S. Navy for the government in the mid-1990s. It was open-sourced in 2004, and that’s when it went public. Today, Tor is the dark web browser that the majority of people use to surf the internet anonymously. To do this, Tor hides a user’s IP address (or the unique address that identifies an internet-connected device or network) by bouncing their search request to multiple different locations. These bounces also referred to as relays, make it much harder for people to find users on the dark web. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Cybercriminals Use the Dark Web</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because of its ability to provide anonymity, the dark web is often tied to the world of cybercrime. Scammers frequently use the dark web to find software that allows them to access other people’s computers, banking credentials, Social Insurance Numbers, and credit card information. You may be wondering how all this private information ended up on the dark web in the first place. Oftentimes when a company is breached and their customers’ data is exposed, the hackers behind the breach will upload the stolen database to the dark web. This allows other cybercriminals to purchase the stolen information and use it to target users with other scams. Say that a criminal finds a database on the dark web that contains a bunch of personal email addresses. They can purchase the database and target every email address with a phishing campaign that contains malicious links that spread malware or attempt to trick users into handing over their username and password combinations. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Protect Your Data</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Incorporating cybersecurity best practices into your daily life can help protect your data from hackers looking to take advantage of the data found on the dark web. Follow these tips to bring yourself greater peace of mind: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Use strong, unique passwords </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The chances of a hacker accessing your data are higher if you use the same credentials across different accounts. That’s why it’s important to use a strong, unique password for each of your online profiles. This minimizes the potential damage that could be done if a hacker does gain access to one of your accounts. You can also use a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/why-do-i-need-a-password-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> with a built-in generator to make it easier for you to access and manage passwords. Enabling multi-factor authentication will also ensure that hackers cannot access your information using only your login credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Be on the lookout for suspicious emails and text messages</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you receive an email asking you to take immediate action, stop and think. Criminals often convey urgency in their phishing scams in the hopes that an unsuspecting user will click on a malicious link or hand over their personal details without considering the legitimacy of the message. Examine suspicious emails carefully to check for </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">telltale signs of phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, such as poor grammar, grainy logos, or bogus links. If an email claims to be from a well-known company or brand and asks for your credentials, claims that you need to update your password, or sends you a “free offer,” go directly to the source. Contact customer service through the company’s website (not the email) and inquire about the urgent request. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">How do you connect online these days? I’ll give you an example from my own life: From my 15-year old son to my 80-year-old mother, not one of us leaves the house without our phone. And today, there isn&#8217;t a single thing you can&#8217;t do on your phone. It&#8217;s the minicomputer that goes where you go.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This trend in the way we connect is reflected in recent data too. In fact, we’ve found that the average consumer spends </span><a href="https://wearesocial.com/digital-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">6 hours and 55 min online</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> per day, split between mobile (52%) and desktop (48%). Whether you’re a Boomer, Gen X, a Millennial, or Gen Z, the way you connect online is diverse and specific to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As for what we&#8217;re doing online? It’s just about everything. After all, we spend an average of 7 hours per day on connected devices and the pandemic has forced us to do even more online. The downside to this rapid change in the way we live is that we are opening ourselves up to more risk which leaves consumers feeling highly concerned about their ability to keep their personal info secure or private. We need new protection for this new normal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">For the new normal, a new approach to protection with mobile security</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What all these changes mean is that you’re able to have the same online experience regardless of where you are, what you’re doing, or what device you’re using. Your favorite streaming service is a great example – you can just as easily find a movie on a tablet as you can on your laptop. In fact, you can pause the movie you’re watching on that tablet and pick up where you left off on your laptop. Your experience with online security should offer the same convenience and familiarity. More importantly, online protection should give you a feeling of confidence however or wherever you choose to connect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"> This means knowing your personal info is secure even when accessing an unsecured network, your browsing habits remain private, and you can take necessary actions should your information be compromised. To put it another way, YOU are what we’re focused on protecting and we do that by making sure everything you connect with is also secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Introducing the new McAfee Security mobile app</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A phone is the remote control for your life. From the palm of your hand, you’re able to shop, browse, stream, and create &#8211; everything you do online you can now do from your phone. So, it’s crucial that your phone be a major focus of our online protection. The new mobile app makes it easier to get robust protection for your identity, privacy, and phone. Let’s look at a few of the capabilities offered by the new mobile app.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Identity Protection Service</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Think about all the online accounts you’ve created in the past year. How many of them do you use regularly? Sometimes I think I have more food delivery apps on my phone than I do restaurants to use them on. Regardless of how often you use an account (or if you no longer use it at all!), any personal information (like emails, addresses, credit cards) added to it is available online and vulnerable to breaches. McAfee Security comes with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/identity-protection-service-the-best-solution-to-a-growing-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity protection</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a feature that monitors your personal information and then notifies you when there’s a risk of your data being compromised. What this means is that if we detect that your data was stolen, you&#8217;ll be alerted an average of 10 months earlier than similar services, so you can act </span><i><span data-contrast="none">before</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> your data is used illegally or shows up on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Let’s say you’re about to use the free internet at your favorite café for a speedier connection. Time to flip on your virtual private network (VPN). Forget about digging through a sea of menus to find your VPN. The new mobile app offers a seamless VPN experience so you can keep your activity hidden on less-than-secure Wi-Fi. Or, better yet, you can set up a Secure VPN to automatically turn on for unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Whatever you choose, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/private-browsing-vs-vpn-which-one-is-more-private/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Secure VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> keeps your personal data and location private anywhere you go with unlimited data and bank-grade Wi-Fi encryption.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">At the end of the day, phones are devices and they’re vulnerable to viruses, malware, and, increasingly, malicious apps. The new McAfee Mobile app offers an antivirus scan for Android phones and system scans to see if your passcode is strong enough and that your OS is up to date on iOS devices.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">If you’re an existing McAfee subscriber using McAfee Total Protection or McAfee LiveSafe, you can get the app right now.

You’ve never left your wallet in a taxi or lost an expensive ring down the drain. You never let your smartphone out of your sight, yet one day you notice it’s acting oddly. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Did you know that your device can fall into cybercriminals’ hands without ever leaving yours? SIM swapping is a method that allows criminals to take control of your smartphone and break into your online accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Don’t worry: there are a few easy steps you can take to safeguard your smartphone from prying eyes and get back to using your devices confidently.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What Is a SIM Card?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">First off, what exactly is a SIM card? SIM stands for subscriber identity module, and it is a memory chip that makes your phone truly yours. It stores your phone plan and phone number, as well as all your photos, texts, contacts, and apps. In most cases, you can pop your SIM card out of an old phone and into a new one to transfer your photos, apps, etc.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Unlike what the name suggests, SIM swapping doesn’t require a cybercriminal to get access to your physical phone and steal your SIM card. SIM swapping can happen remotely. A cybercriminal, with a few important details about your life in hand, can answer security questions correctly, impersonate you, and convince your mobile carrier to reassign your phone number to a new SIM card. At that point, the criminal can get access to your phone’s data and start changing your account passwords to lock you out of your online banking profile, email, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The most glaring sign that your phone number was reassigned to a new SIM card is that your current phone no longer connects to the cell network.

Since most people use their smartphones every day, you’ll likely find out quickly that your phone isn’t functioning as it should. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, when a SIM card is no longer active, the carrier will often send a notification text.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">To be frank, just about everyone should be at least raising an eyebrow at this one.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is where things get tricky. DNS extensions that were standardized over two decades ago, such as DNSSEC and DNS cookies, should successfully mitigate this and all other DNS cache poisoning attack side channels. The unfortunate reality is that these features see very limited adoption due to backwards-compatibility concerns. While we wait for these dinosaurs holding back progress to die out, the authors of the aforementioned whitepaper have suggested some alternative mitigations, including </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">enabling the IP_PMTUDISC_OMIT socket option</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">, introducing additional randomization to the structure of the DNS exception cache, and configuring DNS servers with a singular default gateway to outright </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">reject ICMP redirects</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Blacksmith, a name referring to both the vulnerability and the fuzzer created to exercise it, is a new implementation of the <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf">Rowhammer</a> DRAM hardware vulnerability from 2014. The crux of Rowhammer is the use of high frequency read operations to induce bit flips in neighboring regions of physical memory, which can lead to the crossing of any security barrier if the attacker can massage memory so that critical data is stored in a vulnerable physical page. Modern DRAM hardware uses a technology called Target Row Refresh (TRR) to prematurely refresh regions of physical memory targeted by common Rowhammer attacks. Researchers at ETH Zurich and their associates discovered that TRR exploits the uniform nature of memory accesses used by existing Rowhammer attacks to “catch” them, and so devised a Rowhammer attack that used non-uniform accesses, arriving at CVE-2021-42114, which </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">bypasses TRR and all other modern Rowhammer mitigations</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

And yet that is the precise position where most find themselves today while trying to battle cybersecurity issues across their supply chain. While these supply chains have plenty of their own challenges, such as global disruptions of distribution, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/tis-the-season-for-holiday-cyber-threats-targeting-enterprises-in-a-pandemic-world/">our recent research</a> shows that it’s the cybersecurity problems that will long survive for the long term.</p>
<p>It’s not as though enterprises rely on their partners any more today than they did ten years ago. Their needs have not changed and are unlikely to change, except those rare instances where an enterprise will choose to manufacture their own supplies rather than rely on partners. Consider, for example, <a href="https://www.mashed.com/314771/how-costcos-enormous-chicken-farm-has-changed-nebraska/">Costco creating its own gigantic chicken farm</a>. Other than outlier examples like this, partner reliance is relatively stable.</p>
<p>What is changing with the supply chain is how much system access is being granted to these partners. They are getting access they didn’t always get and are getting far deeper access as well. As technology has advanced to allow such access, enterprises have accepted.</p>
<p>Given the wide range of partners&#8211;suppliers, distributors, contractors, outsourced sales, cloud platforms, geographical specialists, and sometimes your own largest customers&#8211;the cybersecurity complexities are growing by orders of magnitude. In addition, the more integrations that enterprises accept, the higher the level that their risk is. To be more precise, the risk doesn’t necessarily grow with the number of partners as much as the risk grows with the number of partners whose cybersecurity environments are less secure than the enterprise’s own environment.</p>
<p>To even begin to craft a cybersecurity strategy to manage partners and a global supply chain, the enterprise CISO needs to have a candid understanding of what their partners’ security level truly is. That is tricky, given that many of those partners themselves do not have a good sense of how secure or insecure they are.</p>
<p>One suggestion is to revise contracts to make it a requirement for all partners to maintain a security level equal to the enterprise customer. The contract must not only specify penalties for non-compliance&#8211;and those penalties must be sufficiently costly that it makes no sense for a partner to take that chance&#8211;but it must specify means to determine and re-verify that security level. Surprise inspections and the sharing of extensive log files would be a start.</p>
<p>Otherwise, even the strictest security environment such as Zero Trust may be unable to plug supply chain holes due to sloppier partner security practices. Let’s say that a large enterprise retailer is working with a large consumer goods manufacturer as a partner. A good environment will start with strict authentication, making sure that the user from the partner is really that authorized user. The enterprise environment must also watch the user throughout the session to make sure the user doesn’t do anything suspicious. But if the partner has been breached, malware could sneak in through the secure tunnel and, if it’s not caught by the enterprise, there’s a problem and now they can be breached.</p>
<p>This is not hypothetical. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our research found that a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/tis-the-season-for-holiday-cyber-threats-targeting-enterprises-in-a-pandemic-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of global enterprises</a> (81 percent) said that they are seeing far more attacks since the beginning of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Almost every business is dependent on the supply chain, making it a prime target for cybercriminals looking to cause disruption and breach wider networks. As the holiday season approaches, we are already seeing a spike in consumer and business activity across the supply chain, making it a prime target for cybercriminals looking to target essential and lucrative services.</p>
<p>Attackers are going to continue to leverage the global supply chain as an initial entry vector, accessing the network through a trusted connection, system, or user. The fact that these attacks exploit trusted channels makes them very difficult to prevent or detect. As organisations continue their digital transformation, including ever-more cloud services, managed services and endpoint modernization, the risks of supply chain threats will increase as its prevalence as a vector does so.</p>

Other times it&#8217;s a quiz that will magically reveal your celebrity look-alike. While the innocent click connected to most clickbait is seemingly harmless, some clickbait can install dangerous malware onto your devices.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the FBI’s Crime Complaint Center&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">2020 Internet Crime Report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, internet crime increased by 300,000 complaints from 2019 to 2020.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some clickbait scams exploit current events and the cultural climate, according to the </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21382-watch-out-for-click-bait-scams-following-a-tragedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Better Business Bureau</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The scam-tracking organization warns consumers to be wary of any news items, links, and popups that require you to give personal information. Depending on the scam&#8217;s goal, the wrong click can result in a slew of email or text spam, malicious data mining, or even a monthly charge on your phone bill. And the hidden hook? Clickbait appears to be harmless at first glance, so we often share it with friends without understanding the entire risk. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Critical Thinking vs. Impulse </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Clickbait relies on behavioral science. Bad actors online know that people are naturally curious. They want to understand, close their knowledge gaps, and be entertained. A popular </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/12/psychology-of-clickbait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">article in </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Wired</span></i></a><span data-contrast="auto"> attributes our collective affinity for clickbait to the role emotion plays in our daily choices and to our lazy brains. We want instant gratification when filling our knowledge gaps online, cites Wired, which is why we forgo caution and opt for quick clicks we know won&#8217;t deliver on its promise. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to begin changing those habits and to teach our kids to do the same is by encouraging critical thinking and strengthening our digital literacy skills. Critical thinking is more than just pausing before you click. It&#8217;s understanding the environment. Critical thinking is using websites and apps with a keen eye toward the goals, motivations, and agendas of the content provider. It’s asking questions suchy as: </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Where will this link take me? What&#8217;s this app or link&#8217;s goal? Do I know the person who sent me this link? What is this person, app, or website asking me to do?

They will exploit political division or a global tragedy and capitalize on fear by planting clickbait that is almost impossible to ignore without clicking. This tactic makes people feel emotionally compelled to share the story with others, which only increases the scam’s destruction. Look for spelling errors, poorly designed websites, and misspelled web addresses.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If something doesn&#8217;t look right, but you&#8217;re curious about the information in the headline, stop and do your research before sharing. Go to a reliable news site to verify the information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are bad actors, digital distractions, and cyber traps around every corner online. However, deciding to be intentional with your family&#8217;s online safety will render long-term habits that will shut out the bad actors online, making more room for the good stuff we all enjoy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social engineering attacks unfold much like a confidence scam. A crook takes advantage of someone’s trust, applies a little human psychology to further fool the victim, and then pulls off a theft. Online, a social engineering attack will likely involve a theft attempt of personal or account information that the crook can then use to make purchases, drain accounts, and so forth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Not at all in the holiday spirit, right? Let’s take a look at some of their top tricks so that you can spot and avoid them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As said, spirits can get high this time of year. There’s looking forward to gatherings with family and friends, the fun that comes along with hunting for that perfect gift, and the excitement of the holidays overall. And that’s what hackers count on—people getting caught up in the rush of the holidays, to the point where they may not look at emails, offers, shipping notices, and such with a critical eye. That’s how the scammers get their foot in the door.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some of their favored tricks can look a little like this:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Special access to hard-to-get holiday gifts.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What are the holidays without that trendy “must-get” gift item, the one that’s seemingly out of stock no matter where you look? Scammers are keen on these items as well and will prop up phony ads and storefronts that pretend to sell those items but really don’t. Instead, they’re just a shady way for them to steal your debit or credit card information—or to lift a few bucks out of your pocket in return for nothing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to keep from getting burned by one of these scams is to follow the old adage, “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.” In this case, crooks are using feelings of scarcity and urgency to get you to bite. Here’s where you can take a moment before you click to do some research. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">How long has the company been around? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Are there reviews of this company? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Do you have friends who’ve shopped with them before (and had a good experience)? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">What is their listing with the Better Business Bureau (and do they even have a listing)?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Answers to these questions can separate the good businesses from the bogus ones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Gift card and coupon scams.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like the above, crooks will create a sense of urgency about a hot holiday item or limited time offer. The twist comes when they request payment via a gift card rather than by credit or debit card or other legitimate online payment methods. This request is highly deliberate because gift cards are much like cash. Once the money on the card is spent, it’s gone, and these cards do not offer the same protections that come with other payment methods.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can avoid this one easily. If anyone asks you to use a gift card as payment, it’s a scam. </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/gift-card-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Gift cards are for gifts, not payment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, says the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If you come across such a scam, you can report it to the FTC as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Charity scams.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Donating to a charity in someone else’s name is often a popular gift. Much the same, giving a donation to a worthy cause feels particularly good this time of year. Once again, scammers will take advantage of these good intentions by propping up phony charities designed to do nothing more than dupe you out of your money. Whether that’s a flat-out phony charity or one of the many other </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-38-states-dc-act-shut-down-massive-charity-fraud-telefunding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">scam charities that have been known to pocket 90 cents of every dollar donated</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, this is the time of year to be on the lookout for both.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The advice here is much the same as the advice for avoiding phony businesses and retailers. Do your homework. </span><a href="https://give.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The Better Business Bureau maintains a listing of charities that can help you make good donation choices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Also, </span><span data-contrast="none">your state government’s charity officials can help you separate good charities from bad</span><span data-contrast="auto">—and even file a report if you suspect a scam is at play.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And once again, if a charity is asking for donations in the form of cash, gift cards, or wire transfer, just say no. That’s a surefire sign of a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Phony shipping notices.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers know you have packages in transit this holiday season, loaded with gifts that you’re eagerly tracking. Enter another classic scam—the phony shipping notice. The idea is that you already have so many packages on their way that you won’t think twice about opening an email with a “shipping notice” that comes in the form of an attachment. Of course, that attachment is a fake. And it’s loaded with malware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Too bad for scammers, though. This is another one you can steer clear of rather easily. Don’t open such attachments. Shipping companies will almost certainly send along notices and invoices in the body of an email, not as an attachment. If you have a question, you can always visit the shipper’s website and look up your tracking info there. Likewise, follow up with the customer service department of the company that you purchased the item from in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Yet more ways you can protect yourself from holiday scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While the holidays are a special time for scammers too, there are several things you can do to up the level of your protection now and year ‘round. A quick list includes:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Secure your devices and set your email spam filters.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">If you haven’t already, secure your devices with comprehensive online protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. With that in place, it can prevent you from mistakenly clicking risky links and downloads, blot out spam emails before they reach your inbox, and protect your accounts with strong, unique passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect your identity too.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Another thing that comprehensive online protection should cover is you. With </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, you can protect yourself.

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Beware of downloads you aren’t expecting.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> This is always good form because hackers love to spike downloads with malware designed to steal your personal information. Whether you get an unexpected attachment from a friend or business, follow up with them before opening it. If they say they didn’t send it, that’s a quick way to find out whether the attachment is legitimate or not.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep an eye out for typos and poorly crafted messages.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Scammers may know a thing or two about human nature, but that doesn’t mean that they’re the best writers, designers, and website developers. A common sign of a scam is an email, ad, message, or site that simply doesn’t look or read right. Granted, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">some scammers have gotten quite good at making their scams look legitimate, yet many still fail to clear that bar</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep the good feeling going this holiday season</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No doubt, the holidays have a feel all to themselves, one which hackers and crooks want to take advantage of. They’ll craft their tricks accordingly and try to twist the good times that roll around at the end of the year into scams that capitalize on your good intentions. As you can see, it’s not too tough to spot them for what they are if you pause and take a moment to scrutinize those emails, offers, and sales. And that’s the thing with the holidays. We can all feel pinched for time at some point or other during this stretch. Look out for their pressure tactics and seemingly clever ways of using social engineering to rip you off. That way, you can spend the holidays focusing on what’s important—your friends and family.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>‘Tis the season for scams. Well, honestly, it’s always scam season somewhere. In 2020, the Internet Crime and Complaint Center (<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IC3</a>) reported losses in excess of $4.1 billion dollars in scams which was a 69% increase over 2019. There is no better time for a scammer celebration than Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the lead-up to Christmas and New Year. It’s a predictable time of the year, which gives scammers ample time to plan and organize. The recipe isn’t complicated, at the base we have some holiday excitement, sprinkle in fake shopping deals and add some discounts, and ho ho ho we have social engineering scams.</p>
<p>In this blog, we want to increase awareness related to scams as we expect elevated activity during this holiday season. The techniques used to scam folks are very similar to those used to spread malware too, so always be alert and use caution when browsing and shopping online. We will provide some examples to help educate consumers on how to identify scams. The victims of such scams can be others around you like your kids or parents, so read up and spread the word with family and friends. Awareness, education, and being alert are key to keeping you at bay from fraudsters.</p>
<h2>Relevant scams this season</h2>
<p>Although there is a myriad of scams out there, we expect the most common scams and targets this season to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-delivery scams – Fake online stores will attempt to get you to purchase items that you will never end up receiving</li>
<li>Deals that get shoppers excited. Supply chain issues recently will give scammers more fodder. Scammers can place bait deals on popular items</li>
<li>Elderly parents/grandparents looking for cheap medical equipment, medical memberships, or looking to purchase and ship their grandchildren presents for the holidays.</li>
<li>Emotionally vulnerable people might fall prey to romance scams</li>
<li>Children looking for free, Fortnite Vbucks and other gaming credits may fall prey to scams and could even get infected with potentially unwanted programs</li>
<li>Charity scams will be rampant.</li>
</ol>
<p>SMSishing, email-based Phishing, and push notifications will be the most common vectors initiating scams during this holiday season. Here are some common tactics in use today:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Unbelievable deals or discounts</strong></h3>
<p>This is a common theme around this time of the year. Deals, discounts, and gift cards can be costly to your bank account. Be wary of URLs being presented to you over email or SMS. Phishing emails, bulk mailing, texting, and typo-squatting are some of the ways that scammers target their prey.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Creating a sense of urgency</strong></h3>
<p>Scammers will create a sense of urgency by telling you that you have limited time to claim the deal or that there is low inventory for popular items in their store. It’s not difficult for scammers to identify sought-after electronics items or holiday gifts for sale and offer them for sale on their fake stores. Such scams are believable given the supply chain challenges and delivery shortages over the last few months.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Utilizing Scare tactics </strong></h3>
<p>Getting people worried about a life-changing event or disrupting travel plans can be concerning. So, if you get an unexpected call from someone claiming to be from the FBI, police, IRS, or even a travel company, stop and think. They may be using scare tactics to dupe you. Never divulge personal information and if in doubt, ask them a lot of directed questions and fact check them. As an example, check to see if they know your home address, account number, itinerary number, or bank balance depending on who they claim to be. Scammers typically don’t have specific details and when put on the spot, they’ll hang up.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Emotional tactics </strong></h3>
<p>Like scare tactics, scammers may prey on vulnerable people. Although there can be many variations of such scams, the more common ones are <em>Romance Scams</em> where you end up connecting to someone with a fake profile, and <em>Fake Charity Scams</em> where you receive a phone call or an email requesting a donation. Do not entertain such requests over the phone especially if you receive a phone call soliciting a donation. During the conversation, they will attempt to make you feel guilty or selfish for not contributing enough. Remember, there is no rush to donate. Go to a reputable website or a known organization and donate if you must after due diligence.</p>
<h2>Tips to identify a scam</h2>
<p>Successful scams are situationally accurate. You may be the smartest guy in the room, but when you eagerly waiting for that delivery and you see an email update claiming a delivery delay from UPS, you might fall for a scam. This is particularly true in the holiday season and therefore such themes are more prevalent. Here are some tips on how to identify scams early on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be suspicious of anything that is <em>pushed</em> to you from an unknown source &#8211; emails, SMS, advertisements, phone calls, surveys, social media. This is when you are being solicited to do something you might not have otherwise chosen to
<ol>
<li>Avoid going to unknown websites to begin with. You always have the option to r before you click on a link. You can always use some of the following trusted free resources to validate a domain or business
<ol>
<li><a href="https://trustedsource.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://trustedsource.org/</a> &#8211; to look up a URL</li>
<li><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url</a> &#8211; to look up a URL</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bbb.org/</a> &#8211; to validate a business, charity, etc</li>
<li><a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://whois.domaintools.com/</a> &#8211; to look up site history. A new or recent domain is less trustworthy. Scammers register new domains based on the theme of their scams.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you do end up navigating, look for the following to build trust in a link:
<ol>
<li>Ensure it&#8217;s an &#8220;https&#8221; domain versus an “http”. A valid “https” certificate just means that your data is encrypted enroute to the website. Although this method isn’t indicative of a scam, some scams are hosted on compromised “http” sites. (example 1))</li>
<li>Closely look at the domain name. They might be indicative of fakes. Scammers would typically register domains with very similar names to deceive you. For example, Amazon.com could be replaced by Arnazon.com or AMAZ0N.com. &#8216;vv&#8217; could be replaced for &#8216;w&#8217;, &#8216;I&#8217; for a 1, etc. Same goes for emails you receive – take a close look</li>
<li>Another common way of reaching a fake website is due to &#8220;typosquatting&#8221; but this is typically human error, where a user may type an incorrect domain name and reach a fake site.</li>
<li>Most legit sites will have a &#8220;Contact us&#8221;, &#8220;About Us&#8221;, &#8220;Conditions of Use&#8221;, &#8220;Privacy Notice&#8221;/&#8221;Terms&#8221;, &#8220;Help&#8221;, Social Media presence on Twitter, FB, Instagram, etc. Read up on the pages to learn about the website and even look for website reviews before you make a purchase. Fake websites do not invest a lot of time to populate these – this could be a giveaway.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Always confirm the sender of and email or text by validating the email address or phone number. For example, if an email claims to be from BankOfAmerica, you would expect their email domain in most cases to be from “@bankofamerica.com” and not from “@gmail.com”. Avoid clicking on links from emails or messages when you don’t know the sender.</li>
<li>If you end up linking to a page because of an email or message, never provide personal details. Any site asking for such information should raise red flags. Even if the site looks legit, Phishing scammers make exact replicas of web pages and try to get you to login. This allows them to steal your login credentials. (Example 4)</li>
<li>Don’t feel pressured to click on a link or provide details to solicitors in such cases especially. Any attempt to gather personal data is a big NO.</li>
<li>Never open attachments from unknown people. Emails with document attachments or PDF Attachments are very popular in spreading malware. The attachment names are typically very enticing to click on. Names like “invoice.pdf”, “receipt.doc”, “Covid-19 test results.doc”, etc. may invite some curiosity but could also lead to malware.</li>
<li>Ensure you review the hyperlink before you click them. It’s easy to fake the text and get you to an illegit page (Example 2)</li>
<li>Anyone who insists on payments using a pre-paid gift card or wire transfer, instead of your typical credit card is most likely attempting to scam you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>The end goal of a scammer is that they want to make money &#8211; so be alert with your cards and their activity.
<ol>
<li>Avoid using Debit Cards online. Use a prepaid or virtual Credit Card or even better utilize Apple Pay, Google Pay or PayPal for online payments. Payment card services today have advanced fraud monitoring systems</li>
<li>Check CC statements often to look for any unanticipated charges.</li>
<li>If you make a purchase, ensure you have a tracking number and monitor shipments</li>
<li>Disable international purchases if you know you won’t be traveling.</li>
<li>Never wire money directly to anyone you do not know.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>What if you are a victim?</h2>
<p>If you believe that you have been a victim of a scam, here are a few tips that might help.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, get in touch with your Credit Card company and tell them to put a hold on your card. You can dispute any suspicious charges and request an issue of a chargeback</li>
<li>If you have been scammed through popular sites like ebay.com or amazon.com &#8211; contact them directly. If you wired money, contact the wire company directly</li>
<li>File a Police Report. If you gave your personal information away, you might want to go to

<h2>Example scams:</h2>
<h3>Example 1: Fake SMS messages</h3>
<p>It’s become more common recently to receive text messages for scammers. The following few text messages demonstrate SMSishing attempts.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is an attempt to gather Bank Of America details. For the scammer, it’s a shot in the dark. Given, the target is a US number, he attempts to use the phone number that he is sending the text to, as a bank account number and provides a link to a bit.ly page (a URL shortening service) to link to a fake page that poses as a Bank of America login. A successful SMSish would be if the victim entered their details.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2. The following are fake texts that attempt to entice you click the link. The bait is the Gift card. One can tell that they are a similar theme since they originate from fake phone numbers, which are very similar but not exact. The domain names of the two URLs are totally random (probably compromised URLs). You can tell that back in October, the full URL based SMShing attempts were not very effective which is why in Nov, they probably used keywords like “COSTCO” and “ebay” within the URL and inline to their SMS context, to make it more likely for people to click.</p>
<p>Also note that some of the URLs only have an “http” versus a “https”, something we had noted earlier in the blog.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Fake email link</h3>
<p>One cannot trust an email by the text. You should review the link to ensure it takes you to where it claims to. The following is an example email where the link is not what it claims to be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132094" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fake-email.png" alt="" width="624" height="292" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fake-email.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fake-email-300x140.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fake-email-205x96.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<h3>Example 3: Fake Store Scam hosted on Shopify</h3>
<p>Shopify is a Canadian multinational e-commerce company. It offers online retailers a suite of services, including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools.</p>
<p>So, where there is money to be made, individuals are looking to take advantage. Shopify scam targets both consumers and business owners. Scammer abuse the power of e-commerce to earn money by implementing fake stores. They observe the product or category, create an attractive logo or image and promote extensively on social media.</p>

<h3>Example 4: Social Engineering to Steal Credentials</h3>
<p>The goal of this scam is to steal credentials however it could as well be used as a malware delivery mechanism. The screenshot is that of a fake business proposal hosted on OneDrive Cloud for phishing purposes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132133" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1.png" alt="" width="1360" height="619" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1.png 1360w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1-300x137.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1-1024x466.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1-768x350.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-1-205x93.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" /></p>
<p>The actor aims to mislead the user into clicking on the above reference link. When the user clicks on the link, it redirects to a different website that displays the below fake OneDrive screenshot.</p>
<p>hxxps://aidaccounts[.]com/11/verified/22/</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-132136" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive-1024x529.png" alt="" width="1024" height="529" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive-1024x529.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive-300x155.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive-768x397.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive-205x106.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/one-drive.png 1353w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>If a user enters their OneDrive details, the actors receive them at their backend. This means that this victim has lost their login credentials to the phishing actors. Look at the address bar and trust your instincts. This is in no way related to Microsoft OneDrive. There are other such examples where they do some additional plumbing of the URL to include keywords that make it more believable – as they did in the SMSishing example above.</p>
<h3>Example 5: Fake Push Notification for surveys</h3>
<p>The goal here is to get the user to accept push notifications. Doing so makes the customer susceptible to other possible scams. In this example, the scammers attempt to get users to fill out surveys. Legit companies online pay users for surveys. A referral code is used to pay the survey taker. The scammer in this case attempts to get others to fill the survey on their behalf and therefore makes money when such surveys use the scammer&#8217;s referral code. Push notifications are used to get the victims to fill out surveys. Previous blogs from McAfee demonstrate similar <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/scammers-impersonating-windows-defender-to-push-malicious-windows-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scams</a> and how to prevent such <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/how-to-stop-the-popups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notifications</a></p>
<p>The initial vector comes to the victim via a spam email with a PDF Spam attachment. In this scenario, Gmail was used as the sender.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132148" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-2.png" alt="" width="624" height="264" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-2.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-2-300x127.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/email-2-205x87.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Upon opening the PDF, a fake online <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%27s_Battlegrounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBG</a> (Players Unknown Battleground) credits generator gets opened. In PUBG, Gamers need credits to participate in various online games and so this scam baits them offering free credits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132151" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg1.png" alt="" width="400" height="454" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg1.png 400w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg1-264x300.png 264w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg1-114x129.png 114w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Once the user clicks on the bait URL, it opens a google feed proxy URL.</p>
<p>Malicious websites are destined to be block-listed and therefore have short shelf lives. Google’s feed proxy redirects them in adapting to new URLs and therefore utilizes a fast-flux mechanism as a technique to keep the campaign alive. Usage of feed proxy are not new and we have highlighted its use in the past by the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/hancitor-making-use-of-cookies-to-prevent-url-scraping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hancitor botnet</a>.</p>
<p>Clicking on the top highlighted URL, it navigates to a webpage that poses as a PUBG Arcane online credit generator.</p>
<p>To make the online generator look real, the website has added fake recent activities highlighting coins users have earned via this generator. Even the add comments section is fake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132154" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg2.png" alt="" width="478" height="567" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg2.png 478w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg2-253x300.png 253w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg2-109x129.png 109w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>Clicking on continue will bring up a fake progress bar. Now the site shows the coins and cash are ready, however, an automated human verification has failed, and a survey has to be taken up for getting the reward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132157" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg3.png" alt="" width="294" height="413" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg3.png 294w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg3-214x300.png 214w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg3-92x129.png 92w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p>A clickable link for this verification is also loaded. Once clicked, a small dialog with 3 options are presented.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132160" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg4.png" alt="" width="614" height="747" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg4.png 614w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg4-247x300.png 247w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pubg4-106x129.png 106w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p>Clicking on “want to become a millionaire” loaded a survey page and prompts you to take it up. It will also prompt you to allow push notifications from this website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132163" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/create-text.png" alt="" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/create-text.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/create-text-300x169.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/create-text-205x115.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Once you click on “Allow”, notifications to take up a survey or fake personalized offer notifications start popping up. Be it on your desktop or on your mobile, these notifications pop-ups to take up more surveys.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132166" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chrome-offer.png" alt="" width="255" height="145" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chrome-offer.png 255w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chrome-offer-205x117.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></p>
<p>Clicking on the other links too from “Human Verification”, you will realize that you have finally ended up not gaining anything for your PUBG Arcane gaming, but ended up taking surveys.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a PDF theme we have seen as a lure on the Lenovo tablet offer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-132169 size-medium" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-300x153.png" alt="" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-300x153.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-768x391.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download-205x104.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/download.png 915w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Clicking on this link takes the user to a page that claims it has been protected by a technique to block bots. Persuading you to click on the allow button for enabling popups.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132172" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/click-allow.png" alt="" width="506" height="329" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/click-allow.png 506w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/click-allow-300x195.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/click-allow-198x129.png 198w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>
<p>Once you click on the enable button, it then redirects the browser to take up a random survey. In our case, the survey was on household income.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132175" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/household-income.png" alt="" width="506" height="357" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/household-income.png 506w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/household-income-300x212.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/household-income-183x129.png 183w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>
<p>Another such theme that we observed was around the latest Netflix series – Squid games. Although Series 1 has currently been released, the fake email prompts early access to Season 2.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132178" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squid-game.png" alt="" width="850" height="707" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squid-game.png 850w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squid-game-300x250.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squid-game-768x639.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squid-game-155x129.png 155w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Scammers spend a lot of time and effort tweaking and tuning their schemes to make it fit just right for you. Avoiding a scam is not full proof but being vigilant is key. Don’t get overly keen when you get offers thrown at you this season. Take a step back, relax and think it through, not only should you do your own research, but you should also trust your instincts. Spending a little extra on products or making donations to a reputable and known organization might be worth the peace of mind during the holidays. Help educate your family and contribute by reporting scams.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

<h2>Threat Summary</h2>
<p>This month it was disclosed that a Microsoft vulnerability that allows for local privilege elevation, previously patched in the November 2021 Patch Tuesday, is still exploitable and was not patched correctly. Using this vulnerability, threat actors with limited access to a compromised device can easily elevate their privileges to help spread laterally within the network.</p>

<h2>Threat Summary</h2>
<p>On November 17, 2021, The US Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) pushed an <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a">Alert</a> entitled &#8220;Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities&#8221; which <strong>you need to pay attention to if you use Microsoft Exchange or Fortinet appliances. </strong>It highlights one Microsoft Exchange CVE (Common Vulnerability &amp; Exposure), three Fortinet CVEs and a list of malicious and legitimate tools associated with this activity.</p>
<h2>Threat Intelligence Update from McAfee Enterprise</h2>
<p>A few hours later our <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/advanced-threat-research.html">Advanced Threat Research (ATR)</a> team published a new campaign in<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/insights-preview.html"> MVISION Insights</a> under the name “<strong>Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities</strong>”. Immediately after, MVISION Insights started to provide near real-time statistics on the prevalence of the tools associated to this threat campaign by country and by sector.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131950" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig1.png" alt="" width="751" height="494" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig1.png 751w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig1-300x197.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig1-196x129.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1. MVISION Insights Global prevalence statistics for this campaign on Nov 19, 2021</em></p>
<p>In this blog I want to show you how you can operationalize the data linked to this alert in MVISION Insights together with your investigation and protection capabilities to better protect your organization against this threat.</p>
<h2>Tracking New Campaigns and Threat Profiles, Including This Alert</h2>
<p>MVISION Insights combines Campaigns and Threat Profiles in the same list, and you can change the order from “Last Detected” to “Last Added” as shown below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131953" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2.png" alt="" width="1377" height="764" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2.png 1377w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2-300x166.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2-1024x568.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2-768x426.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig2-205x114.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2. List of MVISION Insights campaigns last added, with a selection of this campaign</em></p>
<p>On the left of figure 2, a color code shows you the severity assigned by the McAfee ATR team (Medium for this campaign), in the middle you can see whether we have seen detections of the analysed IOCs in your country or in your sector</p>
<p>If you are a McAfee Endpoint Security or IPS customer, on the right of figure 2 you can see whether you have had any detection of these IOCs by your McAfee Endpoint Security or IPS, or whether Endpoint Security has found exposed devices, or devices with insufficient Endpoint Security protection</p>
<p>As shown in figure 2, you can also click the campaign’s preview to read a short description, and the labels given by MVISION Insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>APT</li>
<li>Ransomware</li>
<li>Tool</li>
<li>Vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, you can see that CISA suspects this campaign to be associated with an <u>APT</u> threat group. It includes <u>Ransomware</u> behaviors. The labels also highlight the use of hacking <u>tools</u> and <u>vulnerabilities</u> which you can then view in the Campaign details. Last September we hosted a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/gated-form.html?docID=video-6274600633001&amp;eid=4NQYHJP0">webinar focused on threat intelligence and protection against hacking tools</a>.</p>
<p>The campaign description highlights the usual use of “devices encrypted with the Microsoft Windows BitLocker encryption feature”.</p>
<p>The campaign’s details also provide links to other sources, such as the CISA alert in this case.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-131956 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig3.png" alt="" width="751" height="535" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig3.png 751w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig3-300x214.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig3-181x129.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3. Original CISA Alert used for this campaign</em></p>
<h2>Evaluating the Risk and Whether you Could be Exposed</h2>
<p>Once you have identified campaigns which could potentially hit you, you can evaluate your risk and whether you could be exposed because you could have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Vulnerabilities listed</strong><br />
In figure 4, you can see that in this campaign there is 1 CVE for Microsoft Exchange, and 3 CVEs for Fortinet FortiOS</li>
<li><strong>Exposed devices</strong><br />
In figure 2, there are none</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient Endpoint Security protection</strong><br />
In Figure 2, there are none</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131959" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4.png" alt="" width="1371" height="554" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4.png 1371w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4-300x121.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4-1024x414.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4-768x310.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig4-205x83.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1371px) 100vw, 1371px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4. List of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in this campaign’s details</em></p>
<p>If you are a McAfee Enterprise customer, the MVISION Insights Endpoint Security Posture checks whether you have enabled the necessary Endpoint Security features to have the best level of protection across your estate.</p>
<p>In the example below:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Endpoint Security devices have an insufficient AMcore content to detect all campaigns</li>
<li>The warning sign shows that some devices have been excluded from this assessment by the MVISION Insights administrator</li>
<li>1 Endpoint Security device is missing Real Protect Client and Cloud</li>
<li>1 Endpoint Security device is missing Adaptive Threat Protection (ATP)</li>
<li>1 Endpoint Security device has an unresolved detection for a Medium Severity Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen previously, this lab environment has sufficient protection to detect the “Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities” campaign IOCs. However, to have full Endpoint protection, GTI, On-Access scan, Exploit Prevention, Real Protect and ATP must be enabled.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131962" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5.png" alt="" width="752" height="754" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5.png 752w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-300x300.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-150x150.png 150w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-129x129.png 129w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-24x24.png 24w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-48x48.png 48w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig5-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5. McAfee Endpoint Security Detection across all MVISION Insights campaigns</em></p>
<h2>Hunting for Detections and IOCs in Your Environment</h2>
<p>If you are a McAfee Endpoint Security or IPS customer, the detections related to the campaign’s IOCs are automatically mapped by MVISION Insights as shown in Figure 6.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131965" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6.png" alt="" width="1377" height="731" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6.png 1377w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6-300x159.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6-768x408.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig6-205x109.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6: McAfee Endpoint Security Detection across all MVISION Insights campaigns</em></p>
<p>You can also use your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or SIEM solution to search for the presence of IOCs. As you can see below in Figure 7, we have categorized the IOCs, and in this instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 File Hashes have been analyzed by our Threat Research experts and 3 File Hashes have NOT been fully analyzed at this time</li>
<li>2 File Hashes are dual use, and therefore are non-Deterministic</li>
<li>5 File Hashes are partially unique (2 Malicious and 2 Probable Malicious)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an MVISION EDR customer, you can automatically search for the presence of these IOCs across your estate from MVISION insights</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can export the IOCs and hunt them in your EDR, and SIEM, to examine the evidence of a potential compromise and escalate the case to a level2 or level3 analyst to run a full investigation.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also use the MVISION APIs with a third-party Threat Intelligence Platform such as ThreatQ, ThreatConnect or MISP to orchestrate this threat hunting capability.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131968" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig7.png" alt="" width="750" height="390" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig7.png 750w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig7-300x156.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig7-205x107.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 7: MVISION Insights IOCs for this campaign</em></p>
<p>You can also leverage the new Campaign Connections feature (Figure 8) to check whether these IOCs are also listed in other campaigns or threat profiles. Campaign collection uses graphs to connect all the MVISION campaigns, and threat profile data such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>IOCs</li>
<li>MITRE techniques</li>
<li>MITRE and McAfee Tools</li>
<li>Threat actors and groups</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Prevalent countries and sectors</li>
<li>Detections</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131971" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8.png" alt="" width="1377" height="803" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8.png 1377w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8-300x175.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8-1024x597.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8-768x448.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig8-205x120.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 8: MVISION Insights Campaign connection using the IOCs of this campaign</em></p>
<h2>Hunting TTPs in Your Environment</h2>
<p>Beyond the IOCs, your Threat Analysts can also leverage the MITRE Techniques and Tools related to this campaign and documented in MVISION Insights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131974" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig9.png" alt="" width="751" height="451" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig9.png 751w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig9-300x180.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fig9-205x123.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 9: MITRE Techniques and Tools observed in MVISION Insights for this campaign</em></p>
<p>For example, here you could use MVISION EDR to look for the presence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unusual Scheduled Tasks</li>
<li>Unusual WinRAR archives</li>
<li>Unusual local and domain account usage</li>
<li>Mimikatz behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can quarantine suspected devices before running a full remediation. You can also check that your Endpoint Security solution has credential theft protection capabilities such as <a href="https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/endpoint-security-10.7.x-common-product-guide-windows/page/GUID-E76A09F8-4A07-4AA5-B733-5BC24AC9BB21.html">ENS credential theft protection</a>.</p>
<h2>Vulnerability Management</h2>
<p>If your organization hosts Microsoft Exchange or Fortinet appliances you will need to apply the recommended patching and upgrade recommendations. If you find indicators of compromise you might want to increase the priority of the tickets, asking the Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange administrators to fix these CVEs due to these suspicious activities.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To better assess your risk and exposure against this campaign you should review your current capabilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be informed about the latest relevant CISA alerts and other new campaigns and threat actors</li>
<li>Hunt the IOCs, Tools and Techniques associated</li>
<li>Identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</li>
<li>Review your level of Endpoint Protection against these threats</li>
</ul>
<p>McAfee Enterprise offers Threat Intelligence, and Security Operations workshops to provide customers with best practice recommendations on how to utilize their existing security controls to protect against adversarial and insider threats; please reach out if you would like to schedule a workshop with your organization.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The answer: take a deep breath and jump into action. There are five steps can help you prevent or minimize any damage done by a compromised account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So why do hackers go after email accounts? Fact is, t</span><span data-contrast="none">hat email account of yours is a treasure trove. There’s a good chance it contains years of correspondence with friends and family, along with yet more email from banks, online retailers, doctors, contractors, business contacts, and more. In all, your email packs a high volume of personal info in one place, which makes your email account a top prize for hackers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Let’s take a look at how you can take back control of your email account, along with some things you can do to keep it from getting hacked in the first place. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">You can’t log into your email account:</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This one speaks for itself. You go to check your email and find that your username and password combination has been rejected. You try again, knowing you’re using the right password, and still no luck. There’s a chance that a hacker has gotten a hold of your password, logged in, and then changed the password—thus locking you out and giving them control of your account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">One of your contacts asks, “Did this email really come from you?”</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Hackers often compromise email accounts to spread malware on a large scale. By blasting emails to everyone on your hacked contact list, they can reach dozens, even hundreds, of others with a bogus email that may include an attachment that’s infected with malware. And no doubt about it, some of those emails can look a little odd. They don’t sound or read at all like the person they’re trying to impersonate—you—to the extent that some of your contacts may ask if this email really came from you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On the flip side, this is a good reason to never open attachments you weren’t expecting. Likewise, if you get a somewhat strange email from a friend or business contact, let them know. You may be the first indication they get that their email has been compromised.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Slow and erratic device performance:</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A sluggish device could be a sign of malware in general. The thing with malware is that it tends to act like a system and resource hog, which may cause your device to run slowly, to turn off and on again suddenly, or even run hot. In some cases, the malware is logging keystrokes on your computer or taps on your phone to siphon off things like usernames and passwords so that a hacker can take control of the accounts associated with them—such as your email, not to mention your bank accounts. This makes a strong case for antivirus and antimalware protection that’s automatically kept up to date to protect against the latest threats.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What should I do if my email is hacked?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Change your passwords: </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Change your password for your email account if you can. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Make it a strong, unique password</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—don’t reuse a password from another account. Next, update the passwords for other accounts if you use the same or similar passwords for them. (Hackers count on people using simpler and less unique passwords across their accounts—and on people reusing passwords in general.) </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A password manager that’s included with comprehensive online protection software can do that work for you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Use your email provider’s recovery service, if needed:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case where you’ve been locked out of your account because you think the hacker has changed the password, your email provider should have a webpage dedicated to recovering your account in the event of a lost or stolen password. (For example, </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6294825?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google provides this page for users of Gmail and their other services</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.) This is a good reason to keep your security questions and alternate contact information current with your provider, as this is the primary way to regain control of your account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Reach out to your email contacts:</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned above, a big part of the hacker’s strategy is to get their hooks into your address book and spread malware to others. As quickly as you can, send a message to all your email contacts and let them know that your email has been compromised. And if you’ve done so, let them know that you’ve reset your password so that your account is secure again. Likewise alert them that they shouldn’t open any emails or attachments from you that were sent during the time your account was compromised. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Scan your device for malware and viruses: </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also as mentioned above, there are several ways that a hacker can get a hold of your email account information—one of them by using malware. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">Give your device a thorough virus scan with comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to ensure your device is free from malware. Set up a regular scan to run automatically if you haven’t already. That will help keep things clean in the long run.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) Check your other accounts:</span></b></h3>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Sometimes one bad hack leads to another. If someone has access to your email and all the messages in it, they may have what they need to conduct further attacks. Take a look at your other accounts across banking, finances, social media, and other services you use and keep an eye out for any unusual activity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">The bigger picture: Keep tabs on your identity</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">More broadly speaking, your email account is one of the several pieces that make up the big picture of your online identity. Other important pieces include your online banking accounts, online shopping accounts, and so on. No question about it, these are things you want to keep tabs on.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, check your credit report for any signs of strange activity. Your credit report is a powerful tool for spotting identity theft. And in many cases, it’s free to do so. In the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"><span data-contrast="none">requires the major credit agencies to provide you with a free credit check</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> at least once every 12 months. </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-reports-score/order-credit-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Canada provides this service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://moneyaware.co.uk/2017/05/how-to-get-your-credit-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the UK has options to receive free reports as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, along with several other nations. It’s a great idea to check your credit report, even if you don’t suspect a problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond keeping tabs on your identity, you can protect it as well.</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Online identity protection such as ours can provide around-the-clock monitoring of your email addresses and bank accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> with up to $1M of ID theft insurance in the event your identity gets compromised. Additionally, it can put an identity recovery pro on the case if you need assistance in the wake of an attack or breach. Taking a step like this can help keep your email account safer from attack in the first place—along with many others as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="157" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li-300x157.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li-205x107.jpg 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/increased-protections-Li.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>With the acceleration of cloud migration initiatives—partly arising the need to support a remote workforce during the pandemic and beyond—enterprises are finding that this transformation has introduced new operational complexities and security vulnerabilities. Among these are potential misconfigurations, poorly secured interfaces, Shadow IT (access to unauthorized applications), and an increasing number of connected devices and users. To navigate these challenges, enterprises are relying on managed service providers to monitor and protect their cloud environment.</p>
<p>To better serve its customers and secure its own environments, one global technology provider decided to expand its existing on-premises data loss protection (DLP) and web protection with a comprehensive and robust cloud security strategy based on solutions from the  MVISION<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> portfolio of solutions. Already a long-time user of McAfee Enterprise on-premises solutions, the global technology provider not only secured its internal cloud infrastructure consisting of more than 5,000 endpoints across over 30 locations worldwide, they also applied the same approach to the millions of endpoints they manage for more than 10,000 customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Evolving a Modern Cloud Security Approach</strong></h2>
<p>A primary objective for the global technology provider is securing data in the cloud in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications (Microsoft Office 365, OneDrive, Salesforce, and others) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform).</p>
<p>As a first step in its cloud journey, the global technology provider evaluated a number of cloud access security brokers (CASB) solutions. Ultimately, they decided to implement MVISION Cloud for AWS, Office 365, and Shadow IT. In addition to providing comprehensive visibility into cloud app usage, these solutions help with compliance; data loss prevention (DLP) by monitoring the movement of sensitive and confidential data content traveling to or from the cloud, within the cloud, and cloud to cloud; and detection and remediation of threats primarily through user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA).</p>
<h2><strong>Moving to a Consolidated Cloud Security Fabric</strong></h2>
<p>But the global technology provider didn’t stop there. When we rolled out MVISION Unified Cloud Edge, the global technology provider tested it and enthusiastically adopted it. As defined by Gartner, MVISION Unified Cloud Edge is an industry-leading example of Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), a security framework that brings together network connectivity and security into a single, cloud-delivered solution that supports business transformation, edge computing, and workforce mobility.</p>
<p>The global technology provider has reaped multiple advantages from this implementation across its own internal environment and for its customers.</p>
<h3><strong>Key advantage #1: Management ease and less overhead</strong></h3>
<p>MVISION Unified Cloud Edge combines multiple capabilities under one umbrella: CASB functionality with web proxy and DLP with a single administrative hub,  ePolicy Orchestrator® (ePO<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) for streamlined management.</p>
<p>MVISION Unified Cloud Edge capabilities and the ease of integration with the McAfee Enterprise ecosystem has made life easier for the global technology provider’s team, saving time and resources. Now they can set consistent policies from device to cloud and provide users with accelerated and secure access to the tools they use every day, such as Box, Dropbox, and others. As the information security operations manager points out: “A single management console reduces overhead as does being able to set policies that we can sync and apply to multiple data sources on multiple cloud solutions, without having to recreate rules.”</p>
<h3>
<strong>Key advantage #2: Data protection policies in the cloud</strong></h3>
<p>MVISION Unified Cloud Edge has also enabled the global technology provider to further boost its cloud data protection. For example, it can detect data that is improperly managed and stored. Now the organization can apply their existing on-premises data policies to the cloud. For example, they can prevent certain user behaviors that may put both corporate and customer cloud data at risk. These include copying data to cloud apps or USBs, printing it, taking screen captures, accessing risky websites, and uploading data to unauthorized websites.</p>
<h3><strong>Key advantage #3: Improved control over apps</strong></h3>
<p>To create a more secure internal environment, MVISION Unified Cloud Edge has been invaluable for the global security provider. They have a better handle on the applications that are being used across their company. The solution also provides risk scores for the cloud apps that are being used to help steer users away from Shadow IT and toward using only authorized apps. When employees propose new apps to help them do their jobs better, the IT security team can check the security of these apps against requirements and make any necessary modifications to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>“The Shadow IT CASB automatically blocks all cloud services that are deemed high risk, both at our on-premises Web Gateway and the built-in cloud web gateway manager. So, when users attempt to use an unsanctioned SaaS application, they see a message explaining that the app is not safe,” notes the information security operations manager.</p>
<p>The global technology provider also sells SaaS solutions to its clients. With MVISION Unified Cloud Edge, the global technology provider can protect data on any newly sanctioned SaaS applications at no extra cost.”</p>
<h2><strong>A resounding endorsement</strong></h2>
<p>After a successful experience with McAfee Enterprise overall and specifically with the implementation of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/unified-cloud-edge.html">MVISION Unified Cloud Edg</a>e, the information security operation manager recommends the solution to any organization beginning or in the midst of migrating to the cloud.</p>
<p>“I would advise other companies thinking about their cloud transformation journey to seriously consider MVISION Unified Cloud Edge . . . It has a very user-friendly interface and does so much out of the box,” he asserts. “The level of granularity in policy setting lets you do things you don’t think possible or are much easier to accomplish than you realize. . . I don&#8217;t think any other vendor offers such a complete package.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cloud Security Gateways (CSGs) are one of the hottest and most sought-after technologies in the market today, driven by the adoption of cloud services for business transformation and the acceptance of hybrid workforce policies. CSGs, also commonly known as Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs), are responsible for enforcing security policies to protect cloud-hosted corporate assets from advanced threats, while enabling seamless and secure access to these assets from any location and device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have witnessed an exponential growth in cloud usage in the past two years, primarily driven by remote workforce adoption. Based on the data collected by our research team from millions of connected McAfee Enterprise users across the globe, the overall usage of enterprise cloud services spiked by 50% across all industries, while the collaboration services witnessed an increase of up to 600% in usage. This led to an astonishing 630% increase in external attacks on the cloud accounts. Taking all these factors and trends into consideration, CSGs have become a highly essential element of any organization&#8217;s cloud security strategy, playing the most critical role for enabling data protection, threat prevention and compliance in the cloud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee Enterprise continues to innovate in the cloud security space with a laser-focused strategy towards empowering our customers with the best-in-class cloud security solution. MVISION Cloud, recognized as the industry&#8217;s leading CSG solution, has become a vital part of enterprise security, allowing organizations to safely migrate to the cloud while protecting their “crown jewels” – the data. A huge testament to our cybersecurity vision is the IDC MarketScape Worldwide Cloud Security Gateways 2021 Vendor Assessment (Doc # US48334521, November 2021), and we are proud to announce that McAfee Enterprise has been recognized as a leader in the report.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the report, “McAfee has a strong ecosystem of security solutions, including Secure Web Gateway, CSG, and endpoint security that it can integrate to enable customers in their data loss prevention, User Behavior Analytics, XDR, and threat prevention goals.

<p>By Fred House</p>
<p>2021 is already being touted as one of the worst years on record with respect to the volume of zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in the wild. Some cite this as evidence of better detection by the industry while others credit improved disclosure by victims. Others will simply conclude that as the “upside” grows (e.g., REvil demanding $70M or Zerodium paying $2.5M for exploits) so too will the quantity and quality of players. But the scope of these exploitations, the diversity of targeted applications, and ultimately the consequences to organizations were notable as well. As we look to 2022, we expect these factors to drive an increase in the speed at which organizations respond.</p>
<p>If we look back at the past 12 months, we have seen notable breaches that highlight the need for organizations to improve response times:</p>
<p><strong>ProxyLogon</strong>.<i> </i>When we first learned in 2020 that <a title="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/" contenteditable="false" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/">roughly 17,000 SolarWinds customers were affected</a>, many reacted in shock at the pure scope of the compromise (it should be noted that a small subset of these customers are believed to have been compromised by follow-on activity)<i>. </i>Unfortunately, 2021 brought its own notable increase in volume. Two weeks after Microsoft released a patch for ProxyLogon <a title="https://twitter.com/msftsecresponse/status/1374075310195412992?s=20" contenteditable="false" href="https://twitter.com/msftsecresponse/status/1374075310195412992?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they reported that 30K Exchange servers were still vulnerable</a> (<a title="https://cybernews.com/news/62000-microsoft-exchange-servers-potentially-left-unpatched-weeks-after-software-bugs-were-first-uncovered/" contenteditable="false" href="https://cybernews.com/news/62000-microsoft-exchange-servers-potentially-left-unpatched-weeks-after-software-bugs-were-first-uncovered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less conservative estimates</a> had the number at 60K).</p>
<p><strong>ProxyShell.</strong> ProxyShell, a collection of three separate vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34473 and CVE-2021-34523), was Exchange’s second major event of the year after ProxyLogon. In August, a Black Hat presentation outlining Exchange Server vulnerabilities was followed the next day by the release of an exploit POC, all of which had been patched by Microsoft <em>months</em> earlier in April/May. <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/ProxyShell+how+many+Exchange+servers+are+affected+and+where+are+they/27732/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This analysis of data captured by Shodan</a> one week after the exploit POC was released concluded that over 30K Exchange servers were still vulnerable, noting that the data may have underrepresented the full scope (i.e., Shodan hadn’t had time to scan the full Internet). In summary: patched in the Spring, exploited in the Fall. So, what happened in the interim you ask? The <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-exchange-servers-scanned-for-proxyshell-vulnerability-patch-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Client Access Service</a> were exploited by threat actors who deployed web shells to execute arbitrary code on compromised mobile devices and web browsers.</p>
<p><strong>vCenter Server</strong>. Another notable example occurred in May when VMWare released a patch for a remote code execution vulnerability in vCenter Server. <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/thousands-of-vulnerable-vmware-vcenter-servers-still-publicly-exposed-cve-2021-21985-cve-2021-21986/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This subsequent analysis</a> concluded that over 4,000 systems remained vulnerable one week after the patch was released. Much like Exchange servers, where a typical company will only host a handful of servers, 4,000 vulnerable vCenter servers likely represents thousands of distinct companies.</p>
<p><strong>Kaseya VSA</strong>. One bright spot may in fact be the <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB94660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaseya VSA</a> breach. On July 2, REvil launched an unprecedented (anyone else tired of that word?) ransomware campaign against public facing VSA servers. Within two days the <a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/04/Kaseya-Case-Update-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIVD CSIRT reported that the number of exposed VSA servers had dropped from 2,200 to 140</a>. Some estimates suggested that around 50 MSPs were compromised, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-demand-70-million-liberate-data-held-by-companies-hit-mass-cyberattack-2021-07-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affecting between 800 and 1500 business.</a> While this doesn’t sound like much of a bright spot, patching 94% of the affected systems in two days surely helped reduce the success of REvil copycats.</p>
<p>So, what can we take away from all of this? Well, attackers and security researchers alike will continue to hone their craft until weaponized exploits and POCs are expected within hours of vulnerability disclosure. In turn however, and largely driven by the increased consequences of compromise, we can also expect renewed diligence around asset and patch management. From identifying public facing assets to quickly deploying patches despite potential business disruption, companies will have a renewed focus on reducing their “time to patch.”</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Well, the US government is. Checkout <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binding Operational Directive 22-01</a> published on November 3<sup>rd</sup> which compels all federal agencies to remediate known exploited vulnerabilities in two weeks or sooner “<em>in the case of grave risk to the Federal Enterprise”</em>. It’s no coincidence that CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known exploited vulnerabilities catalog</a>, which catalogues the vulnerabilities that must be remediated, includes every one of our examples above with a two-week remediation deadline. If the US government can do it, you can too!</p>

</strong>In June 2021 the G7 economies urged countries that may harbor criminal ransomware groups to take accountability for tracking them down and disrupting their operations. Let’s review the high severity campaigns and threat profiles added to MVISION Insights recently.</p>
<h3><strong>Threat Profile Conti Ransomware &amp; BazarLoader to Conti Ransomware in 32hrs</strong></h3>
<p>Conti has been one of the top Ransomware groups in 2021, including a new campaign reported in September 2021. As mentioned earlier in this report, the public sector seems to be the sector most affected by Ransomware attacks. McAfee Enterprise provides regular publications on the strategies to defend against ransomware, such as <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/fighting-new-ransomware-techniques-with-mcafees-latest-innovations/">this blog</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-131452 size-medium alignnone" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.03.53-AM-300x248.png" alt="" width="300" height="248" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.03.53-AM-300x248.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.03.53-AM-156x129.png 156w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.03.53-AM.png 622w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Other Recent Threats Affecting the Public Sector</strong></h2>
<p><strong>CVE-2021-40444 Microsoft MSHTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p>This is a serious Microsoft Office vulnerability reported in September 2021 by Microsoft, McAfee Enterprise and other sources. The MVISION Insights heat map shows the prevalence of the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with this threat in the first half of October 2021.</p>
<p>Although Microsoft has provided <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444">guidance</a> on a workaround, it can be challenging for many public sector organizations to deploy these patches quickly. To help you be more agile, McAfee Enterprise has released its own <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-defender-blog-mshtml-cve-2021-40444/">guidance leveraging ENS, EDR and <u>NSP</u></a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office vulnerabilities are commonly exploited in the early phases of the attack lifecycle. BazarLoader, mentioned earlier with the Conti Ransomware, has also been used with Word and Excel documents. In the MITRE Enterprise ATT&amp;CK framework this technique is known as <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/">T1203</a>, which we can find in 177 campaigns and threat profiles in MVISION Insights.</p>

<h3><strong>Threat Profile APT41 &amp; APT41 Malware Identified Doing the ChaCha at SAS21</strong></h3>
<p>APT41 is a state sponsored threat group linked to China and associated with multiple campaigns, including a new campaign reported in September 2021. Although Ransomware is currently the main cyber threat type which hits the news, state sponsored threat groups are equally concerning, especially in the public sector for organizations with sensitive government and citizen data, which could be potentially exploited by a foreign nation like China.</p>
<p>In the second part of this report, we highlight how you can leverage the data from MVISION Insights to find traces of these attacks to enhance your level of protection.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-131461 aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.10.20-AM-300x241.png" alt="" width="356" height="286" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.10.20-AM-300x241.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.10.20-AM-160x129.png 160w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.10.20-AM.png 644w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Cloud Threats Affecting the Public Sector</strong></h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/threats-reports/oct-2021.html">October 2021 Threat Report</a>, McAfee Enterprise ATR also assessed the prevalence of Cloud Threats, identifying the US Government sector as one of the top 10 verticals affected.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131464" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM-1024x416.png" alt="" width="1024" height="416" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM-1024x416.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM-300x122.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM-768x312.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM-205x83.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.11.39-AM.png 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Many governments are moving quickly to adopt cloud technologies to bring services for their citizens, for collaboration and cost savings.</p>
<p>Inadequate readiness to address cloud security has been the primary contributor of these threats. Several cloud-native controls exist to protect sensitive data from loss or theft in real time, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/how-mvision-cnapp-helps-protect-against-chaosdb/">Cloud Native Application Protection Platform</a> (CNAPP) to secure your cloud services</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/sase-cloud-threats-and-mitre/">Secure Access Service Edge</a> (SASE) to secure access to all cloud services</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Operationalize Threat Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>In the second part of this report, we want to give you some guidance on how you can operationalize this threat intelligence data to better protect your networks. MVISION Insights can help operationalize McAfee Enterprise Threat Intelligence data <strong>by providing risk assessment against threats affecting you, protective guidance and integrating with other tools to share threat data</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take the previous example of the Conti Ransomware Threat Profile. Below you can see how MVISION Insights provides:</p>
<p>1. A short description with the list of CVEs linked to this threat profile, the minimum version of McAfee Enterprise ENS AMcore content to be correctly protected against this threat, detections in your environment and on which device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131467" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1.png" alt="" width="325" height="330" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1.png 325w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1-295x300.png 295w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1-127x129.png 127w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1-24x24.png 24w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1-48x48.png 48w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture1-96x96.png 96w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p>2. The list of related campaigns, the devices with unresolved detections related to these campaigns or those with insufficient protections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131470" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2-1024x165.png" alt="" width="1024" height="165" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2-1024x165.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2-300x48.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2-768x124.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2-205x33.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture2.png 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>3. The list of MITRE techniques and tools, which provide a universal and agnostic overlay of the threats, as well as details on the observables specific to this threat profile for each MITRE technique.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131473" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture3.png" alt="" width="571" height="305" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture3.png 571w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture3-300x160.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture3-205x110.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></p>
<p>4. The list of IOCs with filters, IOC attributes, and IOC export features which you can use to share them with your other solutions, such as your SIEM, and which you can also share with other public sector entities. We also provide a direct integration with MVISION EDR. Alternatively, you can leverage the APIs to automate the exchange of IOCs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131476" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture4.png" alt="" width="782" height="366" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture4.png 782w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture4-300x140.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture4-768x359.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture4-205x96.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<p>If you find devices with these IOCs in MVISION EDR you can take immediate remote actions such as quarantine the device, kill the process, remove the files, or run custom scripts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131479" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture5.png" alt="" width="782" height="299" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture5.png 782w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture5-300x115.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture5-768x294.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture5-205x78.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<p>You can also use MVISION EDR for more advanced threat hunting such as searching for specific MITRE techniques in all MVISION EDR alerts …</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131482" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture6.png" alt="" width="510" height="206" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture6.png 510w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture6-300x121.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture6-205x83.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>… or in the MVISION EDR monitoring view which automatically groups the alerts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131485" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture7.png" alt="" width="782" height="385" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture7.png 782w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture7-300x148.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture7-768x378.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture7-205x101.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<p>5. MVISION Insights also provides hunting rules created by McAfee Enterprise Threat Intelligence experts using Yara, Sigma and McAfee Enterprise ENS expert rules.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131488" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8-1024x805.png" alt="" width="1024" height="805" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8-1024x805.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8-300x236.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8-768x604.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8-164x129.png 164w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture8.png 1087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>6. A proactive assessment of your Endpoint and Cloud security posture score with guidance on the configuration changes which you should follow to ensure that your McAfee Enterprise Endpoint and Cloud solutions are protecting you with their full capabilities.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131491" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM-1024x563.png" alt="" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM-1024x563.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM-300x165.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM-768x422.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM-205x113.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-10.19.59-AM.png 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>7. And all this, with more than 1,200 threat campaigns and threat profiles</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131494" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9-1024x587.png" alt="" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9-1024x587.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9-300x172.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9-768x440.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9-205x117.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Picture9.png 1087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

We often do not heed the guidance of the common anecdotes we hear throughout our days and years. From <em>“look before you leap”</em> to <em>“an apple a day keeps the doctor away”</em> – we take these sayings in stride, especially when we cannot necessarily provide proof of their veracity!</p>
<p>One particular trope that may incite ire, frustration, or regret when applied to enterprise security is – <em>“once bitten, twice shy.”</em></p>
<p>In its very literal sense, we’re taught that if we’re bitten by something once – whether that be dog or security breach – we’re innately cautious or fearful of falling into a similar scenario. With dogs or any animal, we may pivot our behavior to avoid sharp teeth. However, with security breaches, many enterprises continue to be blindsided by “bites” – despite believing they’ve taken the utmost of caution to protect against them.</p>
<p>There is a clear disconnect between enterprise-preparedness and the severity of today’s threat landscape. We continue to see that no enterprise is immune to threats and breaches, with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/threats-reports/oct-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ransomware campaigns continuing to get more sophisticated and prevalent</a>. We’re also seeing cyber criminals work together, banding as an enterprise themselves sharing common tools and knowledge. This means, as cyber criminals become more business-savvy, operational, and efficient – the enterprises they look to attack need to consistently be one step ahead to anticipate and prevent breaches.</p>
<h2><strong>Safety First, Now More Than Ever</strong></h2>
<p>The term digital transformation is not new by any means, but it needs to be newly approached through a security-first lens. For successful digital transformation to occur today, major industries need to focus on superior prevention against threats.</p>
<p>It’s time for business leaders to stop focusing on the “breach of the month” and more on building security into the fabric of their organizations so they&#8217;re not the next victims. For this to happen, it is imperative to break down silos of threat and information intelligence across the organization, enabling a collaborative, holistic, and strategic approach to securing the business.</p>
<p>Additionally, as we’re seeing more prevalent and sophisticated attacks, enterprises need to lean into the transformative technologies that can keep up with evolving techniques. AI provides for personalization of security – a key advantage as it can prioritize detection and response to allow organizations to focus on growth outcomes instead of spending time recouping lost data, customers, revenue, efficiencies, or more that can come at the expense of a threat or breach.</p>
<p>Placing security at the forefront of strategies can unleash the full potential of what digital transformation can make possible. With this approach and a mindset focused on prevention and cyber-readiness as the catalyst aiding true digital and business transformation, we have the power to turn the headlines around. It is time for enterprises to bite back, and the criminals to shy away.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In short, the answer is “no.” Which is a good thing, as your name and address are in fact part of the public record. Anyone can get a hold of them. However, because they are public information, they are still tools that identity thieves can use. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you think of your identity as a jigsaw puzzle, your name and address are the first two pieces that they can use to build a bigger picture and ultimately put your identity at risk. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, let’s look at some other key pieces of your identity that are associated with your name and address—and what you can do to protect them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For starters, this information is so general that it is of little value in of itself to an identity thief. Yet a determined identity thief can do a bit of legwork and take a few extra steps to use them as a springboard for other scams. For example, with your name and address a thief could:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Research public databases for further pieces of information about you.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are volumes of public information that are readily available should someone want to add some more pieces to your identity jigsaw puzzle, such as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">How long you’ve lived in your current home, what you paid for it, and what it’s valued at today.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., </span><a href="https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/public-records-archival-data/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the availability of such information will vary from state-to-state and different levels of government may have different regulations about what information gets filed—in addition to whether and how those reports are made public</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Globally, different nations and regions will collect varying amounts of public information and have their own regulations in place as well. More broadly, though, many of these public databases are now online. Consequently, accessing them is easier than the days when getting a hold of that information required an in-person visit a library or public office.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Send you phishing attacks and scams by physical mail.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing attacks aren’t just for email, texts, and direct messages. </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-avoid-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">In fact, thieves are turning to old tricks via old-fashioned physical mail</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. That includes sending phony offers or by impersonating officials of government institutions, all designed to trick you into giving up your personally identifiable information (PII). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What might that look like in your mailbox? They can take the form of bogus lottery prizes that request bank information for routing (non-existent) winnings. Another favorite of scammers are bogus tax notifications that demand immediate payment. In all, many can look quite convincing at first blush, yet there are ready ways you can spot them. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">many of the tips for avoiding these physical mail phishing attacks are the same for avoiding phishing attacks online, which we outline in detail here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Redirect your physical mail, essentially committing mail fraud.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Recently, I’ve seen a few </span><a href="https://www.whec.com/news/in-depth-mail-forwarding-scams-on-the-rise/6152637/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">news stories like this</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> where thieves reportedly abuse the change-of-address system with the U.S. Postal Service. Thieves will simply forward your mail to an address of their choosing, which can drop sensitive information like bank and credit card statements in their mailbox. From there, they could potentially have new checks sent to them or perhaps an additional credit card—both of which they can use to drain your accounts and run up your bills.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Postal Service has mechanisms in place to prevent this, however. Among which, the Postal Service will send you a physical piece of mail to confirm the forwarding. So, if you ever receive mail from the Postal Service, open it and give it a close look. If you get such a notice and didn’t order the forwarding, visit your local post office to get things straightened out. Likewise, if it seems like you’re missing bills in the mail, that’s another good reason to follow up with your post office and the business in question to see if there have been any changes made in your mail forwarding. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting your good name (and identity too)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while your name and address are out there for practically all to see, they’re largely of little value to an identity thief on their own. But as mentioned above, they are key puzzle pieces to your overall identity. With enough of those other pieces in hand, that’s where an identity thief can cause trouble. Other crucial pieces of your identity include: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your Social Security Number or tax ID number:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with the biggest one. This is the master key to your identity, as it is one of the most unique identifiers you have. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/how-to-report-identity-theft-to-social-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">As I covered in my earlier blog on Social Security fraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a thief can unlock everything from credit history and credit line to tax refunds and medical care with your Social Security or tax ID number. In extreme cases, they can use it to impersonate you for employment, healthcare, and even in the event of an arrest. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can protect your Social Security Number by keeping it locked in a safe place (rather than in your wallet) and by providing your number only when absolutely necessary. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/how-to-report-identity-theft-to-social-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">For more tips on keeping your number safe, drop by that blog on Social Security fraud I mentioned</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your passport and driver’s license:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thieves have figured out ways of getting around the fact that IDs like these include a photo. They may be able to modify or emulate these documents “well enough” to pull off certain types of fraud, particularly if the people requesting their bogus documents don’t review them with a critical eye.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself in this case means knowing where these documents are at any time. (With passports, you may want to store those securely like your Social Security or tax ID number.) Also be careful when you share this information, as the identifiers on these documents are highly unique. If you’re uncomfortable with sharing this information, you can ask if other forms of ID might work—or if this information is really needed at all. Also, take a moment to make copies of these documents and store them in a secure place. This can help you provide important info to the proper authorities if they’re lost or stolen. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your card and account information: </span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/data-breach-security-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With data breaches large and small making the news</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (and many more that do not), keeping a sharp eye on your accounts is a major part of identity theft prevention. We talk about this topic quite often, and it’s worth another mention because protecting these means protecting yourself from thieves who’re after direct access to your finances and more. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Secure your digital accounts for banking, credit cards, financials, and shopping by </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts that you change every 60 days</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Sound like a lot of work? </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Let a password manager do it for you, which you can find in comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. By changing your strong passwords and keeping them unique can help prevent you from becoming a victim if your account information is part of a breach—by the time a crook attempts to use it, you may have changed it and made it out of date.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Extra steps for extra identity protection </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to protecting the core forms of identity mentioned above, a few other good habits go a long way toward keeping your identity secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Install and use online protection software:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> By protecting your devices, you protect what’s on them, like your personal information. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software can protect your identity in several ways</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, like create and manage the strong, unique passwords we talked about and provide further services that monitor and protect your identity—in addition to digital shredders that can permanently remove sensitive documents (simply deleting them won’t do that alone.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Shred your stuff:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Identity theft where thieves dig through trash or go “dumpster diving” for literal scraps of personal info in bills and statements, has been an issue for some time. You can prevent it by shredding up any paper medical bills, tax documents, and checks once you’re through with them. Paper shredders are inexpensive, and let’s face it, kind of fun too. Also, if you’re traveling, have a trusted someone collect your mail or have the post office put a temporary hold on your mail. Thieves still poach mail from mailboxes too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Go paperless:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Getting statements online cuts the paper out of the equation and thus removes another thing that a thief can physically steal and possibly use against you. Whether you use electronic statements through your bank, credit card company, medical provider, or insurance company, use a secure password and a secure connection provided by a VPN. Both will make theft of your personal info far tougher on identity thieves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Use a VPN:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A VPN is a Virtual Private Network</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a service that protects your data and privacy online. It creates an encrypted tunnel to keep you anonymous, by masking your IP address, while connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots. This is a great way to shield your information from crooks and snoops while you’re banking, shopping, or handling any kind of sensitive information online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Monitor your accounts:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Give your statements a close look each time they come around. While many companies and institutions have fraud detection mechanisms in place, they don’t always catch every instance of fraud. Look out for strange purchases or charges and follow up with your bank or credit card company if you suspect fraud. Even the smallest charge could be a sign that something shady is afoot.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Check your credit report:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> This is a powerful tool for spotting identity theft. And in many cases, it’s free to do so. In the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">requires the major credit agencies to provide you with a free credit check</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> at least once every 12 months. </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-reports-score/order-credit-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Canada provides this service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://moneyaware.co.uk/2017/05/how-to-get-your-credit-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the UK has options to receive free reports as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, along with several other nations. It’s a great idea to check your credit report, even if you don’t suspect a problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your name and address are just two pieces of a larger puzzle</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While thieves need more than just your name and address to commit the overwhelming majority of fraud, your name and address are centerpieces of the larger jigsaw puzzle that is your overall identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And the interesting thing is your puzzle gets larger and larger as time goes on. With each new account you create and service that you sign into, that’s one more piece added to the puzzle. Thieves love getting their hands on any pieces they can because with enough of them in place they can try and pull a fast one in your name. By looking after each piece and knowing what your larger jigsaw puzzle looks like, you can help keep identity thieves out of your business and your life.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

McAfee Enterprise&#8217;s MVISION Unified Cloud Edge (UCE) is designed to maximize performance, minimize latency, and deliver 99.999% SLA guaranteed resiliency, offering blazing fast connectivity to cloud applications from any location and causing no service degradation, even when the usage of cloud services spiked 600% during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in our </em><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-cloud-adoption-and-risk-report-work-from-home-edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Cloud Adoption and Risk Report (Work From Home Edition)</em></a><em>. This blog shares details on how MVISION UCE is architected to enable uninterrupted access to corporate resources to meet the demands of the hybrid workforce.</em></p>
<p>MVISION UCE, our data-centric, cloud-native <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/realize-your-sase-vision-with-security-service-edge-and-mcafee-enterprise/?eid=6D51GUQV&amp;smcid=LNO&amp;utm_campaign=employee&amp;utm_source=employee&amp;utm_medium=organic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Service Edge (SSE)</a> security platform, derives its capabilities from McAfee Enterprise&#8217;s industry leading <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-named-a-2021-gartner-peer-insights-customers-choice-for-swg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Web Gateway</a> and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-unstructured-data-security-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enterprise Data Protection</a> solutions. However, this is not a lift and shift of capabilities to the cloud, which would have made it prone to service outages and impossible to have the flexibility that is needed to meet the demands of SSE. Instead, the best of breed functionality was purposefully reconstructed for SSE, using a microservices architecture that can scale elastically, and built on a platform-neutral stack that can run on bare metal and public cloud, equally effectively. A hallmark of the architecture is that the cloud is a single global fabric where service instances are spread throughout the globe. Users automatically access the best instance of any service through policy configuration.</p>

<p>What other alternatives are out there? We have seen some cloud services replicated in each region of their presence. While this makes controlling resources and data simple, and keeps everything within a boundary, such an approach loses out on the flexibility needed to scale on demand and reduced latency on access. With UCE, each point of presence (POP) is part of the global fabric, yet at the same time, fully featured with all services housed within the POP. This avoids the need to send traffic back and forth between various services located at different locations, a phenomenon known as traffic hairpin.</p>
<p>By default, user traffic gets processed at the POP closest to their physical location, regardless of where the user may be. A user may work at their office in New York 90% of the time and travel to UK occasionally. When the user connects to MVISON UCE, they are connected to New York POP when they are at office, and the POP in London if they are in a UK hotel while traveling. This is a big advantage if you think about it. User&#8217;s traffic does not need to trombone from the hotel in UK, to the POP in New York and back to a server in London. MVISION UCE&#8217;s out-of-the-box traffic routing scheme favors low latency. This does not mean that the customer cannot override this policy and force the traffic to be processed at the New York POP. They might do so if there is a compliance need to process all traffic at a certain location. Many customers have a need to store logs in a certain geography even though traffic processing may occur anywhere on the globe. MVISION UCE architecture decouples log storage from traffic processing and lets the customer choose their log storage geography based on criteria that customers define.</p>

<p>One of the key considerations while choosing a SSE vendor would be how much latency the service adds to user&#8217;s requests. Significant latency can negatively affect user experience and could be a deterrent to product adoption. With 85 POPs strategically placed around the globe providing low latency access to customers, UCE POPs have direct peering with the biggest SaaS vendors like Microsoft, Google, Akamai, and Salesforce to further reduce latency. In addition, MVISION UCE POPs peer with many ISPs around the globe, enabling high bandwidth and low latency connectivity end to end, from the customer’s network to UCE and from UCE to the destination server.</p>
<p>With thousands of peering partners growing every day, over 70% of traffic served by MVISION UCE uses peering links in some geographies. The whitepaper, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/white-papers/wp-how-peering-pops-make-negative-latency-possible.pdf">How Peering POPs Make Negative Latency Possible</a>, shares details about a study conducted by McAfee Enterprise to measure the efficacy of these peering relationships. This paper is proof that UCE customers experience faster response times going through our POPs than they would usually get by going directly through their Internet Service Providers. UCE follows a living partnership model when it comes to peering, with thousands of peering relationships in production. We are committed to keeping the latency to a minimum.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what the secret sauce is for achieving a reliability of five 9s or higher in MVISION UCE. Several items play a crucial role in preventing unplanned service degradation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Redundantly provisioned components that allow for one or more instances to pick up the work when one of them goes down. Unexpected system failures and interruptions do occur in the real world and having a good architecture that detects failures early and reroutes the traffic to another suitable instance is paramount to maintaining availability. A combination of client redirection, server-side redirection, along with deep application state tracking, is used to seamlessly bypass a failed spot. The global nature of the fabric allows for multiple simultaneous failures without causing a local outage.</li>
<li>State of the art automation and deployment infrastructure is key to localize issues, maintain redundancy, and react automatically when issues are found. Containerized workloads over Kubernetes are the foundation of the cloud infrastructure in MVISION UCE, which facilitates fast recovery, canary rollouts of software, and elastic scaling of the infrastructure in case of peak demand. This is combined with an extensive automation and monitoring framework that monitors the customer’s experience and alerts the operations team of any localized or global service degradation.</li>
<li>Ability to scale up on demand at a global scale. We are not talking about scale out within a POP here. Many times, physical data centers have a hard limit on resources and sometimes it takes several months to add new servers and resources at a physical site. We are talking about bursting out to newly provisioned POPs when the traffic demands, in a matter of hours. Through extensive automation and intelligent traffic routing, a new MVISION UCE POP can be deployed in public cloud quickly and start absorbing load, providing the needed cushion to avoid traffic peaks that could otherwise cause service degradation when usage patterns change. This capability allowed MVISION UCE to successfully handle increasing demand when customer VPNs could not handle the load created by dramatically increased remote work due to the pandemic last year.</li>
</ol>

<p>At McAfee Enterprise, security is not an afterthought. From the start, the architecture was designed with zero trust in mind. Services are segmented from one another and follow the least privileged principle when resources need to be shared between services. Industry standard protocols and methodologies are used to enforce user and identity access management (UAM/IAM). Strong role-based access controls (RBAC) across the platform keep customer&#8217;s data separate and provide self-defense when a service is compromised. None of these features matter if the software is vulnerable. McAfee Enterprise follows one of the strictest Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes in the industry to eliminate known vulnerabilities and threats in our software as it is written.</p>
<p>Another aspect of security that is gaining momentum these days is data privacy. This is at the forefront of all feature designs in MVISION UCE. Usually, data privacy means tokenization or anonymization of customer private data stored in MVISION UCE, be it logs or other metadata. At McAfee Enterprise, we strive to take this a step further. We do not want to retrieve private data from the customer environment if it can be avoided. For example, to evaluate a policy that involves customer premise data, UCE can offload the evaluation to a component on the customer premise. Case in point, McAfee Client Proxy (MCP) that is installed on user’s machine can perform a policy evaluation and avoid sending private data to the cloud. The McAfee Enterprise cloud leverages the results of the evaluation to complete the policy execution. Where this is not possible, private data is anonymized at the earliest entry point in the cloud to minimize data leaks.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and physical data center security must also be considered. Global partners are selected only after careful evaluation of their facilities and infrastructure that will host our data centers, while other vendors in this space are working with a larger set of less rigorously qualified regional partners to increase their presence. The McAfee Enterprise approach provides the necessary guard rails against supply chain attacks that our customers demand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-131200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM-1024x473.png" alt="" width="1024" height="473" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM-1024x473.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM-300x139.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM-768x355.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM-205x95.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-2.26.19-PM.png 1398w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There are other architectural gems hidden within UCE and thus failing to mention them would make this article incomplete. First, the policy engine is exposed in the form of code with which the customer can construct complex policies without being constrained by what UI provides. If you are a user of MVISON UCE, you can see this in action by enabling &#8220;Code View&#8221; in the Web Policy tree. If you do not like the way policy nodes are ordered in the tree or the evaluations made by default, you can take complete control and process the traffic in any manner you wish. By the way, the policy is so flexible that one can write a policy to process traffic in one region and store logs in another region.</p>
<p>Second, policy evaluation can be distributed across various components which allows its evaluation at the earliest point in the network. This avoids hauling all traffic to the cloud to apply policy. For example, if a sensitive document needs to be blocked due to data protection rules, the DLP agent running on the user’s machine can block it instead of hauling the traffic to cloud for classification and blocking. This strategy reduces load on the cloud and consequently increases the scale at which we can process requests.</p>
<p>Lastly, all services are automated and require no manual intervention to provision a customer unlike other vendors that require a support ticket to provision some features. Independent of where your account has been provisioned and where your preferred UI console resides, polices that you author are stored in a global policy system that is synchronized to all POPs around the world, giving you the flexibility to process traffic anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>To conclude, all clouds are not built equally. Architecture of a cloud is a matter of choice and tradeoffs. MVISON UCE implements a global cloud and puts customers in the driver’s seat through programmatic policies, that are secure, scalable, and highly available.</p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: What is one of the most helpful skills you have developed in your career at McAfee?</span></b></h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Listening persistently and patiently .</em></p>
<p><em>Being heard and delivering growth starts with listening.  In a complex organization, there can be a lot of people impacted by what might, at first, be considered a simple change.   </em></p>
<p><em>Persistence and tenacity are what helps you maintain your drive towards a goal or a project.    </em></p>
<p><em>Patience is what pulls it all together. It takes time to get everyone on board, and then it takes more time for them to align, start, forget, get distracted, restart, fall down, pick themselves up and start running. &#8220;</em></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: What makes your role exciting?</span></b></h3>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">&#8220;I love working and interacting with people across all functions, groups, and locations. I love learning about new cultures, perspectives, and the different behaviors of consumers worldwide that we have to plan and adapt for. I also love the diversity of work and activity of what I get to do! &#8221;</span></i></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: Tell us about a time when you had to get outside of your comfort zone to further your career development.</span></b></h3>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">&#8220;One day my leader asked me if I would be willing to move into a sales role to better align with the strategic direction of the company while building out my own skillset. Instead of panicking about the unknown, I made a decision to embrace this as a growth opportunity. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:336,&quot;335559740&quot;:336}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">From scratch, I built up a sales pipeline, learned how to negotiate, run contracts, and negotiate. I shadowed our best sales leaders, read and re-read &#8216;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#8217;, learned Sandler methodology, and had to cold call (it’s not as scary as it sounds and there’s a true art in doing it well!). </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:336,&quot;335559740&quot;:336}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">The result of these efforts? I closed multiple deals and built up a digital reseller network. I still remember the first deal I closed. As soon as the prospect agreed to the number proposed, I kicked myself under the table… I realized I should have negotiated and asked for more!

<h2><strong>5G and IoT Traffic Between API Services and Apps Will Make Them Increasingly Lucrative Targets</strong></h2>
<p>Recent statistics suggest that <a href="https://thenewstack.io/akamai-the-financial-sector-is-seeing-more-apis-based-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 80% of all internet traffic belongs to API-based services</a>. It’s the type of increased usage that grabs the attention of threat developers hunting for rewarding targets.</p>
<p>Feature-rich APIs have moved from being just a middleware to applications and have evolved to become the backbone of most modern applications that we consume today. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>5G mobile applications – 5G connectivity and deployment of IoT endpoints have increased dramatically providing higher capacity for broader connectivity needs.</li>
<li>Internet of Things – More than 30.9 billion IoT devices are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2021/02/07/cybersecurity-threats-the-daunting-challenge-of-securing-the-internet-of-things/?sh=2a56ebec5d50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to be in use worldwide by 2025. The industrial IoT market was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/07/01/integrating-the-industrial-internet-of-things-the-benefits-and-challenges/?sh=6fc5e4aa306f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> to reach $124 billion in 2021</li>
<li>Dynamic web-based productivity suites – Global cloud-based office productivity software market <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/global-cloud-based-office-productivity-143000120.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is expected to reach $50.7 billion</a> by 2026</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, attacks targeting APIs go undetected as they are generally considered as trusted paths and lack the same level of governance and security controls.</p>
<p>The following are some of the key risks that we see evolving in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>Misconfiguration of APIs resulting in unwanted exposure of information.</li>
<li>Exploitation of modern authentication mechanisms such as Oauth/Golden SAML to obtain access to APIs and persist within targeted environments.</li>
<li>Evolution of traditional malware attacks to use more of the cloud APIs, such as the Microsoft Graph API, to land and expand. We have already seen evidence of this in the SolarWinds attack as well as other threat actors such as<a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB93758" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> APT40/ GADOLINIUM</a>.</li>
<li>Potential misuse of the APIs to launch attacks on enterprise data, such as ransomware on cloud storage services like OneDrive, etc.</li>
<li>The usage of APIs for software-defined infrastructure also means potential misuse leading to complete infrastructure takeover or shadow infrastructure being created for malicious purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gaining visibility into application usage with the ability to look at consumed APIs should be a priority for organizations, with the goal of ultimately having a risk-based inventory of accessed APIs and a governance policy to control access to such services. Having visibility of non-user-based entities within the infrastructure such as service accounts and application principles that integrate APIs with the wider enterprise eco-system is also critical.</p>
<p>For developers, developing an effective threat model for their APIs and having a Zero Trust access control mechanism should be a priority alongside effective security logging and telemetry for better incident response and detection of malicious misuse.</p>
<h2><strong>Expanded Exploitation of Containers Will Lead to Endpoint Resource Takeovers</strong></h2>
<p>Containers have become the de facto platform of modern cloud applications. Organizations see benefits such as portability, efficiency and speed which can decrease time to deploy and manage applications that power innovation for the business. However, the accelerated use of containers increases the attack surface for an organization. Which techniques should you look out for, and which container risk groups will be targeted? Exploitation of public-facing applications (MITRE T1190) is a technique often used by APT and Ransomware groups. MITRE T1190 has become a common entry vector given that cyber criminals are often avid consumers of security news and are always on the lookout for a good exploit. There are numerous past examples in which vulnerabilities concerning remote access software, webservers, network edge equipment and firewalls have been used as an entry point.</p>
<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) identified <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2021/05/05/application-container-security-risks-and-countermeasures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple container risk groups</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image risks
<ul>
<li>vulnerabilities</li>
<li>configuration defects</li>
<li>embedded malware</li>
<li>embedded clear text secrets</li>
<li>use of untrusted secrets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orchestrator
<ul>
<li>unbounded administrative access</li>
<li>unauthorized access</li>
<li>poorly separated inter-container network traffic</li>
<li>mixing of workload sensitivity levels</li>
<li>orchestrator node trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registry
<ul>
<li>insecure connections to registries</li>
<li>stale images in registries</li>
<li>insufficient authentication and authorization restrictions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Container
<ul>
<li>vulnerabilities within the runtime software</li>
<li>unbounded network access from containers</li>
<li>insecure container runtime configurations</li>
<li>app vulnerabilities</li>
<li>rogue containers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Host OS Component
<ul>
<li>large attack surface</li>
<li>shared kernel</li>
<li>improper user access rights</li>
<li>host file system tampering</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you protect yourself? Recommended mitigations include bringing security into the DevOps process through continuous posture assessment for misconfigurations, checks for integrity of images, and controlling administrative privileges. Use the Mitre ATT&amp;CK Matrix for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containers</a> to identify gaps in your cloud security architecture.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here are a few types of spyware and facts about each:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is it legal?</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Definitely not!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-a-keylogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Keyloggers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are the most intrusive of the spyware variations. It does exactly as its name suggests: It takes note of keyboard strokes, logs them, and reports to the owner of the nefarious software. Once the cybercriminal has digitally looked over your shoulder at your online activity, they make note of your passwords, walk into your online accounts, and pilfer your private personal information. They could use this information to gain entry to your online bank accounts or steal your identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Keyloggers are downloaded onto devices (cellphones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers) without the user’s knowledge. Cybercriminals can hide them within email attachments or in malicious web pages. So, the best way to steer clear of keyloggers is to never download attachments you’re unsure about and don’t visit sites that seem unprofessional. One rule of thumb is to mostly stick to URLs that begin with https and include a lock icon. These sites are almost always secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To determine if your device is infected with a keylogger, check your system’s performance. Is your device running slowly? See if there are any spikes in activity or unknown programs running in the background. This could indicate that your device is hosting a malicious program.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is it legal?</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Sometimes</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Adware is categorized as a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/spyware-a-major-identity-theft-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">type of spyware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It tracks users’ online activity and spits out targeted pop-up advertisements. If you have the pop-up blocker enabled on your browser, you’ll likely be spared from the annoyance. Additionally, pop-ups can slow your device, so that’s another reason to turn on the pop-up blocking feature. Legitimate adware often asks users to opt into targeted ads.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Adware turns malicious (and illegal) when it contains malware. Sometimes cyber criminals hide malware within pop-ups. It’s easy to accidentally hit a link within a pop-up when you’re aiming quickly for the X to close it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s easy to spot a device with an adware infestation. First, the number of pop-ups will be out of control. Also, the device will crash often, run very slowly, and have a short battery life. An </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">antivirus program</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> will likely be able to identify and remove the culprit. You can also check out your system monitor and end tasks that are draining your device’s power.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cookies are delicious, especially to advertisers who use them to better target ads and make profits selling collected user data to third-party companies. Cookies are sometimes categorized as spyware, because they log the websites you visit and report them. You may notice the banners on websites that ask you to accept cookies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many users today are uneasy with sharing their online activity with strangers and advertisers. Sometimes the ads that pop up on your social media feed or in sidebars seem a little too targeted and it feels like someone is listening in to your conversations and attempting to make a profit from them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">To scrub cybercriminals from your devices and confuse advertisers, consider the following steps you can easily add to your daily routine:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Clear your cache periodically. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">This is a quick way to delete all the cookies from your device. It also helps if your device is running slowly. Clearing your cache deletes your browsing history, meaning that you won’t be able to type in your usual shortcuts to your most-visited sites and the browser won’t automatically auto-fill the rest of the URL or remember your passwords. Consider making bookmarks of your favorite sites for quick access and entrust your passwords to a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/why-do-i-need-a-password-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that will remember them for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Know how to spot phishing attempts. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals often hide their spyware within </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing texts and emails</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, so it’s key to know how to spot them. Phishers trick users into acting quickly, either through scare tactics or fake exciting news, to download attachments or give up personal information. Luckily, phishing attempts usually aren’t too difficult to identify and delete immediately. Did you enter a contest lately? No? Then why would someone get in touch saying you’re a winner? Also, phishing messages are often full of typos and poor grammar. Before you click any links in an email, hover your cursor over it to see where the URL will take you. If it has typos, is filled with a long string of letters or numbers, or doesn’t match the site the message says it’ll redirect you to, delete it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Once users exit incognito mode, all of their browsing history and the cookies collected during the session are deleted. Incognito mode, though effective against cookies, does not combat keyloggers or aggressive adware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Wherever you may be on this 11th day of the 11th month, on the 11th hour, please be thankful to all our Veterans for their service and sacrifice. We would like to take a moment to reflect and honor some of our McAfee Enterprise employees who served.</p>
<h2><strong>When were you drafted or when did you enlist/join? What branch of the military did you serve and in what rank?</strong></h2>
<p>Shannon Clancy joined October 5, 2003 and was a Major in the United States Marine Corps</p>
<p>Kevin Benton enlisted ten days after high school (mid 1980’s) and was in the US Army as an E4/Specialist</p>
<p>Kevin Suares enlisted in the US Air Force on November 1, 1994, after four year’s he was a Senior Airman (E-4)</p>
<h2><strong>Why did you join and why did you pick the service branch you selected?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Clancy</strong>: I had always had a niggling in the back of my mind that I wanted to be a Marine (My father served as a Marine in Vietnam), and then September 11, 2001 happened and it solidified my choice. I wanted to be the best, and everyone knows Marines are the best.</p>
<p><strong>Benton:</strong> The world was bigger than my little hometown and I wanted to travel the world. Plus, I was clearly the smartest person in my house at 18 years old, so I showed my parents how smart I was.</p>
<p><strong>Suares:</strong> I needed money for college and needed some direction in life. Initially I considered the Navy, as I am a former Sea Scout. I spoke to a Navy recruiter and was ready to sign up. He sent me across the hall to “get a different perspective” from the Air Force recruiter (which I was also considering) and after a 20-minute conversation where we talked about options in the Air Force, Air Force training, how the Air Force encourages higher education and AF ethos, I changed my mind. Biggest regret of that Navy recruiter’s career! The next week I scored 97 out of 99 in the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) making me eligible for almost any job.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you remember about your first day in service? What do you remember about your last day in service?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Clancy</strong>: I remember my first day being total chaos. Not knowing the (now) simplest things like how to wear your cover (hat), blouse your trousers, align your belt, etc. Things that seem small and silly but were in fact critical lessons in attention to detail that have carried with me throughout service and life.</p>
<p><strong>Benton:</strong> On the first day, I was tired and nervous about not having any idea of what was happening or what to do. The last day was filled with wildly mixed emotions! I made some great friends from all walks of life, and I was ready to get on with my life by attending college on the GI Bill, but I hadn’t yet lived on my own. I recall driving off the base and wondering if I should drive north or south on the Pacific Coast Highway; ultimately, I drove North and have never regretted the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Suares:</strong> I remember on my first full day being woken up at 4:30 AM after going to bed around 1:30 AM, in a new environment to a metal trash can being hit repeatedly with a baton and words I can’t repeat here. On my last day, my supervisor still made me work the whole day, ending in a small ceremony where I was presented with a few token gifts (which I still have.) I wrote my flight a quick email saying goodbye then left for home. Not going to lie – I had tears in my eyes as I left the building.</p>
<h2><strong>What would you describe as your most memorable experience? What is something you miss about your days of service?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Clancy:</strong> My most memorable experience was my deployment to Iraq. There was a pause in operations on Thanksgiving and I got to play soccer with some of the Marines. It was a very “normal” thing in a place where there wasn’t much normal. I don’t miss much (because there is a lot of nonsense that also goes on), but what I do miss is the camaraderie and sense of belonging. You don’t question who you are or what your purpose is while you serve.</p>
<p><strong>Benton:</strong> Being in the infantry, I recall experiencing some of the toughest, most physically demanding moments in my life, then experiencing shear exhaustion when reaching the end of a march or landing in a hot zone, only to have a few laughs with the guys to your left and right, toggling thru each other’s life stories.  No one cared where you were from or the color of our skin or whether you had any money. I’ll never forget the laughs and storytelling as we were all experiencing the same things at the same time. Come to find out, we were forming bonds for life.</p>
<p><strong>Suares:</strong> My most pleasant memory wastaking my grandfather out to dinner in uniform for his 70th birthday. He was so proud that he was speechless for once. If you knew him, that was a really big deal. But my saddest memory was hearing the rifle salute at a friend’s funeral. Each volley cut me to the bone.</p>
<h2><strong>How do you honor Veterans/Remembrance Day for yourself, with family or friends?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Clancy:</strong> I usually call my dad. Veterans day buddies right up to the Marine Corps Birthday, so there is no shortage of celebrations or drinks to be shared among Marines. This year has been extremely difficult on veterans; so, I think I’ll text a few friends I haven’t heard from in a while. I encourage everyone to reach out to one you know, just to check in and say hi. It goes a lot further than you might think.</p>
<p><strong>Benton:</strong> Our little town holds a ceremony at our local cemetery. I’ve attended with my family for years, afterwards nearly always telling my kids stories of my service to my country and the pride I feel when seeing our flag and all that it stands for. ​​​​​​​</p>
<p><strong>Suares:</strong> Usually with service to others. Occasionally I may go out to dinner with family, but most times I used to be involved in giving talks to youth groups, schools, etc. or donating time to other Veterans causes. I proudly served my country – and would do it again if asked – but I feel that I am not owed anything. The day should be about recognizing the living service member (past or present) and honoring us all.</p>

<p>Due to their widespread use, Office Documents are commonly used by Malicious actors as a way to distribute their malware. McAfee Labs have observed a new threat “Squirrelwaffle” which is one such emerging malware that was observed using office documents in mid-September that infects systems with CobaltStrike.</p>
<p>In this Blog, we will have a quick look at the SquirrelWaffle malicious doc and understand the Initial infection vector.</p>
<p>Geolocation based stats of Squirrelwaffle malicious doc observed by McAfee from September 2021</p>

<h2>Infection Chain</h2>
<ol>
<li>The initial attack vector is a phishing email with a malicious link hosting malicious docs</li>
<li>On clicking the URL, a ZIP archived malicious doc is downloaded</li>
<li>The malicious doc is weaponized with <strong><em>AutoOpen</em></strong> VBA function. Upon opening the malicious doc, it drops a VBS file containing obfuscated <strong><em>powershell</em></strong></li>
<li>The dropped VBS script is invoked via <strong><em>exe</em></strong> to download malicious DLLs</li>
<li>Thedownloaded DLLs are executed via <strong><em>exe</em></strong> with an argument of export function “<strong><em>ldr</em></strong>”</li>
</ol>

<h2>Malicious Doc Analysis</h2>
<p>Here is how the face of the document looks when we open the document (figure 3). Normally, the macros are disabled to run by default by Microsoft Office. The malware authors are aware of this and hence present a lure image to trick the victims guiding them into enabling the macros.</p>
<figure id="attachment_131155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131155" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-131155" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-3-Image-of-Word-Document-Face.png" alt="Figure-3: Image of Word Document Face" width="628" height="278" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-3-Image-of-Word-Document-Face.png 628w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-3-Image-of-Word-Document-Face-300x133.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-3-Image-of-Word-Document-Face-205x91.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-131155" class="wp-caption-text">Figure-3: Image of Word Document Face</figcaption></figure>
<h2>UserForms and VBA</h2>
<p>The VBA Userform Label components present in the Word document (Figure-4) is used to store all the content required for the VBS file. In Figure-3, we can see the userform’s Labelbox “<strong>t2</strong>” has VBS code in its caption.</p>
<p>Sub routine “eFile()” retrieves the LabelBox captions and writes it to a <strong>C:\Programdata\Pin.vbs</strong> and executes it using <strong>cscript.exe</strong></p>
<p><u>Cmd line</u>: <em>cmd /c cscript.exe C:\Programdata\Pin.vbs</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_131158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131158" style="width: 784px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-131158 size-full" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-4-Image-of-Userforms-and-VBA.png" alt="Figure-4: Image of Userforms and VBA" width="784" height="385" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-4-Image-of-Userforms-and-VBA.png 784w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-4-Image-of-Userforms-and-VBA-300x147.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-4-Image-of-Userforms-and-VBA-768x377.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Figure-4-Image-of-Userforms-and-VBA-205x101.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-131158" class="wp-caption-text">Figure-4: Image of Userforms and VBA</figcaption></figure>
<h2><em>VBS Script Analysis</em></h2>
<p>The dropped VBS Script is obfuscated (Figure-5) and contains 5 URLs that host payloads. The script runs in a loop to download payloads using <strong><em>powershell</em></strong> and writes to <strong><em>C:\Programdata</em></strong> location in the format /<strong>www-[1-5].dl</strong>l/. Once the payloads are downloaded, it is executed using <strong><em>rundll32.exe</em></strong> with export function name as parameter “<strong><em><u>ldr</u></em></strong>”</p>

Many forwarding-thinking companies that have made massive investments in migrating their infrastructure to the cloud are facing challenges with respect to their cloud-native applications. These range from inconsistent security across cloud properties to lack of visibility into the public cloud infrastructure where cloud-native applications are hosted—and more. All of these issues can create vulnerabilities in a sprawling attack surface that can be potentially exploited by cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Legendary Entertainment is a global media company with multiple divisions including film, television, digital studios, and comics. Under the guidance of Dan Meacham, VP of Global Security and Corporate Operations and CSO/CISO, the multi-billion dollar organization transitioned from on-premises data centers to the cloud in 2012<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Meacham points out that it’s been a source of great pride for his security and IT teams to always be “on top of the latest and greatest” technology trends—and migration to the cloud is no exception. That’s why his interest was sparked when he learned about the rollout of the MVISION security product line early in the migration process. Its cloud-native, open architecture was exactly the right fit for Legendary Entertainment’s environment.</p>
<h2>The challenges of securing a multi-cloud environment</h2>
<p>As a cloud-first organization, Legendary Entertainment encountered challenges that are common to many companies that have migrated their workloads, applications, and data assets to the cloud. At first, the organization attempted to rely on security services natively provided by the individual cloud service providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Wasabi for cloud storage. As Meacham notes, “The security from one vendor doesn’t trickle over to the others. They all have different security controls, so our cloud security was not uniform, and security management was complicated.”</p>
<h3>Lack of visibility</h3>
<p>In their disparate multicloud environment spanning several cloud service providers, it became time-consuming and difficult to monitor and assess the security posture of applications and workloads, such as which systems needed patching or contained critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3>Inconsistent security policies</h3>
<p>With multiple management consoles required for its many cloud environments, applying and enforcing uniform security policy across their cloud estate was nearly impossible without investing a lot of time, effort, and resources.</p>
<h3>Risky Shadow IT</h3>
<p>Another problem in Legendary Entertainment’s early adoption of cloud-first was shadow IT, where employees or contractors enrolled in cloud collaboration platforms that were not authorized by IT. Although the shadow IT platforms were not connected to core systems, they made it more difficult to tightly monitor data which sometimes caused cloud-enabled applications to violate security policies. It is understandable that teams with a cloud-first mindset would embrace innovation and new collaborative experiences to accomplish goals faster. However, some of the shadow IT application has weak or no security controls – resulting the opportunities for external collaborator accounts to be compromised or have mis-managed privileges.</p>
<h3>Unacceptable levels of risk</h3>
<p>With high-profile data breaches in the entertainment industry in recent headlines, Legendary Entertainment was concerned about its level of risk and exposure, especially since it has valuable intellectual property such as scripts and marketing strategy plans for film releases among its holdings. The requirement for stronger security has been a boardroom-level conversation at digital media companies since the Sony Pictures hack and other vendor supply chain and workflow hacks. Attacks now extend beyond data leaks and can have far reaching business disruptions across an entire supply chain.</p>
<h2>How MVISION CNAPP creates a consistent, compliant cloud security posture</h2>
<p>By deploying  MVISION<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (MVISION CNAPP), Legendary Entertainment addressed all of these challenges at once. This unique solution prioritizes alerts and defends against the latest cloud threats and vulnerabilities. MVISION CNAPP combines granular application and data context with cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection in a single-console solution.</p>
<h3>Unparalleled visibility</h3>
<p>MVISION CNAPP provides Legendary Entertainment with broad and deep visibility across its entire infrastructure. It discovers all their cloud assets, including compute resources, containers, and storage and provides continuous visibility into vulnerabilities and security posture for applications and workloads running across multiple clouds.</p>
<p>Thanks to MVISION CNAPP, Meacham’s team can write, apply, and enforce security policies in a consistent fashion for the entire cloud estate. As Meacham points out, policy is continually checked so his team can correct any misconfigurations, disable services, or remove escalated privileges until corrections are made in alignment with internal compliance rules. And in many cases, the remediation can be automated internally in MVISION CNAPP or through workflow initiations.</p>
<p>“MVISION CNAPP gives me manageability and security uniformity for all our cloud platforms so that I can elevate the level of security and make it consistent across the board. Now that I have visibility into all our cloud assets from a high level, I can look at how current controls and configurations compare to our best practices, industry best practices, and to the best practices of peers who are using the same product. Without MVISION CNAPP, management is one to one, whereas with MVISION CNAPP, it’s one to many,” explains Meacham.</p>
<p>The Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) component of MVISION CNAPP provides Legendary Entertainment with on-demand scanning, which looks at all services used in the public cloud and checks their security settings against internal benchmarks. “This gives us a security posture score and provides feedback on what we can do to bring ourselves back into compliance,” observes Meacham. “If someone changes a configuration, we get an alert right away. And if it’s not in alignment with policy, we can roll it back to the previous settings. MVISION CNAPP also helps us remediate policy exceptions by clearly stating the risks, instances impacted, and the necessary step by step actions needed for resolution.”</p>
<h3>Banishing Shadow IT</h3>
<p>MVISION CNAPP also ensures that Legendary Entertainment’s developers operate in a secure environment by alerting the security team when their actions violate security policies or increase the risk of a data breach. This effectively puts a halt to Shadow IT.</p>
<p>“MVISION CNAPP helps me keep my system administrators and developers accountable for what they are doing. We can make sure that they are consistent in how they execute, deploy, and build things. Configuration policies, on-demand scans, and different types of checks in MVISION CNAPP can help force that compliance. I am able to keep tabs on my developers to make sure they are operating according to these guidelines in any platform,” remarks Meacham.</p>
<h3>Risk reduction through contextual entitlements</h3>
<p>MVISION CNAPP reduces risk associated with operating in the cloud, enabling Legendary Entertainment to run mission-critical applications and develop blockbuster movies such as “The Dark Knight Rises” and “Dune” securely across a heterogenous multicloud environment. The solution also enables contextual entitlements so that users can be identified and assigned selective access to and permissions for applications and resources based on the security profile of the devices they are using at any given time.</p>
<h3>Data protection with user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)</h3>
<p>Legendary Entertainment leverages MVISION CNAPP’s data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities to monitor activity in cloud data stores in order to help prevent data breaches. Unusual or suspicious activity or unauthorized movement of data transit is tracked and flagged immediately by leveraging built-in UEBA capabilities.</p>
<p>“If I see 2,000 files change in 30 seconds, that’s a huge red flag indicating ransomware or some other type of attack. The solution’s monitoring tool detects suspicious behavior and immediately brings that to our awareness. If we see something like that happening on multiple platforms, we know that immediate action is required.

News of the attack was released on Monday, November 8</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> along with word the hackers behind it had demanded an extortion payment from the company.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to Robinhood&#8217;s disclosure</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the attack occurred on November 3</span><span data-contrast="auto">rd</span><span data-contrast="auto">, which allowed an unauthorized party to obtain the following:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Email addresses for some 5 million people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Full names for another group of 2 million people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition, smaller groups of Robinhood customers had yet more information compromised. Around 310 people had their names, birth dates, and zip codes exposed in the breach. Another 10 customers had “more extensive account details revealed,” per Robinhood’s disclosure. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Robinhood went on to say, “We believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Robinhood further stated that the company contained the intrusion and that it promptly informed law enforcement of the extortion demand. Robinhood says that it is continuing to investigate the incident with the assistance of a security firm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The company advised its customers to visit the Robinhood help center to receive the latest messages from the company, noting that they will never include a link to access an account in a security alert.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Any data breach that you and your information may have been involved in calls for a few quick security steps:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">1. Log into your account and update your password with a new one that is strong and unique. Likewise, if you use the same or similar passwords across several accounts, change those as well. (</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A password manager that’s included with comprehensive online protection software can do that work for you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.) Set up two-factor authentication if your account allows for it, as this will provide an extra layer of protection as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">2. Review your statements for any strange activity—even the smallest of withdrawals or transactions could be the sign of a larger issue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">3. Report any suspected fraud to the company or institution involved. They typically have set policies and procedures in place to provide support.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you believe that you’ve become a victim of identity theft, file a report with local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Law enforcement can provide you with a case number that you may need as part of the recovery process. Likewise, the </span><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">FTC’s identity theft website provides excellent resources</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, including a recovery plan and a step-by-step walkthrough if you create an account with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For even more information, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/top-signs-of-identity-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">visit our blog that points out the signs of identity theft and the steps you can take should you find yourself victim</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">After the breach, keep a sharp eye out</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that the breach apparently exposed some 5 million email addresses, there’s the risk that these may end up in the hands of bad actors who may use them for follow-on attacks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Notable among them would be phishing attacks, where hackers could target Robinhood users with phony messages in an attempt to get affected users to reveal further account information. For example, hackers could potentially create bogus emails that appear to come from Robinhood and direct users to a malicious site that requests account information. As Robinhood stated, the company will never include a link to access an account in a security alert. Users should visit the Robinhood site directly for account information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This breach could lead to other phishing attacks as well, ones that may or may not pose as communication from Robinhood. Some of these phishing attacks can be rather easy to spot, as they may include typos, poorly rendered logos, or spoofed web addresses. However, some sophisticated hackers can roll out rather polished phishing attacks that can closely resemble legitimate communications. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, people can avoid falling victim to phishing attacks by keeping the following in mind:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">1. Only access your accounts directly from the official website of the company or financial institution involved. If you receive an email, message, or text alerting you of an issue, do not click any links provided in the communication. Go straight to the site yourself by typing in the proper address and view your account information there. Likewise, calling the customer support line posted on their official site is an option as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">2. Use comprehensive online protection software that includes a spam filter. This can prevent phishing emails from reaching your inbox in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">3. Get to know the signs of phishing emails. A common sign of a scam is an email, ad, message, or site that simply doesn’t look or read right. (Maybe the grammar is awkward or the logo is grainy or has the colors slightly wrong.) However, some of them can look quite convincing, yet there are still ways to spot an attempted phishing attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">4. Beware of email attachments you aren’t expecting. This is always good form because hackers love to spike attachments with malware that’s designed to steal your personal information. Whether you get an unexpected attachment from a friend or business, follow up before opening it. That’s a quick way to find out if the attachment is legitimate or not.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For more info on phishing and how to steer clear of it, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">check out our blog on how to spot phishing attacks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect your identity for the long haul</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The unfortunate fact is that data breaches can and do happen. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/data-breach-security-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Many of the larger data breaches make the headlines, yet many more do not</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—such as the ones that hit small businesses, restaurants, and medical care providers. In the hands of hackers, the information spilled by these breaches can provide them with the building blocks to commit identity theft. As a result, keeping on top of your identity and personal information is a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The good news is that you have solid options to prevent them from harming you or at least greatly lessen their potential impact. With </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, even in the short-term, you can monitor emails addresses and usernames that are being used to breach other accounts. You can monitor dozens of different types of personal information and receive alerts to keep an eye out for misuse. Likewise, it can monitor your email addresses and bank accounts for signs of misuse or fraud, plus provide theft protection and support from a recovery specialist if identity theft, unfortunately, happens to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Along those same lines, news of a data breach offers all of us a moment to pause and take stock of just how protected we are. Above and beyond the steps covered above, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection can protect your devices from malware, phishing attacks, malicious websites, and other threats. More importantly, it protects you—your identity and privacy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, particularly in times where breaches such as the one we’re talking about here occur with seeming regularity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

User interaction is a prerequisite since the vulnerability lies within the RDP client, requiring a victim to connect to a malicious RDP server.</p>
<h2>Vulnerability Analysis: CVE-2021-38666</h2>
<p>This RCE bug is very closely related to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/">CVE-2021-34535</a> and to <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1374">CVE-2020-1374 </a>, where there is a heap-based buffer overflow in mstscax.dll due to an attacker-controlled payload size field. The vulnerability can be triggered via the RDP Smart Card Virtual Channel Extension feature [MS-RDPESC], by leveraging the existing local RDPDR static virtual channel setup between the client and server. The RDP Smart Card Virtual Channel Extension feature [MS-RDPESC] functionality was leveraged in the “<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-dissection-esteemaudit-windows-remote-desktop-exploit/">EsteemAudit</a>” Exploit released by the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers">Shadow Brokers</a>,” but that vulnerability targeted the RDP server and not the client. The functionality being exploited here is the ability to share a smart card reader between the client and server. The destination buffer intended for the IOCTL (I/O control) call to locate each host smart card reader is a fixed size, but the user-controlled size field can be altered to cause the client to perform an OOB (Out of Bounds) write. Seeing how simple it is to trigger this vulnerability, our team decided to mutate the test case to verify whether any other IOCTLs within the [MS-RDPESC] specification are vulnerable. Enumerating through the 60 other IOCTL calls tied to the smart card reader, we were able to find two additional unique crashes. All vulnerabilities discovered have been patched in the latest version of the mstscax.dll, which shows that the fix for this bug has mitigated other potentially vulnerable functions. The patched mstscax.dll now simply verifies that the bytes received over the wire do not exceed the user-supplied size field; it does this at the IOCTL dispatch table level before any IOCTL functions are called, so the single validation is applied to all IOCTLs.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard) score of 8.8, dropped down from 9.8 because it requires user interaction in that a victim RDP client must connect to a malicious server.</p>
<h3>Attack Scenario</h3>
<p>This bug has the same attack scenario as that of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/">CVE-2021-34535</a>, which we also analyzed in depth:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a client-side vulnerability so not wormable</li>
<li>Requires a user to connect to a malicious RDP server</li>
<li>It impacts both the traditional RDP client over the network and the local Hyper-V Manager “Enhanced Session Mode” since they both use the vulnerable mstscax.dll</li>
<li>The vulnerability could be used for a guest-to-host escape on Hyper-V Windows 10</li>
</ol>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>We have seen a regular cadence of critical RDP vulnerabilities since BlueKeep (<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/rdp-stands-for-really-do-patch-understanding-the-wormable-rdp-vulnerability-cve-2019-0708/">CVE-2019-0708</a>), but what distinguishes the two vulnerabilities CVE-2021-38666 and CVE-2021-34535 is that they impact Hyper-V Manager “Enhanced Session Mode” and can thus be leveraged for guest-to-host escapes. While we do not rate these vulnerabilities as critical in the same manner as past RDP server-side RCE vulnerabilities, we are now clearly starting to see a trend of vulnerabilities emerging which impact Hyper-V Manager due to the porting of RDP. We recommend patching as a top priority as threat actors will potentially look to weaponize this common protocol for guest-to-host escapes on Windows 10 Hyper-V.</p>
<p>Microsoft has published a Knowledge Base article for this issue <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-38666">here</a> with information regarding patching this vulnerability. As always, we recommend patching as a first course of action and we will continue to monitor this vulnerability for any exploitation in the wild.</p>

While we tend to look at consumer tendencies during the holidays, the season also presents a significant challenge to industries coping with the increase in consumer demands. McAfee Enterprise and FireEye recently conducted a global survey of IT professionals to better understand their cyber readiness, especially during peak times like the holiday season, and the impact the pandemic has had on their business. Most notably, 86% of organizations are anticipating a moderate-to-substantial increase in demand during the 2021 holiday season. The question is: Are they ready for that demand?</p>
<p>This year, the “everything shortage” is real – from a drop in available workforce to limited supplies to lack of delivery services. This creates an urgency for organizations to have actionable security plans and to effectively contain and respond to threats. Supply chain and logistics, e-commerce and retail, and the travel industry traditionally experience holiday seasonal increases in consumer and business activity, making them more vulnerable to cyber threats and leaving business, employee, and consumer data at risk. Here’s a statistical snapshot of these affected industries and how they can prepare for the anticipated increase in seasonal risks:</p>
<h3><strong>Supply Chain and Logistics</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thebci.org/static/e02a3e5f-82e5-4ff1-b8bc61de9657e9c8/BCI-0007h-Supply-Chain-Resilience-ReportLow-Singles.pdf">BCI’s Supply Chain Resilience Report 2021</a>, 27.8% of organizations reported more than 20 supply chain disruptions during 2020, up from just 4.8% reporting the same number in 2019. The loss of manufacturing and logistics capacity, and employee-power in 2021 are expected to increase demand for goods, creating the perfect attack vector for cybercriminals: a potentially weak and vulnerable infrastructure to break through. Supply chain managers must identify risks, understand the potential downstream effects of a security breach or cyberattack, and prepare response plans so they can act quickly in the event of an incident.</p>
<h3><strong>E-Commerce and Retail</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://business.adobe.com/resources/digital-economy-index.html">Adobe’s 2021 Digital Economy Index</a>, global online spending is expected to increase by 11% in 2021 to $910 billion during the holiday season. With store closures and increases in online shopping, along with limited product availability and concerns about shipping, this industry is faced with more threats than before. According to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/covid-19-dashboard.html#overview">McAfee Enterprise COVID-19 dashboard</a>, the global retail industry accounts for 5.2% of the total detected cyber threats. Such threats include compromised payment credentials and cloud storage, as well as other forms of retail fraud and theft.</p>
<h3><strong>Travel</strong></h3>
<p>Cyber threats aren’t new to the travel industry with airports, airlines, travel sites and ride-sharing apps having been victims in years past. However, what sets this year apart is the travel industry enduring a holding pattern caused by pandemic-related health concerns and travel restrictions. According to the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2021-releases/2021-10-04-01/">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a>, coronavirus-related loss estimates for 2020 total $137.7 billion—with total industry losses in 2020-2022 expected to reach $201 billion. As demand for holiday travel is expected to increase over the coming months, cyber criminals are watching closely for vulnerabilities as the industry battles new related challenges – labor shortages, supply chain issues, travel bans, and vaccination requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>What Organizations Need to Know</strong></h2>
<p>McAfee Enterprise and FireEye threat findings unwrap the imminently crucial need for organizations to prioritize and strengthen their cybersecurity architecture through the holidays and end of 2021. Our research indicates that 81% of global organizations experienced increased cyber threats and 79% experienced downtime in the wake of previous cyberattacks.</p>
<p>While IT professionals know cyber threats have intensified, the findings prove that many organizations have not effectively prioritized security during COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>94% percent of IT professionals want their organization to improve its overall cyber readiness</li>
<li>60% saw an increase in online/web activity</li>
<li>33% have had their technology and security budgets reduced</li>
<li>56% have suffered from downtime due to a cyber concern, costing some over $100,000 USD</li>
<li>76% find maintaining a fully staffed security team/SOC even more challenging during peak periods</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Proactively Guarding Against Emerging Holiday Threats </strong></h2>
<p>Organizations can be proactive in defending their networks, data, customers, and employees against the anticipated increase in holiday cybercrime by implementing security measures including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt industry-wide cybersecurity requirements designed to protect against the latest iterations of cyber threats, especially those known to target specific industries.</li>
<li>Provide cybersecurity awareness training for employees, especially when encountering holiday phishing emails or texts and suspicious URL campaigns designed to breach organizational databases</li>
<li>Develop an incident response plan capable of responding and remedying a security breach in minutes rather than hours</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, enterprises and commercial businesses can implement cloud-delivered security with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/unified-cloud-edge.html">MVISION Unified Cloud Edge</a> (UCE) and <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/products/xdr.html">FireEye Extended Detection and Response</a> (XDR).</p>

Hackers are too. As people flock to retailers big and small in search of the best deals online, hackers have their shopping scams ready.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> Remember, McAfee frees you to live your connected life safe from threats like viruses, malware, phishing, and more. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html">Download award-winning antivirus</a> that protects your data and devices today.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One aspect of cybercrime that deserves a fair share of attention is the human element. Crooks have always played on our feelings, fears, and misplaced senses of trust. It’s no different online, particularly during the holidays. We all know it can be a stressful time and that we sometimes give into the pressure of finding that hard-to-get gift that’s so hot this year. Crooks know it too, and they’ll tailor their attacks accordingly as we get wrapped up in the rush of the season.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5 ways to spot an online shopping scam</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while you already know how to spot a great deal, here are ways you and your family can spot online shopping scams so you can keep your finances safer this shopping season:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Email attachments that pretend to be from legitimate retailers and shippers</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A common scam hackers use is introducing malware via email attachments, and during the holiday sale season, they’ll often send malware under the guise of offering emails and shipping notifications. Know that retailers and shipping companies won’t send things like offers, promo codes, and tracking numbers in attachments. They’ll clearly call those things out in the body of an email instead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Typosquat trickery</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A classic scammer move is to “typosquat” phony email addresses and URLs that look awfully close to legitimate addresses of legitimate companies and retailers. They often appear in phishing emails and instead of leading you to a great deal, these can in fact link you to scam sites that can then lift your login credentials, payment info, or even funds should you try to place an order through them. You can avoid these sites by going to the retailer’s site directly. Be skeptical of any links you receive by email, text, or direct message—it’s best to go to the site yourself by manually typing in the legitimate address yourself and look for the deal there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Copycat deals and sites</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A related scammer trick that also uses typosquatting tactics is to set up sites that look like they could be run by a trusted retailer or brand but are not. These sits may tout a special offer, a great deal on a hot holiday item, or whatnot, yet such sites are one more way cybercriminals harvest personal and financial information. A common way for these sites to spread is by social media, email, and other messaging platforms. Again a “close to the real thing” URL is a telltale sign of a copycat, so visit retailers directly. Also, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software can prevent your browser from loading suspicious sites</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and warn you of suspicious sites in your search results.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Counterfeit shopping apps</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While the best of them can look practically professional and be tough to spot, one way to avoid counterfeit shopping apps is to go to the source. Hit the retailer’s website on your mobile browser and look for a link to the app from their website. Likewise, stick to the legitimate app stores such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Both have measures in place to prevent malicious apps from appearing in their stores. Some can sneak through before being detected though, so look for the publisher’s name in the description and ensure it is legitimate. On a fake app, the name may be close to the retailer you’re looking for, but not quite right. Other signs of a fake will include typos, poor grammar, and design that looks a bit off.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) The “too good to be true” offer</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the heart of holiday shopping is scarcity. Special offers for a limited time, popular holiday items that are tough to find, and just the general preciousness of time during the season to get things done, like shopping. Scammers love this time of year. During the holidays, they’ll play on that scarcity and crunch you’re under in their offers and messaging. Enter the “too good to be true” offer, typically set up on phony sites like the ones mentioned above. If the pricing, availability, or delivery time all look too good to be true, it may be a scam designed to harvest your personal info and accounts. Use caution here before you click. If you’re unsure about a product or retailer, read reviews from trusted websites to help see if it’s legitimate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Great tips for shopping online any time</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Apart from spotting scams, there are several things you can do to keep yourself safer while shopping this holiday season. In fact, they can keep you safer when you shop year ‘round as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> Looking for a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html">last minute deal</a>? Download McAfee online protection today.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Look for the lock icon</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is a great one to start with. Secure websites begin their address with “https,” not just “http.” That extra “s” in stands for “secure,” which means that it uses a secure protocol for transmitting sensitive info like passwords, credit card numbers, and the like over the internet. It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use a credit card instead of your debit card</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Specific to the U.S., the Fair Credit Billing Act offers the public protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards, where citizens can dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly. Note that many credit card companies have their own policies that improve upon the Fair Credit Billing Act as well. However, debit cards aren’t afforded the same protection under the Act. Avoid using those while shopping online and use your credit card instead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Consider getting a virtual credit card</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another alternative is to set up a virtual credit card, which is a proxy for your actual credit card. With each purchase you make, that proxy changes, which then makes it much more difficult for hackers to exploit. You’ll want to research virtual credit cards further, as there are some possible cons that go along with the pros, such as in the case of returns where a retailer will want to use the same proxy to reimburse a purchase.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use protection while you shop</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>

Browser protection can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a financial scam. A password manager can create strong, unique passwords and store them securely as well, making it far more difficult for hackers to compromise your accounts. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Identity theft protection takes your safety a step further</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> by helping you secure your identity online and restore it should any of your personal info be found in the wrong hands.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of defense on top of your username and password. It adds in the use of a special one-time-use code to access your account, usually sent to you via email or to your phone by text or a phone call. In all, it combines something you know, like your password, with something you have, like your smartphone. Together, that makes it tougher for a crook to hack your account. If any of your accounts support two-factor authentication, the few extra seconds it takes to set up is more than worth the big boost in protection you’ll get.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Public Wi-Fi in coffee shops and other public locations can expose your private surfing to prying eyes because those networks are open to all. Using a virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your browsing, shopping, and other internet traffic, thus making it secure from attempts at intercepting your data on public Wi-Fi and harvesting information like your passwords and credit card numbers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all the passwords and accounts we keep, this is important. Checking your credit will uncover any inconsistencies or outright instances of fraud. From there, you can then take steps to straighten out any errors or bad charges that you find. In the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can run a free credit report once a year with the major credit reporting agencies</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Shop happy! (Don’t give in to stress and scarcity.)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while you’re shopping online this year, take a deep breath before you dive in. Double-check those deals that may look almost too good to be true. Look closely at those links. And absolutely don’t click on those attachments that look like shipping notices or coupon deals. Hackers are counting on you to be in a bit of a hurry this time of year. Taking an extra moment to spot their tricks can go a long way toward keeping you and your finances safe. Remember, stay ahead of cyber criminals, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html">get an extra layer of protection with McAfee</a> this holiday season.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Prediction: Self-reliant cybercrime groups will shift the balance of power within the RaaS eco-kingdom.</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>For several years, ransomware attacks have dominated the headlines as arguably the most impactful cyber threats. The <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-atr-analyzes-sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware-as-a-service-the-all-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model</a> at the time opened the cybercrime career path to lesser skilled criminals which eventually led to more breaches and higher criminal profits.</p>
<p>For a long time, RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, often neglecting the affiliates since they were perceived as less skilled. This, combined with the lack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesser-skilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals, eventually with a mind of their own.</p>
<p>In a response to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the popular cybercrime forums have banned ransomware actors from advertising. Now, the RaaS groups no longer have a third-party platform on which to actively recruit, show their seniority, offer escrow, have their binaries tested by moderators, or settle disputes. The lack of visibility has made it harder for RaaS groups to establish or maintain credibility and will make it harder for RaaS developers to maintain their current top tier position in the underground.</p>
<p>These events have undermined their trusted position. Ransomware has generated billions of dollars in recent years and it’s only a matter of time before more individuals who believe they aren’t getting their fair share become unhappy.</p>
<p>The first signs of this happening are already visible as described in our <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/how-groove-gang-is-shaking-up-the-ransomware-as-a-service-market-to-empower-affiliates/">blog</a> on the Groove Gang, a cyber-criminal gang that branched off from classic RaaS to specialize in computer network exploitation (CNE), exfiltrate sensitive data and, if lucrative, partner with a ransomware team to encrypt the organization’s network. McAfee Enterprise ATR believes, with high confidence, that the Groove gang is associated with the Babuk gang, either as a former affiliate or subgroup. These cybercriminals are happy to put aside previous Ransomware-as-a-Service hierarchies to focus on the ill-gotten gains to be made from controlling victim’s networks, rather than the previous approach which prioritized control of the ransomware itself.</p>
<p>Trust in a few things remains important even among cybercriminals underground, such as keeping your word and paying people what they deserve. Cybercriminals aren’t immune from feeling like employees whose contributions aren’t being adequately rewarded. When this happens, these bad actors cause problems within the organization. Ransomware has been generating billions of dollars in recent years and with revenue like that, it was inevitable that some individuals who believe they aren’t getting their fair share become unhappy and let the cybercrime world know it.</p>
<p>Recently, a former Conti affiliate was unhappy with their financial portion and decided to disclose the complete Conti attack playbook and their Cobalt Strike infrastructure online. In the past, McAfee ATR has been approached by individuals affiliated with certain RaaS groups expressing grudges with other RaaS members and admins, claiming they haven’t been paid in time or that their share wasn’t proportionate to the amount of work they put in.</p>
<p>In 2022, expect more self-reliant cybercrime groups to rise and shift the balance of power within the RaaS eco-climate from those who control the ransomware to those who control the victim’s networks.</p>
<h2><strong>Less-skilled Operators Won’t Have to Bend the Knee in RaaS Model Power Shift</strong></h2>
<p>The Ransomware-as-a-Service eco system has evolved with the use of affiliates, the middlemen and women that work with the developers for a share of the profits. While this structure was honed during the growth of GandCrab, we are witnessing potential chasms in what is becoming a not-so-perfect union.</p>
<p>Historically, the ransomware developers, held the cards, thanks to their ability to selectively determine the affiliates in their operations, even holding “job interviews” to establish technical expertise. Using <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/advanced-threat-research/">CTB locker</a> as an example, prominence was placed on affiliates generating sufficient installs via a botnet, exploit kits or stolen credentials. But affiliates recently taking on the role and displaying the ability to penetrate and compromise a complete network using a variety of malicious and non-malicious tools essentially changed the typical affiliate profile towards a highly skilled pen-tester/sysadmin.</p>
<p>The hierarchy of a conventional organized crime group often is described as a pyramid structure. Historically, La Cosa Nostra, drug cartels and outlaw motor gangs were organized in such a fashion. However, due to further professionalization and specialization of the logistics involved with committing crime, groups have evolved into more opportunistic network-based groups that will work together more fluidly, according to their current needs.</p>
<p>While criminals collaborating in the world of cybercrime isn’t new, a RaaS group’s hierarchy has been more rigid compared to other forms of cybercrime, due to the power imbalance between the group’s developers/admins and affiliates. But things are changing. RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, but often neglected the affiliates who they perceived to be less-skilled. This, combined with the lack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesser-skilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals.</p>
<p>As more ransomware players have entered the market, we suspect that the most talented affiliates are now able to auction their services for a bigger part of the profits, and maybe demand a broader say in operations. For example, the introduction of Active Directory enumeration within DarkSide ransomware could be intended to remove the dependency on the technical expertise of affiliates. These shifts signal a potential migration back to the early days of ransomware, with less-skilled operators increasing in demand using the expertise encoded by the ransomware developers.</p>
<p>Will this work? Frankly, it will be challenging to replicate the technical expertise of a skilled penetration tester, and maybe – just maybe – the impact will not be as severe as recent cases.</p>

This relatively unknown messaging and social media platform has risen from relative anonymity to become one of the biggest players in the ‘secret messaging’ business in less than a year. When What’s App changed its terms of usage in early 2021 and informed users that their data would be shared with their new parent Facebook, many ‘jumped ship’ in search of a less intrusive messaging option. But it was Facebook’s six-hour outage in early October that really made Telegram an enticing option. On that same day, </span><a href="https://t.me/durov/170" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Telegram gained a record 70 million users</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">According to Statista</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, Telegram is now the 10</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> most popular social media platform worldwide, coming in ahead of Snapchat, Pinterest, and even Twitter! So, as Telegram’s popularity continues to grow, it’s highly likely that your kids will be soon giving it a try if they haven’t already! So, how does it work? Is it safe? And, should you intervene. Here’s what you need to know…</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although many of us first heard about Telegram this year, it has in fact been around since 2013. Founded by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram was founded as part of their efforts to offer a forum for free speech online </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/31/5363990/how-putins-cronies-seized-control-over-russias-facebook-pavel-durov-vk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">after their first social networking site, known as VK, was taken over by the Russian Government</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Widely considered to be a Russian ‘Mark Zuckerberg’, VK made Pavel a billionaire. Pavel claims he was pushed out for refusing to provide VK data to the Russian government and shut down anti-corruption advocates. He has since cut ties with VK and moved to Germany. Telegram was last reported to be located in Dubai.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Does It Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All you need is the Telegram app and a mobile phone number to start your Telegram account and yes, it works across both the Apple and Android platforms. Although it was started primarily as a messaging app, it has evolved into a social network that can be used to build groups around common interests. Both public and private groups can be set up as well as channels. It is also possible to search for people located close to you. And if you love stickers then you’ll love Telegram. Many consider it to have the best range of any messaging app!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is It Safe?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Right from the start, Telegram has positioned itself as an app committed to private and secure messaging. However, the fact that end-to-end encryption is not automatically used on messages sent in Telegram means it is not as ‘secure’ as privacy focussed messaging platforms such as </span><a href="https://signal.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Signal</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> which offer end-to-end encryption for all communication. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is important to note that Telegram users can choose for their chats to be ‘secret’ which means they will be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that only the sender and receiver can read the message – but you must opt in to have the additional level of privacy. But group chats, one of the app’s most popular features, cannot be end-to-end encrypted.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Does Telegram Deal With Controversial Content?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the biggest issues with Telegram is the content shared in the app and the company’s &#8220;hands-off&#8221; approach to moderation. Telegram’s a truly unique combination of messaging and social media plus its publicly relaxed content moderation strategy means it attracts a certain style of the user who may have been outed from more mainstream online platforms.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A quick Google will produce multiple examples of how Telegram has been widely used by fringe political groups. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/30/15886506/terrorism-isis-telegram-social-media-russia-pavel-durov-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Security experts have acknowledged that Telegram is in fact ‘the app of choice’ for terrorist organizations. </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">Neo-nazi groups have reportedly used Telegram as a recruiting platform and the far-right QAnon has reportedly set up a home on Telegram after messaging app Parler was suspended earlier this year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, of course, this sounds completely horrid and makes Telegram seem very unattractive. But I can assure you that my Telegram user experience has been quite bland. I have been using the app on and off for several months now and I’ve never been exposed to political or fringe content but I also haven’t gone looking for it. For me, it has been yet another way of connecting with people in my life with a couple of great stickers to assist!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Should My Kids Use It?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, Telegram is an app best suited for a robust adult mind. According to the terms and conditions, Telegram users need to be 16+ to join up however as worldly parents, we all know those age restrictions are not a deterrent for many young people!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While my experience has been no different from using other messaging apps like WhatsApp, I believe Telegram is not an appropriate app for an under 18 as there are too many risks: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Note that this Squid Game cryptocurrency had no relationship to the show or to Netflix, aside from hijacking the Squid Game name without permission so that the scammers could use it as bait.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Squid Game scam: one of many cryptocurrency scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scams such as this are nothing new. Earlier this year, an “initial coin offering” (ICO) called Mando turned out to be a scam as well. Based on Disney’s popular Star Wars series, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">The Mandalorian</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, the scammers used the name and the Star Wars-themed imagery around it without permission. Then, just as suddenly they used the popular name to drum up investments in the ICO, </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-influencer-apologizes-after-promoting-scam-mando-1846596562" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the scammers disappeared with the money they garnered from the “pre-sale” of the bogus Mando cryptocurrency</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all the fervor around cryptocurrencies, scams associated with them are on the rise and have been for some time. </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/80-icos-are-scams-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A study published by Investopedia found that 80% of cryptocurrencies are scams</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and that only 8% of cryptocurrencies make their way onto legitimate trading exchanges.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of the Squid Game cryptocurrency, there were several apparent signs that it was bogus to begin with. Reports call out the fact that the currency was not available for purchase on mainstream platforms. Instead, investors could only purchase the cryptocurrency on a platform that doesn’t guarantee the transactions made upon it. Further, investors could only buy the currency, not sell it, effectively locking them in. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Other indications were found in the accompanying website and technical white paper, which were laden with spelling and grammatical errors, along with apparently unsubstantiated claims. In all, red flags such as those are very similar to the ones associated with phishing attacks—where scammers co-opt the identities of well-known brands and organizations in bogus emails and websites, albeit in an often-clumsy fashion. Errors like those are often a telltale sign that something sketchy is afoot.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself from cryptocurrency scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">1. Working with an accredited financial adviser is always a sound step with any investment you choose to make, as is only investing funds you can afford to lose if the investment falls through. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">2. Steer clear of cryptocurrency investments that ask you to contribute money directly from one of your own accounts rather than via </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a reliable platform that is verified</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">3. Consider dependable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin—of course recognizing </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/why-bitcoins-value-so-volatile.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">that even legitimate cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile investments</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">4. Regard any cryptocurrency based on a pop culture reference like movies, memes, and shows with a highly critical eye. It may very well be a scam built around buzz rather than an earnest attempt at launching a legitimate cryptocurrency, such as it was with the Squid Game scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The game where only the scammer are the winners</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just as Netflix’s </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> is one in a long string of hit shows that’ll capture our attention, we can count on a similarly long string of cryptocurrency scams to continue. In this case, the Squid Game cryptocurrency scam was rigged from the start, despite the warning signs. After all, an investment people can only buy into but never sell is scam, plain and simple. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Apache server version 2.4.50 (CVE-2021-42013)</em></p>
<h2>Why am I here?</h2>
<p>Regardless of the origins, you’ve arrived at Advanced Threat Research team’s monthly bug digest – an overview of what we believe to be the most noteworthy vulnerabilities over the last month. We don’t rely on a single scoring system like CVSS to determine what you need to know about; this is all about qualitative and experience-based analysis, relying on over 100 years of combined industry experience within our team. We look at characteristics such as wormability, ubiquity of the target, likelihood of exploitation and impact.  If you don’t agree with these picks, we encourage you to write a strongly worded letter to your local senator. In lieu of that, we present our top CVEs from the last month.</p>
<h3>Apache: CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013</h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br />
2 CVES / 1 Vuln – It appears Apache struggled a bit with this latest critical vulnerability, where it took two tries to fix a basic <strong>path traversal bug,</strong> which was introduced while patching last month’s <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSRF mod_proxy vulnerability</a>. As path traversal bugs do, this allows unauthorized users to access files outside the expected document root on the web server. But wait, there’s more! This can lead <strong>to remote code execution</strong> provided mod-cgi is enabled on the server.</p>
<p><strong>Who cares?</strong><br />
A quick Shodan scan told me there are at least 111,000 server admins that should care! With Apache being the <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second largest market</a> share holder of implemented webservers, there is a good chance your organization is using it somewhere. It’s always important to consider both internal and external facing assets when looking at your exposure. Apache is even commonly used as an embedded webserver to other applications and should be reviewed for use in any installed 3<sup>rd</sup> party applications. Oh yeah &#8211; and if you overlook an instance you have installed somewhere, this IS currently <strong>being actively exploited in the wild – no pressure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do?</strong><br />
Oh! I know, use Microsoft IIS! If you’re not ready to completely abandon your webserver implementation, I suggest updating to <strong>Apache 2.4.51</strong>. Remember to <strong>avoid version 2.4.50</strong> as it does not patch both vulnerabilities. If you have been an astute system admin and followed the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/access.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache documentation</a> using the <strong>default and pretty darn secure</strong> “require all denied” directive for all files outside the document root, kudos to you! Although patching is still highly recommended, you are not immediately vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>The Gold Standard</strong><br />
We recognize in some special cases patching is harder than compiling gcc from source, so McAfee Enterprise has you covered; we have been detecting path traversal attacks in our <strong>Network Security Platform (NSP)</strong> like it was going out of style since 1990 (and it was).</p>
<h3>Win32k Driver: CVE-2021-40449</h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br />
Ain’t nothin’ free anymore! Except kernel module addresses on your Windows machines, thanks to Microsoft Windows <a href="https://securelist.com/mysterysnail-attacks-with-windows-zero-day/104509/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-40449</a>. This vulnerability is a use-after-free in the NtGdiResetDC function of the Win32k driver and can lead to attackers being able to <strong>locally elevate their privileges</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who cares?</strong><br />
Are you currently reading this from a Microsoft Windows machine? Using Microsoft Server edition in your cloud? Local attacks are often given lower priority or downplayed. However, it is important to recognize that phishing attacks are still highly successfully as an initial point of entry, facilitating a need for privilege escalation bugs to obtain higher level access. So, unless you are a hardcore Linux and Mac-only shop, you may want to patch since this is <strong>actively being exploited</strong> by cybercriminals, according to our friends at <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mysterysnail-cve-2021-40449/42448/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaspersky</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do?</strong><br />
That boring <strong>Microsoft patch</strong> Tuesday thing still works, or you could just use a superior operating system like FreeBSD.</p>
<p><strong>The Gold Standard</strong><br />
Have you checked out the latest version of <strong>McAfee Enterprise ENS</strong> lately? Detecting exploitation and cybercriminal activity is sort of its thing, assuming you have grabbed the latest signatures.</p>
<h3>Apple iOS: CVE-2021-30883</h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br />
An <a href="https://saaramar.github.io/IOMFB_integer_overflow_poc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integer overflow</a> vulnerability in the iOS &#8220;IOMobileFrameBuffer&#8221; component can allow an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This has additionally been confirmed to be accessible from the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Who cares?</strong><br />
Since Apple still <a class="c-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">reportedly</a> holds 53% market share of all smartphone users, statistically speaking your organization should care too. It only takes one bad apple to hack your entire network, and with <a class="c-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846" data-sk="tooltip_parent">reported</a> <b data-stringify-type="bold">active exploitation</b> in the wild it might happen sooner than you think.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do?</strong><br />
You should be sensing a common theme in this section – and, in this case, you actually can take action! Stop reading this, plug that mobile device into a power source, and install <strong>the latest version of Apple iOS</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gold Standard</strong><br />
Since you stopped reading and updated already, congrats!</p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">For the Smart Home Supervisor</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The number of smart households (households that contain connected technology and can interact with other IoT devices) in the U.S. is expected to grow to</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/887611/number-of-smart-homes-in-the-smart-home-market-in-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> 77.05 million by 2025.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> That may not come as a surprise, since IoT devices have upped the convenience of tech users’ lives everywhere. Perhaps your spouse or parents love filling their home with the latest and greatest smart home gadgets.

Cybercriminals are also formulating ways to profit off the show’s popularity. </span><span data-contrast="none">According to the </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/beware-the-squid-game-app-installing-malware-onto-peoples-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">New York Post</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a malicious app based on </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> was recently found on the Google Play Store, infecting users’ devices with malware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Red Light: Joker Malware in Disguise</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span data-contrast="none">The app in question, called “Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD,” was one of the 200 </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none">-related apps on the Google Play Store. This particular app masqueraded as a place to download cool </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> backgrounds for Android devices. However, once a user downloaded the app, it infected their smartphone with a strain of Joker malware. </span><a href="https://medium.com/csis-techblog/analysis-of-joker-a-spy-premium-subscription-bot-on-googleplay-9ad24f044451" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Joker malware</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> is a type of billing fraud malware that usually disguises itself as a messenger, photo editor, camera, or in this case, wallpaper apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You may wonder how an app like this even ends up on a legitimate app purchasing store. In order to bypass Google Play’s app review process, Joker malware hides its malicious payload during the review process. This means that when the app is published in the Google Play Store, there’s no sign of malware. It’s only when a user installs the app that the malware downloads the malicious payload. Once the malware successfully installs itself, it secretly signs the user up for premium subscriptions, intercepts all their SMS messages, and can upload all their contacts to the malware operators. </span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The “Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD” app received 5,000 downloads before it was removed from the Google Play Store. It’s likely that cybercriminals will continue to </span><span data-contrast="auto">use the show’s popularity to exploit its fans</span><span data-contrast="none"> and make a profit, whether that be through malicious apps disguised as a place where viewers can watch the show or fraudulent websites selling </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> merchandise. But fear not! There are steps you can take to help ensure that you steer clear of malware: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Avoid third-party app stores</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Unlike Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe, third-party sites may not have that process in place. In fact, some third-party sites may intentionally host malicious apps as part of a broader scam. However, cybercriminals have found ways to work around Google and Apple’s review process (such as with “Squid Game Wallpaper 4K HD”), but the chances of downloading a safe app from these stores are far greater than anywhere else. Additionally, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps once discovered.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Before you download a new app, do some quick research. Check out the developer. Have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has several reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of fake five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and grammatical errors in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

In this blog, we take a deeper dive into the continuingly aggressive role Nation States will play in 2022.</p>
<h2><strong>Prediction: Lazarus Wants to Add You as a Friend</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By Raj Samani</strong></p>
<p>We love our social media. From beefs between popstars and professional pundits, to an open channel to the best jobs in the industry.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>The threat actors know this, and our appetite toward accepting connections from people we have never met are all part of our relentless pursuit of the next 1,000 followers.</p>
<p>A result of this has seen the targeting of executives with promises of job offers from specific threat groups; and why not? After all, it is the most efficient method to bypass traditional security controls and directly communicate with targets at companies that are of interest to threat groups. Equally, direct messages have been used by groups to take control over influencer accounts to promote messaging of their own.</p>
<p>While this approach is not new, it is nearly as ubiquitous as alternate channels. After all, it does demand a level of research to “hook” the target into interactions and establishing fake profiles are more work than simply finding an open relay somewhere on the internet. That being said, targeting individuals has proven a very successful channel, and we predict the use of this vector could grow not only through espionage groups, but other threat actors looking to infiltrate organizations for their own criminal gain.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impacts &amp; Implications </strong><br />
The potential impacts and implications for an executive or company that had their social media channels targeted by threat actors are endless. We began to see some nation state groups using platforms like LinkedIn to target executives, more specifically targeting the defense and aerospace industry. For years we’ve been accepting connections on LinkedIn to expand our network and threat actors are using this to their advantage with job adverts. Threat actors will find the executive they want to target in the company they want to go after and develop profiles that look like legitimate recruiters. By getting an executive on the hook, they could potentially convince them to download a job spec that is malware. These types of espionage campaigns can be carried out by other social networks as well, including Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Techniques &amp; Tactics </strong><br />
In the past, fake social profiles were relatively easy to spot, however in the case of DPRK, the cybercriminals spent time to setting up a profile, get hooked up into the infosec scene, gain followers and connections through LinkedIn, making it more difficult than before to detect a fraudulent account. When threat actors weaponize social media, they use techniques and tactics you see in the legitimate world. They diligently do their research into what types of jobs would be of interest to you and share an offer that will require you to open a document and trick you to carry out some type of action that will have you download malicious content onto your device.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Regulate?</strong><br />
We live in a world where we are governed by rules, territories, and jurisdictions; to hold a threat actor accountable, we would need digital evidence. We need to use regulations for digital investigations, and the bad guys don’t. While in territories where there isn’t an extradition treaty, threat actors can continue their malicious behaviors without any consequences. Unfortunately, cybercrime has nonrepudiation and threat actors can deny all knowledge and get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong><br />
Cybercrime will always be an issue and we need to be more aware of what threat actors are doing and what they’re after. It’s important to understand the threat and what is happening. At McAfee Enterprise and FireEye we work to track malicious actors and integrate intelligence into our products and make content available for CISO, CEO etc. to know what to do and what to look for in the event they are targeted.</p>
<h2><strong>Prediction: Help Wanted: Bad Guys with Benefits</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By Christiaan Beek</strong></p>
<p>With a focus on strategic intelligence, our team is not only monitoring activity, but also investigating and monitoring open-source-intelligence from a diversity of sources to gain more insights into threat-activities around the globe – and these include an increase in the blending of cybercrime and nation-state operations.</p>
<p>In many cases, a start-up company is formed, and a web of front companies or existing “technology” companies are involved in operations that are directed and controlled by the countries’ intelligence ministries.</p>
<p>In May 2021 for example, the U.S. government charged four Chinese nationals who were working for state-owned front companies. The front-companies facilitated hackers to create malware, attack targets of interest to gain business intelligence, trade-secrets, and information about sensitive technologies.</p>
<p>Not only China but also other nations such as Russia, North Korea, and Iran have applied these tactics. Hire hackers for operations, do not ask questions about their other operations if they do not harm the interests of their own country.</p>
<p>Where in the past specific malware families were tied to nation-state groups, the blurring starts to happen when hackers are hired to write code and conduct these operations.</p>
<p>The initial breach with tactics and tools could be similar as “regular” cybercrime operations, however it is important to monitor what is happening next and act fast. With the predicted increase of blurring between cybercrime and nation-state actors in 2022, companies should audit their visibility and learn from tactics and operations conducted by actors targeting their sector.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impacts &amp; Implications </strong><br />
With more tools at their disposal, nation state actors are reshaping the cyberthreat landscape leaving destruction and disrupted operations in their wake. There have been many accusations of “spying” which poses as a major threat to economic and national security. The main aim of these attacks is to obtain intellectual property or business intelligence. We are seeing nation states devoting a significant number of resources, time and energy toward achieving strategic cyber advantages, resulting in the implications of divulging national interests, intelligence-gathering capabilities, and military strength through espionage, disruption and theft.</p>
<p><strong>Techniques &amp; Tactics </strong><br />
In May 2021 incident where four Chinese nationals were charged in a global hacking campaign; the indictment stated the threat actors used a front company to hide the Chinese government&#8217;s role in the information theft. We anticipate nation states will continue to team up with cybercriminals and create front companies to hide involvement and gain access to private information, military tactics, trade secrets and more. Adversaries will leverage techniques like phishing, known vulnerabilities, malware, crimeware and more to attain their goal.</p>
<p>On the blending of cybercrime/nation-state; understanding the functionalities of malware becomes more important than ever. Let me give an example, when you get a Trickbot infection, a part of the code will steal credentials, they could be sold to a ransomware crew with a possible ransomware attack as result, a complete cybercrime operation. But what if the Trickbot infection was ordered by a Nation State, the credentials are used for a long time operation; started as a crime, ends as a long APT.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Regulate?</strong><br />
It’s important for governments to hold actors accountable for cyber incidents. Government entities and researchers can likely assist public and private sector organizations in navigating this new cyber landscape by developing standards and/or template processes to drive cyber defense and maintaining operational resiliency.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong><br />
A threat actor’s goal is to gain access to data they can sell, leverage for ransom, or gain critical knowledge so it is important to properly encrypt critical data, rendering it unusable to unauthorized users. You should also maintain regular, offline backups and have an incident response plan ready. Maintaining and testing offline backups can similarly mitigate the impact of destructive malware.</p>

It’s a fair question. And the quick answer is this: the more you use social media, the more those companies likely know.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The moment you examine the question more closely, the answer takes on greater depth. Consider how much we use social media for things other than connecting with friends. While that was the original intent behind social networks, the role of social media has since evolved into something far more expansive. We use it to get our news, stay up to date on when artists will drop a new release, and sometimes reach out for customer service on a company’s social media page. In some cases, </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/is-it-safe-to-use-facebook-to-login-on-other-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">we use our social media accounts to log into other sites and apps</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://pay.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">we even make payments through social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, all of those likes, taps, clicks, links, and time spent reading or watching videos can add up and paint a detailed picture of who you are.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Why are they collecting all this information? Largely, it’s for two reasons:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">1. To make improvements to their platform, by better understanding your behavior and ways you like to use their service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">2. To create an exacting user profile that advertisers can use for targeting ads that they think will interest you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s the exchange in play here. You use the company’s social media service for free, and in return, they gain rights to gather specific information about you, which you consent to by agreeing to their terms of service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s get into the details of what social media companies may collect and know about you—along with ways you can limit the data and information they gather.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">(Some of) the things social media companies may know about you</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Different social media platforms have different user agreements that cover what types of information they collect and use. For starters, we’ll speak broadly about social media companies in general, and then we’ll weave in a few specific examples along the way. Generally, they may know:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

This can extend to other identifiers like IP addresses, unique device ID numbers, connection type, connection speed, your network, other devices on your network. Also, device behavior can get tracked as well. That may include whether a window is open in the foreground or background and what mouse and finger taps you make while using the service. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

All of it builds up a profile with increasing levels of detail the more you engage with others and as they engage with you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

The more you interact, the more likely you are to have a strong connection to certain topics and opinions—and subsequently, social media companies may suggest similar content that they believe you will engage with just as strongly. </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">For example, Facebook puts it this way on their privacy page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (as of October 2021): </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities.</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction.

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By the way, none of this is secret. What I’ve listed here can be found by simply reading the terms of use posted by various social media companies. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Note that these terms of use can and do change</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Checking up on them regularly will help you understand what is being collected and how it may be used.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, what you write and post says a lot about you too</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This nearly goes without saying, yet another layer of data and information collection comes by way of the pictures and updates you post. Per Instagram (as of October 2021): </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another consideration is how the content you interact with on </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">other sites </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">may be shared with social media companies in return. Some social media companies partner with other third parties to gather this data, which is used to round out your user profile in yet more detail. That information can include purchases you made, how often you visited that third party’s site, and so on.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of Facebook, they refer to this as “</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list"><span data-contrast="none">Off-Facebook Activity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.” In their words: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">Off-Facebook activity includes information that businesses and organizations share with us about your interactions with them.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The good news here is that </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/facebook-gets-info-about-you-from-other-web-sites-how-to-stop-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can take control of the Off-Facebook Activity setting with a few clicks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No doubt about it, the content you create and interact with, both on the social media sites and sometimes off of them as well, can generate information about you that’s collected by social media companies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Limiting what social media companies know about you</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Short of deleting your accounts altogether, there are several things you can do to take control and limit the amount of information you share.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. You can access, update, correct, move, and erase your data, depending on the platform.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, you can visit your </span><a href="https://facebook.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook Settings</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/privacy_and_security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Instagram Settings</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/settings/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Twitter Settings</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which each gives you options for managing your information—or download it and even delete it from their platform outright if you wish. (Note that this will likely only delete data associated with your account. Content you posted or shared with other people on their accounts will remain.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Disable location sharing.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As noted above, this isn’t an absolute fix because social media companies can infer your location other ways. Yet taking this step gives them one less piece of exacting information about you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Review your privacy and account settings.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Each platform will have its own settings and options, so give them a look. Here, you can determine which information advertisers are allowed to use to serve up ads to you, set rules for facial recognition, enable or disable location history, and much more. If possible, do this from your computer or laptop rather than your smartphone. Often, the account controls that you can access from a computer browser are far more comprehensive than the ones in a mobile app.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Consider using other messaging platforms.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Using direct messaging on social media platforms may tell social media companies even more about you and who you interact with. When possible, think about using text messaging instead or other means of communication that aren’t tied to a social media company.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some apps and sites will allow you to use your social media login instead of creating a new one. While convenient, this can provide the social media company with more information about you. Additionally, if your social media account is compromised, it could compromise the other accounts that are tied to it as well. Check your settings and look for “Apps and Websites” to see what’s connected to your social media account, what’s being shared, and how you can disable it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The very nature of social media is sharing and exchanging. That’s the draw it has—the way it keeps us connected to the people, pastimes, and things we care about. Yet that exchange runs deeper. In return for using these free services, social media companies collect information on us which they use to improve their platforms and generate revenue. It’s all there for you to see in the various terms of use associated with your social media accounts. In short, using social media means sharing information about yourself with social media companies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>Ransomware, nation states, social media and the shifting reliance on a remote workforce made headlines in 2021. Bad actors will learn from this year’s successful tactics, retool, and pivot them into next year’s campaigns wielding the potential to wreak more havoc in all our lives.</p>
<p>Skilled engineers and security architects from McAfee Enterprise and FireEye offer a preview of how the threatscape might look in 2022 and how these new or evolving threats could potentially impact the security of enterprises, countries, and civilians.</p>
<p>“Over this past year, we have seen cybercriminals get smarter and quicker at retooling their tactics to follow new bad actor schemes – from ransomware to nation states – and we don’t anticipate that changing in 2022,” said Raj Samani, fellow and chief scientist of the combined company. “With the evolving threat landscape and continued impact of the global pandemic, it is crucial that enterprises stay aware of the cybersecurity trends so that they can be proactive and actionable in protecting their information.”</p>
<h3>Lazarus Wants to Add You as a Friend</h3>
<p><strong>Nation States will weaponize social media to target more enterprise professionals</strong></p>
<p><em>By Raj Samani</em></p>
<p>We love our social media. From beefs between popstars and professional pundits, to an open channel to the best jobs in the industry.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>The threat actors know this, and our appetite toward accepting connections from people we have never met are all part of our relentless pursuit of the next 1,000 followers.</p>
<p>A result of this has seen the targeting of executives with promises of job offers from specific threat groups; and why not? After all, it is the most efficient method to bypass traditional security controls and directly communicate with targets at companies that are of interest to threat groups. Equally, direct messages have been used by groups to take control over influencer accounts to promote messaging of their own.</p>
<p>While this approach is not new, it is nearly as ubiquitous as alternate channels. After all, it does demand a level of research to “hook” the target into interactions and establishing fake profiles are more work than simply finding an open relay somewhere on the internet. That being said, targeting individuals has proven a very successful channel, and we predict the use of this vector could grow not only through espionage groups, but other threat actors looking to infiltrate organizations for their own criminal gain.</p>
<h3>Help Wanted: Bad Guys with Benefits</h3>
<p><strong>Nation states will increase their offensive operations by leveraging cybercriminals</strong></p>
<p><em>By Christiaan Beek</em></p>
<p>With a focus on strategic intelligence, our team is not only monitoring activity, but also investigating and monitoring open-source-intelligence from a diversity of sources to gain more insights into threat-activities around the globe – and these include an increase in the blending of cybercrime and nation-state operations.</p>
<p>In many cases, a start-up company is formed, and a web of front companies or existing “technology” companies are involved in operations that are directed and controlled by the countries’ intelligence ministries.</p>
<p>In May 2021 for example, the U.S. government charged four Chinese nationals who were working for state-owned front companies. The front-companies facilitated hackers to create malware, attack targets of interest to gain business intelligence, trade-secrets, and information about sensitive technologies.</p>
<p>Not only China but also other nations such as Russia, North Korea, and Iran have applied these tactics. Hire hackers for operations, do not ask questions about their other operations if they do not harm the interests of their own country.<br />
Where in the past specific malware families were tied to nation-state groups, the blurring starts to happen when hackers are hired to write code and conduct these operations.</p>
<p>The initial breach with tactics and tools could be similar as “regular” cybercrime operations, however it is important to monitor what is happening next and act fast. With the predicted increase of blurring between cybercrime and nation-state actors in 2022, companies should audit their visibility and learn from tactics and operations conducted by actors targeting their sector.</p>
<h3>Game of Ransomware Thrones</h3>
<p><strong>Self-reliant cybercrime groups will shift the balance of power within the RaaS eco-kingdom</strong></p>
<p><em>By John Fokker</em></p>
<p>For several years, ransomware attacks have dominated the headlines as arguably the most impactful cyber threats. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model at the time opened the cybercrime career path to lesser skilled criminals which eventually led to more breaches and higher criminal profits.</p>
<p>For a long time, RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, often neglecting the affiliates since they were perceived as less skilled. This, combined with the lack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesser-skilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals, eventually with a mind of their own.</p>
<p>In a response to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the popular cybercrime forums have banned ransomware actors from advertising. Now, the RaaS groups no longer have a third-party platform on which to actively recruit, show their seniority, offer escrow, have their binaries tested by moderators, or settle disputes. The lack of visibility has made it harder for RaaS groups to establish or maintain credibility and will make it harder for RaaS developers to maintain their current top tier position in the underground.</p>
<p>These events undermine their trusted position. Ransomware has generated billions of dollars in recent years and it’s only a matter of time before some individuals who believe they aren’t getting their fair share become unhappy.</p>
<p>The first signs of this happening are already visible as described in our blog on the Groove Gang, a cyber-criminal gang that branched off from classic RaaS to specialize in computer network exploitation (CNE), exfiltrate sensitive data and, if lucrative, partner with a ransomware team to encrypt the organization’s network.</p>
<p>In 2022, expect more self-reliant cybercrime groups to rise and shift the balance of power within the RaaS eco-climate from those who control the ransomware to those who control the victim’s networks.</p>
<h3>Ransomware For Dummies</h3>
<p><strong>Less-skilled operators won’t have to bend the knee in RaaS model power shift</strong></p>
<p><em>By Raj Samani</em></p>
<p>The Ransomware-as-a-Service eco system has evolved with the use of affiliates, the middlemen and women that work with the developers for a share of the profits. While this structure was honed during the growth of GandCrab, we are witnessing potential chasms in what is becoming a not-so-perfect union.</p>
<p>Historically, the ransomware developers, held the cards, thanks to their ability to selectively determine the affiliates in their operations, even holding “job interviews” to establish technical expertise. As more ransomware players have entered the market, we suspect that the most talented affiliates are now able to auction their services for a bigger part of the profits, and maybe demand a broader say in operations. For example, the introduction of Active Directory enumeration within DarkSide ransomware could be intended to remove the dependency on the technical expertise of affiliates. These shifts signal a potential migration back to the early days of ransomware, with less-skilled operators increasing in demand using the expertise encoded by the ransomware developers.</p>
<p>Will this work? Frankly, it will be challenging to replicate the technical expertise of a skilled penetration tester, and maybe – just maybe – the impact will not be as severe as recent cases.</p>
<h3>Keep A Close Eye on API</h3>
<p><strong>5G and IoT traffic between API services and apps will make them increasingly lucrative targets</strong></p>
<p><em>By Arnab Roy</em></p>
<p>Threat actors pay attention to enterprise statistics and trends, identifying services and applications offering increased risk potential. Cloud applications, irrespective of their flavor (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS), have transformed how APIs are designed, consumed, and leveraged by software developers, be it a B2B scenario or B2C scenario. The reach and popularity of some of these cloud applications, as well as, the treasure trove of business-critical data and capabilities that typically lie behind these APIs, make them a lucrative target for threat actors. The connected nature of APIs potentially also introduces additional risks to businesses as they become an entry vector for wider supply chain attacks.</p>
<p>The following are some of the key risks that we see evolving in the future:</p>
<p>1. Misconfiguration of APIs<br />
2. Exploitation of modern authentication mechanisms<br />
3. Evolution of traditional malware attacks to use more of the cloud APIs<br />
4. Potential misuse of the APIs to launch attacks on enterprise data<br />
5. The usage of APIs for software-defined infrastructure also means potential misuse.</p>
<p>For developers, developing an effective threat model for their APIs and having a Zero Trust access control mechanism should be a priority alongside effective security logging and telemetry for better incident response and detection of malicious misuse.</p>
<h3>Hijackers Will Target Your Application Containers</h3>
<p><strong>Expanded exploitation of containers will lead to endpoint resource takeovers</strong></p>
<p><em>By Mo Cashman</em></p>
<p>Containers have become the de facto platform of modern cloud applications. Organizations see benefits such as portability, efficiency and speed which can decrease time to deploy and manage applications that power innovation for the business. However, the accelerated use of containers increases the attack surface for an organization. Which techniques should you look out for, and which container risk groups will be targeted? Exploitation of public-facing applications (MITRE T1190) is a technique often used by APT and Ransomware groups. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) identified multiple container risk groups including Image, Orchestrator, Registry, Container, Host OS and Hardware.</p>
<p>The following are some of the key risks groups we anticipate will be targeted for expanded exploitation in the future:</p>
<p>1. Orchestrator Risks: Increasing attacks on the orchestration layer, such as Kubernetes and associated API mainly driven by misconfigurations.<br />
2. Image or Registry Risk: Increasing use of malicious or backdoored images through insufficient vulnerability checks.<br />
3. Container Risks: Increasing attacks targeting vulnerable applications.</p>
<p>Expanded exploitation of the above vulnerabilities in 2022 could lead to endpoint resource hijacking through crypto-mining malware, spinning up other resources, data theft, attacker persistence, and container-escape to host systems.</p>
<h3>Zero Cares About Zero-days</h3>
<p><strong>The time to repurpose vulnerabilities into working exploits will be measured in hours and there’s nothing you can do about it… except patch</strong></p>
<p><em>By Fred House</em></p>
<p>2021 is already being touted as one of the worst years on record with respect to the volume of zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in the wild. The scope of these exploitations, the diversity of targeted applications, and ultimately the consequences to organizations were all notable. As we look to 2022, we expect these factors to drive an increase in the speed at which organizations respond.</p>
<p>When we first learned in 2020 that roughly 17,000 SolarWinds customers were compromised and an estimated 40 were subsequently targeted, many reacted in shock at the pure scope of the compromise. Unfortunately, 2021 brought its own notable increase in volume along with uninspiring response times by organizations. Case in point: two weeks after Microsoft patched ProxyLogon they reported that 30K Exchange servers were still vulnerable (less conservative estimates had the number at 60K).</p>
<p>ProxyShell later arrived as Exchange’s second major event of the year. In August, a Blackhat presentation detailing Exchange Server vulnerabilities was followed the next day by the release of an exploit POC, all of which had been patched by Microsoft months earlier in April/May. This analysis of data captured by Shodan one week after the exploit POC was released concluded that over 30K Exchange servers were still vulnerable, noting that the data may have underrepresented the full scope (i.e., Shodan hadn’t had time to scan the full Internet). In summary: patched in the Spring, exploited in the Fall.</p>
<p>So, what can we take away from all of this? Well, attackers and security researchers alike will continue to hone their craft until weaponized exploits and POCs are expected within hours of vulnerability disclosure. In turn however, and largely driven by the increased consequences of compromise, we can also expect renewed diligence around asset and patch management. From identifying public facing assets to quickly deploying patches despite potential business disruption, companies will have a renewed focus on reducing their “time to patch.” While we will inevitably continue to see high-impact exploitations, the scope of these exploitations will be reduced as more organizations get back to the basics.</p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">What is Ransomware?</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ransomware is a form of extortion that happens when cyber criminals demand payment. Recently some high-profile companies have been in the news as victims of major ransomware attacks. However, ransomware also impacts individuals, just like you and me. In the individual’s case, a cybercriminal may demand payment to restore access to your device or data or even to prevent them from dumping sensitive or embarrassing information onto the internet. McAfee defends consumers from tens of thousands of ransomware attacks every month.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="169" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373-300x169.jpeg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373-205x115.jpeg 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SASE04-iStock-1195775373.jpeg 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Cybersecurity detection is a criminal investigation. Cybercrime investigators are experts who are in limited supply.  Sometimes their hunt begins while an intrusion is in process, but more often than not, it occurs after the attack when a crime has occurred. The investigation is taunting and less glamorous, realizing that it can take an average of 228 days even to identify the breach<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>.</p>
<p>At that point, you’re looking to find out what your adversaries have seen or stolen, you want to plug the holes that enabled the hack and kick out or remove the adversary completely. Figure on an average of 80 days to resolve and contain a breach. Meanwhile, your adversary spends the epic dwell time in your environment to monitor your traffic and behavior before determining their next move.</p>
<p>Do the math on that exercise and, unless you have generous funding, you may conclude that your resources stretch further by focusing on prevention rather than detection. While eliminating detection may not be practical, you can at least realign your spending and shore up your prevention efforts with enhanced actionable information.</p>
<p>Several things have happened to make this shift possible. First, detection is now often automated and highly productive. Second, advance warning is better than ever. You can apply predictive analytics to leverage in-depth threat intelligence sources to produce real-time, automated assessments of your security posture risks from device to cloud.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130720" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-3.png" alt="" width="936" height="408" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-3.png 936w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-3-300x131.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-3-768x335.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-3-205x89.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Proactive Threat Hunting</strong></h2>
<p>Making the shift from detection to prevention didn’t happen overnight for the Service public de Wallonie (SPW), the public administration arm of the French-speaking regional government of Wallonia in Belgium. SPW’s endpoint security team oversees 9,000 desktops, 1,300 servers, and 1,000 applications used by more than 8,000 employees.</p>
<p>When SPW implemented MVISION Insights, the security team sought to identify potential threats lurking outside the agency’s perimeter. Using data gathered from one billion sensors globally that have been distilled and analyzed by artificial intelligence and human experts, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/insights-preview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION Insights</a> provides comprehensive risk intelligence filtered for a specific industry and geography. It helps SPW’s security team to prioritize which threats and campaigns are most likely to target them.</p>
<p>Before making this shift, SPW’s team regularly spent hours checking out various security sites, lab reports, and news articles to track the latest threat campaigns. After deploying MVISION Insights, the same result arrived in seconds or minutes. Now they’re engaging in more proactive threat hunting and attack prevention by tapping into predictive assessments and adjusting their posture accordingly.</p>
<h2><strong>A Change of Posture</strong></h2>
<p>Organizations such as SPW illustrate that playing both offense and defense becomes necessary to reduce time-to-detect and dwell time. Detection is difficult for several reasons, most notably the deluge of advanced persistent threats (APTs). And it’s also complicated by the cost of threat hunting talent, given the current shortage of cybersecurity expertise.</p>
<p>These days there’s such an overwhelming amount of security data pouring into data lakes that manually aggregating and analyzing it to make sense of anything requires a fair amount of threat expertise. Then there’s the time it takes to triage and determine the following steps to thwart an attack. By the time you’re analyzing this data, at best, you’re in a reactive state with limited visibility and understanding of your local environment.</p>
<p>One effective way to streamline that process is to apply the proven MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework, which provides an excellent knowledge base to help with threat hunting and detection. We use that framework to better inform <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/xdr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION XDR</a> powered by MVISION Insights, for example. As we <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/endpoint-security/5-ways-mvision-xdr-innovates-with-mitre-attck-%e2%80%af/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned in March</a>, we align XDR with MITRE to greatly expand the depth of our investigation, threat detection, and prevention capabilities to prevent the attack chain with relevant insights.</p>
<h2><strong>Meet the Proactive Evolution Series to Help Become More Preventive </strong></h2>
<p>In our leading role in the cybersecurity community, we gather a lot of intelligence and invest considerable time curating content to ensure that what we share is timely, accurate, and valuable. This is reflected in MVISION Insights with over 1000 threat campaign profiles. If you place MVISION Insights in your environment it goes beyond threat intelligence.  You also gain prioritized threat insights on a likely attack targeting you, where your gaps are and what you can do. Introducing our new Proactive Evolution series to get regular information on how to become more preventive and protective with LinkedIn Live discussions, blog posts, and other intelligence from our cybersecurity expert contributors highlighting the power of MVISION Insights.</p>
<p>This new Proactive Evolution Series features helpful content intended for managing or building security operations to be more effective and preventive or for a CISO who wants to stay on top of changing best practices.</p>
<p>Detection is often done in reaction to an attack or a looming threat. Not every organization can do both detection and prevention equally well. That’s usually because they lack dedicated or experienced threat hunters or suitable detection technologies. By shifting your efforts to a proactive prevention strategy, you’re boosting your chances to harden your systems before an attack.</p>

That’s easy to lose sight of. After all, cybercrime can feel a little anonymous, like a computer is doing the attacking instead of a person. Yet people are indeed behind these attacks, and over the years they’ve been getting organized—where cybercriminals structure and run their operations in ways that darkly mirror the workings of a real business.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Funny, the notion of hackers running an illegal business just like a regular business. But there you go. What works, apparently works. So, let’s take a closer look at how organized crime goes about its business—and get a little more insight into how we can protect ourselves in the process.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A classic notion of the cybercriminal is that of a lone hacker, donning a hoodie in a dimly lit room and chipping away at the networks and devices of a business or household. That does happen, such as in the case of the former engineer accused of</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Yet increasingly, attacks are orchestrated efforts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">More and more of </span><a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/internet-organised-crime-threat-assessment-iocta-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">today’s cybercrime is a distributed, international affair that relies on several bad actors to see it through</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This takes the form of organized crime groups with ringleaders located in one country and developers in others, further supported by operations, marketing, finance, and call center teams in yet other locations—just like a legitimate business, strange as it seems.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What does that look like in real life? Consider a practical example: an identity theft ring sets up a series of phony websites to hijack personal information. There’s a lot of work that goes into putting up those websites, so let’s start there and see who could be involved. From there, we can work our way up the chain of cybercrime organizations. For starters:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">There are the sites themselves. An individual or team codes the site in their location and then hosts them on servers in other locations, often different countries.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">There’s a creative team that designed and wrote the sites in such a way that they look convincing enough to potential victims such that they fall for the scam. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Another team takes on a marketing role, where they’re charged with promoting those phony sites to lure in victims through phony emails, ads, and paid search results designed to look like the real thing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="5" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">An analytics team determines which lures are the most effective. From there, they share these findings so that the most effective of the phony emails, ads, and search results get used—they may fine-tune the phony websites for performance as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s just for starters. There’s plenty of activity that follows once victims share their personal info on that phony site, spanning yet more business roles:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">A data team harvests the stolen data and packages it up for use, whether by the same cybercrime organization or via sale on a dark web marketplace.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">A finance team that handles and launders funds as needed—and then pays out partners, employees, and ringleaders of the organization. Plus, it will cover any operational costs like equipment and services used.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">A managerial layer may also exist to keep operations running smoothly, coordinating the efforts of all the teams and offering reports to (ring)leadership.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">The ringleaders themselves—the ones who conceived this scam, set it in motion, and reap the big dollars from it. Of note, these people may not be technically minded at all. But they are crooks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Stepping back and looking at this example, you can see how there are several distinct skillsets at play here. While small groups of hackers could pull off something similar, the most effective of these scams will have a relatively large staff in place to ensure it runs effectively. This is just one broad example, yet it does serve to remind us that sophisticated cybercrime can have a sophisticated organization behind it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Other examples include </span><a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2021/international-tech-support-scam-exposed.html"><span data-contrast="none">tech support scams that run their own call support centers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, corporate ransomware attacks where scammers hijack the company’s social media accounts and shame them into paying. There are yet more examples of bogus call centers, like the ones that will walk individual victims through the process of paying off a ransomware attack with cryptocurrency. Once again, quite an operation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Back to the lone hacker in a hoodie for a moment. They’re still out there. In fact, many of them are enabled by larger cybercrime organizations. This can happen in several ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Take the phony website example above. The crooks who stole that information may not use it themselves. They may sell it to other cyber crooks for profit instead. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, larger organizations will sell their malicious code in kits to non-technical and semi-technical hackers so that those crooks can commit crimes of their own. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="·" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Some organized cybercrime organizations will simply hire themselves out as a service, unleashing phony website scams like mentioned above, distributed denial of service attacks that flood internet traffic to a halt, and several other types of crime—for the right price. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s a marketplace out there, where our data acts as a kind of currency that’s traded and sold by operators large and small.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So yes, there’s a person behind every cybercrime. And then there’s you. Along with all things you can do to stop them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier this year, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-new-mcafee-a-bold-new-world-of-protection-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">I shared how McAfee now solely focuses on people</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Organized cybercrime is just one of the many reasons why. While different devices may come and go in our lives, our data always follows us—the very things cybercriminals are after. It’s people who need protection. By protecting you, your identity, and your privacy, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">along with</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> your devices, we protect you from threats like these, whether they stem from a small-time crook or an organized crime gang. Even lone hackers in hoodies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To me, the solution looks something like this: you’re out there enjoying the internet without having to look over your shoulder. You’re just safe. And living your life. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So as cybercrime becomes more sophisticated, we’re becoming yet more sophisticated at McAfee. And it’s you entirely with you in mind. Online protection should come naturally and give you the confidence to go about your day—protection that is personalized, intelligent, and easier to use so that it adapts based on what you’re doing and what you need at any given moment. That’s our aim. Ease. Freedom. Particularly in a time when criminals are trying their hardest to make you their business as you go about yours.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

While originally proposed as fully unified architecture delivering network and security capabilities, the reality soon dawned that enterprise transition to a complete SASE model would be a decade long journey due to factors such as existing investments, operational silos (customer), and vendor consolidation. Consequently, Gartner introduced a new two-vendor approach to SASE that brought together a highly converged WAN Edge Infrastructure platform alongside a highly converged security platform – known as Security Service Edge (SSE).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130636" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-2.png" alt="" width="904" height="391" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-2.png 904w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-2-300x130.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-2-768x332.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-2-205x89.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: SASE convergence.</em></p>
<p>SSE brings together <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/cloud/what-is-secure-web-gateway.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Web Gateway (SWG)</a>, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/cloud/what-is-a-casb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)</a>, and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/cloud/what-is-ztna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</a> to secure access to the web, cloud services, and private applications, resulting in reduced risk, cost and complexity. McAfee Enterprise has long been a proponent of this approach: we embarked on a project to build the industry’s best SASE security solution over three years ago, introduced our <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/unified-cloud-edge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION Unified Cloud Edge</a> solution in early 2020, and have since continued to innovate and set the standard for the Security Service Edge space.</p>
<h2><strong><u>How Did We Get Here?</u></strong></h2>
<p>The fundamental problem that SSE sets out to solve is that enterprises must adequately secure their personnel and their data. This became increasingly difficult as digital transformation spurred widespread cloud adoption and empowered remote and mobile workers. Just a few short years ago we would talk about remote access for short periods of time due to travel, and typically for a small proportion of the workforce. Today we speak in the context of COVID-19 and a vast, permanent “Work From Anywhere” (WFA) cultural shift. Supporting this shift is an accelerated migration into the cloud, where the vast majority of workloads and applications will soon reside.</p>
<p>All of this has taken down the walls that formed the perimeter we relied on heavily in the past. Today our people and our data are outside of that perimeter but inside of cloud applications. Cloud applications run from many locations, sometimes around the globe. Yet our objectives must remain the same. We still must secure our people, we must secure our devices, and we must secure our data on any device, at any time, using any service.</p>
<p>Secure web gateways were one of the gatekeepers to the old perimeter, fundamentally appliances that existed at the border of a network. Cloud access security brokers (CASB) were fundamentally built to secure the inside of cloud services. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enabled you to securely interconnect offices and remote users onto a single network. Managing these technologies separately became increasingly problematic as the boundaries between networks, the web, and the cloud began to blur. Organizational policies and compliance requirements must be translated to the administrative setup of a specific vendor’s management consoles. At first pass, this results in more errors in the implementation of these policies. Maintenance is difficult as policy changes must be rolled out and implemented within multiple vendor management interfaces. And when you position these traditional technologies against the problem statement of a “perimeterless” world, they fail. The logical answer to these problems is to converge these technologies together and bring them to the cloud.</p>
<h2><strong><u>The Power of Unification</u></strong></h2>
<p>For more than 3 years, McAfee Enterprise has invested deeply into a unified policy framework. We&#8217;ve unified threat engines, data engines. We&#8217;ve built a unified user experience and unified administrative experience to deliver against that promise of cloud native security.</p>
<p>A closely integrated SSE infrastructure can address the management challenges of setting up policies in multiple vendor management interfaces by deeply integrating security controls to reduce overhead, complexity, and cost, while increasing performance. But looking at the competitive landscape, this has proven to be easier said than done. Many fall short with it comes to securing data within the cloud, but McAfee Enterprise’s <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/enterprise/en-hk/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=75143a5d-6b38-499d-af56-2a9d148e7963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry-leading</a> Multi-Vector Data Protection capabilities make it incredibly easy to keep data safe no matter where it resides, with unified data classification, policy enforcement, and incident management.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-130639 " src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2.png" alt="" width="603" height="634" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2.png 880w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-285x300.png 285w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-768x807.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-123x129.png 123w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-24x24.png 24w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: McAfee Enterprise Multi-Vector Data Protection.</em></p>
<p>Other vendors grew up in the cloud but fall short when it comes to connecting to the private resources all large enterprises still use today. Some vendors are attempting to build-out the entire SSE product set from scratch, perhaps as part of a larger SASE offering. Most of the functions present baseline functional capability and the considerable instability of a complex and very new product.</p>
<h2><strong><u>The McAfee Enterprise Security Service Edge Vision</u></strong></h2>
<p>McAfee Enterprise has planned and executed a strategy for several years that takes MVISION Unified Cloud Edge’s complete set of SSE converged security services and then tie them closely to other highly integrated network services such as those offered by SD-WAN vendors to implement SASE. This approach enables most large enterprises the ability to leverage the majority of the technology partners they have to pull a SASE architecture together using much of the technology infrastructure they already have in place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130642" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3.png" alt="" width="979" height="481" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3.png 979w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-300x147.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-768x377.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-205x101.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Enable secure access to web, cloud, and private apps with MVISION Unified Cloud Edge.</em></p>
<p>The increased efficiency of an integrated environment reduces the investment in administration, enhances the precision of policy enforcement, and improves the speed with which security control processes can be applied to data and activity in one single pass, improving security efficiency and efficacy. This earlier <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/remote-browser-isolation-the-next-great-security-technology-is-finally-attainable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published blog</a> demonstrates how our integration of Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) greatly improves security protection in a seamless, cost-effective manner.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-130645" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-1024x389.png" alt="" width="1024" height="389" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-1024x389.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-300x114.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-768x291.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-205x78.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: MVISION Unified Cloud Edge threat protection stack with integrated Remote Browser Isolation.</em></p>
<p>The convergence and integration of cloud security technologies such as SWG, CASB, ZTNA, DLP, RBI and FWaaS substantially enhance operations, reduce cost, minimize errors, and enable more precise enforcement of organizational policy and management. Expenses are lower as experts in the administration and management of separate security controls are no longer required.</p>
<p>In conclusion, McAfee Enterprise has delivered the best and most rapid path to a comprehensive integrated SSE offering available in the market. Our Unified Cloud Edge (UCE) architecture completes that vision of unified and completely integrated policy management today. MVISION UCE is the security fabric that delivers data and threat protection to any location so you can enable fast and secure direct-to-internet access for your distributed workforce. This results in a transformation to a cloud-delivered SSE that converges with connectivity to reduce cost and complexity while increasing the speed and flexibility of your workforce.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">With a Social Security Number (SSN), a thief can unlock everything from credit history and credit line to tax refunds and medical care. In extreme cases, thieves can use it to impersonate others. So, if you suspect your number is lost or stolen, it’s important to report identity theft to Social Security right away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Part of what makes an SSN so powerful in identity theft is that there’s only one like it. Unlike a compromised credit card, you can’t hop on the phone and get a replacement. No question, the theft of your SSN has serious implications. If you suspect it, report it. So, let’s take a look at how it can happen and how you can report identity theft to Social Security if it does.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Can I change my Social Security number?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yes. Sort of. </span><a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220"><span data-contrast="none">The Social Security Administration can assign a new SSN in a limited number of cases</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. However, per the SSA, “When we assign a different Social Security number, we do not destroy the original number. We cross-refer the new number with the original number to make sure the person receives credit for all earnings under both numbers.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In other words, your SSN is effectively forever, which means if it’s stolen, you’re still faced with clearing up any of the malicious activity associated with the theft potentially for quite some time. That’s yet another reason why the protection of your SSN deserves particular attention.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are several ways an SSN can end up with a thief. Some involve physical theft, and others can take the digital route. To what extent are SSNs at risk? </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Notably, there was the Equifax breach of 2017, which exposed some 147 million SSNs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Yet just because an SSN has been potentially exposed does not mean that an identity crime has been committed with it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Report the theft to local and federal authorities. </span></b></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">File a police report and a </span><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Contact the businesses involved.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Get in touch with the fraud department at each of the businesses where you suspect theft has taken place, let them know of your situation, and follow the steps they provide. With your police and FTC reports, you will already have a couple of vital pieces of information that can help you clear your name. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Reach the Social Security Administration and the IRS.</span></b></h4>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Check your Social Security account</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to see if someone has gotten a job and used your SSN for employment purposes.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we’ve talked about in some of my other blog posts, identity theft can be a long-term problem where follow-up instances of theft can crop up over time. However, there are a few steps you can take to minimize the damage and ensure it doesn’t happen again. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/top-signs-of-identity-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">I cover several of those steps in detail in this blog here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, yet let’s take a look at a few of the top items as they relate to SSN theft:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Consider placing a fraud alert.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By placing a fraud alert, you can make it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. Place it with one of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax), and they will notify the other two. During the year-long fraud alert period, it will require businesses to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Look into an all-out credit freeze.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A full credit freeze is in place until you lift it and will prohibit creditors from pulling your credit report altogether. This can help stop thieves dead in their tracks since approving credit requires pulling a report. However, this applies to legitimate inquires, including any that you make, like opening a new loan or signing up for a credit card. If that’s the case, you’ll need to take extra steps as directed by the particular institution or lender. Unlike the fraud alert, you’ll need to notify each of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) when you want the freeze lifted.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Monitor your credit reports.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once every 12 months, </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can access a free credit report from Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. (And as of this writing during the pandemic, this can be done for free on a </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">weekly</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> basis, which is great news.) Doing so will allow you to spot any future discrepancies and offer you options for correcting them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="none">Sign up for an identity protection service. </span></b></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Using a service to help protect your identity can monitor several types of personally identifiable information and alert you of potentially unauthorized use. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Our own Identity Protection Service will do all this and more, like offering guided help to neutralize threats</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and prevent theft from happening again. You can set it up on your computers and smartphone to stay in the know, address issues immediately, and keep your identity secured. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your most unique identifier calls for extra care and protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of all the forms of identity theft, the theft of a Social Security Number is certainly one of the most potentially painful because it can unlock so many vital aspects of your life. It’s uniquely you, even more than your name alone – at least in the eyes of creditors, banks, insurance companies, criminal records, etc. Your SSN calls for extra protection, and if you have any concerns that it may have been lost or stolen, don’t hesitate to spring into action.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/dispatch/origin-of-qr-codes-and-why-theyre-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">QR codes have been around for some time</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Dating back to industrial use in the 1990s, QR codes pack high volumes of visual information in a relatively compact space. In that way, a QR code shares many similarities with a barcode, yet a QR code can hold more than 300 times the data of a barcode. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the rise of the smartphone, QR codes have taken on more consumer applications. Especially in the latter days of the pandemic in the form of contact-free conveniences. Now, by pointing your smartphone’s camera at a QR code, you can order food at a restaurant, pay for parking, download coupons from the shelf at your drugstore or several other convenient things. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet as it is in places where people, devices, and money meet, hackers are there with a scam ready to go. Enter the QR code scam. By pointing your smartphone’s camera at a bogus QR code and giving it a scan, hackers can lead people to malicious websites and commit other attacks on their phones. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The good news is that there are several ways you can spot these scams, along with several other ways you can avoid them altogether, all so you can get the best out of QR code convenience without the hassle.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">QR code scams: a new twist on an old trick</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In several ways, the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">QR code scam works much like any other phishing attack</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Classically, phishing attacks use doctored links that pose as a legitimate website in the hopes you’ll follow them to a hacker’s malicious website. Once there, that site is designed to trick you into providing your personal information, credit card numbers, and so forth, perhaps in the context of a special offer or a phony account alert. Likewise, it could send you to a site that simply infects your device with malware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s much the same with a QR code, yet here’s are a couple of big differences: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scanning a QR code may open a notification on your smartphone screen to follow a link. Like other phishing-type scams, hackers will do their best to make that link look legitimate. They may alter a familiar company name so that it looks like it could have come from that company. Also, they may use link shorteners that take otherwise long web addresses and compress them into a short string of characters—the trick there being that you really have no way of knowing where it will send you simply by looking at it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Luckily some very basic rules about avoiding QR code attacks. The U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) has put together a great list that can help. </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/24636-bbb-scam-alert-watch-out-for-fraudulent-qr-codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Their advice is right on the mark</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which we’ve paraphrased and added to here:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Don’t open links or scan QR codes from strangers.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Unsolicited messages with these links or codes could lead you to a scam site or access the functionality of your smartphone in unwanted ways.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Some scams will appear to come from legitimate sources.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Double-check and see if it indeed is. You can check the official website to confirm, such as by accessing your account or contacting a customer service rep to follow up on the communication sent to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Try alternative payment methods.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> If you receive a bill with a QR code for payment, see if there’s another way to pay it—such as on the company’s website or simply through online bill pay to their known, legitimate address. These are less susceptible to fraud. Likewise, check to see if the requested payment is legitimate in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Think twice about following shortened links.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> As mentioned above, shortened links can be a shortcut to a malicious website.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. If someone you know sends you a QR code, also confirm before scanning it.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Whether you receive a text message from a friend or a message on social media from your workmate, contact that person directly before you scan the QR code to make sure they haven’t been hacked.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Watch out for tampering.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Hackers have been known to stick their own QR codes over legitimate ones. If you see any sign of altering or placement that looks slapdash, don’t give that code a scan.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">7.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee Mobile Research team recently discovered a new piece of malware that specifically steals Google, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram and PUBG game accounts.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The online game market is revitalizing as represented by e-sports. We can play games anywhere in various environments such as mobiles, tablets, and PCs (personal computers). Some users will be looking for cheat tools and hacking techniques to play the game in a slightly advantageous way. Cheat tools are inevitably hosted on suspicious websites by their nature, and users looking for cheat tools must step into the suspicious websites. Attackers are also aware of the desires of such users and use these cheat tools to attack them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></p>

<p>Going by recent headlines you could be forgiven for thinking all ransomware operators are raking in millions of ill-gotten dollars each year from their nefarious activities.</p>
<p>Lurking in the shadows of every large-scale attack by organized gangs of cybercriminals, however, there can be found a multitude of smaller actors who do not have access to the latest ransomware samples, the ability to be affiliates in the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/how-groove-gang-is-shaking-up-the-ransomware-as-a-service-market-to-empower-affiliates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-DarkSide RaaS world</a> or the financial clout to tool up at speed.</p>
<p>So what is a low-paid ransomware operator to do in such circumstances?</p>
<p>By getting creative and looking out for the latest malware and builder leaks they can be just as devastating to their victims and, in this blog, we will track the criminal career of one such actor as they evolve from homemade ransomware to utilizing major ransomware through the use of publicly leaked builders.</p>
<h2>The Rich Get Richer</h2>
<p>For years, the McAfee Enterprise Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team has observed the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/mcafee-enterprise-advanced-threat-research-report-ransomwares-increasing-prevalence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferation of ransomware</a> and the birth and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-the-dark-side-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(apparent) death</a> of large organized gangs of operators. The most notorious of these gangs have extorted huge sums of money from their victims, by charging for decryption of data or by holding the data itself to ransom against the threat of publication on their ‘leak’ websites.</p>
<p>With the income of such tactics sometimes running into the millions of dollars, such as with the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/take-a-netwalk-on-the-wild-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netwalker ransomware</a> that generated 25 million USD between 1 March and 27 July 2020, we speculate that much of those ill-gotten funds are subsequently used to build and maintain arsenals of offensive cyber tools, allowing the most successful cybercriminals to stay one step ahead of the chasing pack</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-130300 aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/0-day.png" alt="" width="523" height="132" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/0-day.png 523w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/0-day-300x76.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/0-day-205x52.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Babuk group looking for a corporate VPN 0-Day</em></p>
<p>As seen in the image above, cybercriminals with access to underground forums and deep pockets have the means to pay top dollar for the tools they need to continually generate more income, with this particular Babuk operator offering up 50,000 USD for a 0-day targeting a corporate virtual private network (VPN) which would allow easy access to a new victim.</p>
<h2>The Lowly-Paid Don’t Necessarily Stay That Way</h2>
<p>For smaller ransomware operators, who do not have affiliation with a large group, the technical skills to create their own devastating malware or the financial muscle to buy what they need, the landscape looks rather different.</p>
<p>Unable to build equally effective attack chains, from initial access through to data exfiltration, their opportunities to make illegal profits are far slimmer in comparison to the behemoths of the ransomware market.</p>
<p>Away from the gaze of researchers who typically focus on the larger ransomware groups, many individuals and smaller groups are toiling in the background, attempting to evolve their own operations any way they can. One such method we have observed is through the use of leaks, such as the recent online posting of Babuk’s builder and source code.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130309" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-builder.png" alt="" width="478" height="594" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-builder.png 478w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-builder-241x300.png 241w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-builder-104x129.png 104w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Babuk builder public leak on Twitter</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130312" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-source-code.png" alt="" width="622" height="188" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-source-code.png 622w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-source-code-300x91.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Babuk-source-code-205x62.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3: Babuk source code leak on underground forum</em></p>
<p>McAfee Enterprise ATR has seen two distinct types of cybercriminal taking advantage of leaks such as this. The first group, which we presume to be less tech-savvy, has merely copied and pasted the builder, substituting the Bitcoin address in the ransom note with their own. The second group has gone further, using the source material to iterate their own versions of Babuk, complete with additional features and new packers.</p>
<p>Thus, even those operators at the bottom of the ransomware food chain have the opportunity to build on others’ work, to stake their claim on a proportion of the money to be made from data exfiltration and extortion.</p>
<h2>ATR’s Theory of Evolution</h2>
<p>A Yara rule dedicated to Babuk ransomware triggered a new sample uploaded on VirusTotal, which brings us to our ‘lowly-paid’ ransomware actor.</p>
<p>From a quick glance at the sample we can deduce that it is a copied and pasted binary output from Babuk’s builder, with an edited ransom note naming the version “Delta Plus”, two recovery email addresses and a new Bitcoin address for payments:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130315" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Delta-Plus.png" alt="" width="622" height="361" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Delta-Plus.png 622w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Delta-Plus-300x174.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Delta-Plus-205x119.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4: Strings content of “Delta Plus” named version of Babuk</em></p>
<p>We’ve seen the two email recovery addresses before – they have been used to deliver random ransomware in the past and, by using them to pivot, we were able to delve into the actor’s resume:</p>
<p>The first email address, retrievedata300@gmail.com, has been used to drop a .NET ransomware mentioning “Delta Plus”:</p>

<p>The ransomware is pretty simple to analyze; all mechanisms are declared, and command lines, registry modification, etc., are hardcoded in the binary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6: .NET analysis with command line details</em></p>
<p>In fact, the actor’s own ransomware is so poorly developed (no packing, no obfuscation, command lines embedded in the binary and the fact that the .NET language is easy to analyze) that it is hardly surprising they started using the Babuk builder instead.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, their new project is well developed, easy to use and efficient, no to mention painful to analyze (as it is written in the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-babuk-moving-to-vm-nix-systems.pdf">Golang language</a>) and provides executables for Windows, Linux and network attached storage (NAS) systems.</p>
<p>The second email address, deltapaymentbitcoin@gmail.com, has been used to drop an earlier version of the .NET ransomware</p>

<h2>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures</h2>
<p>By checking the relationships between “Delta ransomware”, the Babuk iteration and the domains contacted during process execution, we can observe some domains related to our sample:</p>

<p>Thanks to a misconfiguration, files hosted on those two domains are accessible through Open Directory (OpenDir), which is a list of direct links to files stored on a server:</p>

<p>Other domains where files are hosted contain different tools used during attack operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve found two methods employed by the operator, which we assume to be used for initial access: First, a fake Flash Player installer and, secondly, a fake Anydesk remote tool installer used to drop the ransomware. Our theory about Flash Player initial access has been confirmed by checking the IP that hosts most of the domains:</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">(host used for extraction)</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the above, we also found evidence that this actor tried to leverage another ransomware builder leak, Chaos ransomware.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The majority of domains used by this actor are hosted on the same IP: “24.152.38.205” (AS 270564 / MASTER DA WEB DATACENTER LTDA).</p>
<p>But as we saw by “analyzing” the extraction tool used by the actor, another IP is mentioned: “149.56147.236” (AS 16276 / OVH SAS). On this IP, some ports are open, such as FTP (probably used to store exfiltrated data), SSH, etc.</p>
<p>By looking at this IP with Shodan, we can get a dedicated hash for the SSH service, plus fingerprints to use on this IP, and then find other IPs used by the actor during their operations.</p>
<p>By using this hash, we were able to map the infrastructure by looking for other IPs sharing the same SSH key + fingerprintings.</p>
<p>At least 174 IPs are sharing the same SSH pattern (key, fingerprint, etc.); all findings are available in the IOCs section.</p>
<p>Some IPs are hosting different file types, maybe related to previous campaigns:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130357" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/previous-campaigns.png" alt="" width="622" height="248" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/previous-campaigns.png 622w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/previous-campaigns-300x120.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/previous-campaigns-205x82.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 15: Open Directory website probably used by the same actor for previous campaigns</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Interests</h2>
<p>Most of the ransomware samples used by the actor mention different Bitcoin (BTC) addresses which we assume is an effort to obscure their activity.</p>
<p>By looking for transactions between those BTC addresses with CipherTrace, we can observe that all the addresses we extracted (see the circle highlighted with a yellow “1” below) from the samples we’ve found are related and eventually point to a single Bitcoin wallet, probably under control of the same threat actor.</p>
<p>From the three samples we researched, we were able to extract the following BTC addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>3JG36KY6abZTnHBdQCon1hheC3Wa2bdyqs</li>
<li>1Faiem4tYq7JQki1qeL1djjenSx3gCu1vk</li>
<li>bc1q2n23xxx2u8hqsnvezl9rewh2t8myz4rqvmdzh2</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130360" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/follow-the-money.png" alt="" width="661" height="290" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/follow-the-money.png 661w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/follow-the-money-300x132.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/follow-the-money-205x90.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 16: Follow the money with CipherTrace</em></p>
<h2>Ransomware Isn’t Just About Survival of the Fittest</h2>
<p>As we have seen above, our example threat actor has evolved over time, moving from simplistic ransomware and demands in the hundreds of dollars, to toying with at least two builder leaks and ransom amounts in the thousands of dollars range.</p>
<p>While their activity to date suggests a low level of technical skill, the profits of their cybercrime may well prove large enough for them to make another level jump in the future.</p>
<p>Even if they stick with copy-pasting builders and crafting ‘stagers’, they will have the means at their disposal to create an efficient attack chain with which to compromise a company, extort money and improve their income to the point of becoming a bigger fish in a small pond, just like the larger RaaS crews.</p>
<p>In the meantime, such opportunitistic actors will continue to bait their hooks and catch any fish they can as, unlike affiliated ransomware operators, they do not have to follow any rules in return for support (pentest documentation, software, infrastructure, etc.) from the gang’s operators. Thus, they have a free hand to carry out their attacks and, if a victim wants to bite, they don’t care about ethics or who they target.</p>
<p>The good news for everyone else, however, is the fact that global law enforcement isn’t gonna need a bigger boat, as it already casts its nets far and wide.</p>

Making sense of lots of information and noise to access what really matters. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-xdr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDR (Extended Detection &amp; Response)</a> continues to be a technical acronym thrown around in the cybersecurity industry with many notations and promises. Every vendor offering cybersecurity has an XDR song to sing. Interestingly, some either miss a beat or require tuning since it’s still quite an emerging market.  This can be intriguing and nagging for cybersecurity professionals who are heads down defending against the persistent adversaries. The intent of this blog is to clarify XDR and remove the noise and hype into relevant and purposeful cybersecurity conversations with actions. And observe the need for a proactive approach.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with what does XDR refer to and its evolution. As noted earlier, XDR stands for Extended Detection and Response. “extended” is going beyond the endpoint to network and cloud infrastructure. You will find this cross-infrastructure or cross-domain capability is the common denominator for XDR.  XDR is the next evolution of a solid <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</a>. Ironically it was a term introduced by a network security vendor with aspirations to enter the emerging Security Operations market.</p>
<h2>A Look at the Industry Point of Views</h2>
<p>Industry experts have weighed in on this XDR capability for cybersecurity and agree it’s still relatively early to market. Gartner’s definition, XDR is “a SaaS-based, vendor-specific, security threat detection and incident response tool that natively integrates multiple security products into a cohesive security operations system that unifies all licensed components.” Gartner notes three primary requirements of an XDR system are; centralization of normalized data primarily focused on the XDR vendors’ ecosystem, correlation of security data and alerts into incidents and centralized incident response capability that can change the state of individual security products as part of incident response or security policy setting. If you want to hear more from Gartner on this topic, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/innovation-insight-for-extended-detection-and-response.html?eid=5BRXL6DO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the report</a>.</p>
<p>ESG defines XDR as an integrated suite of security products spanning hybrid IT architectures, designed to interoperate and coordinate on threat prevention, detection and response. In other words, XDR unifies control points, security telemetry, analytics, and operations into one enterprise system. The cross-vector analytics must be enhanced to track advanced multi-stage attacks.  In addition, implementation guidance such as reference architecture is needed to assure successful integrated workflows.</p>
<p>Forrester views XDR as the next generation of Endpoint Detection and Response to evolve to by integrating endpoint, network and application telemetry. The integration options are native where the integration is with one vendor’s portfolio or hybrid where the vendor integrates with other security vendors.  The key goals include empowering analysts with incident-driven analytics for root cause analysis, offer prescriptive remediation with the ability to orchestrate it and map uses cases MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques and chain them into complex queries that describe behaviors, instead of individual events.</p>
<h2>XDR Themes</h2>
<p>The common XDR themes from these XDR discussions are multiple security functions integrated and curated data across the control vectors all working together to achieve better security operational efficiencies while responding to a threat. Cross control points make sense since the adversary movement is erratic.  Emphasis is on removing complexity and offering better detection and understanding of the risk in the environment and quickly sorting through a possible response.  The range of detect and response capabilities also suggest that it cannot be done by one exclusive vendor. Many advocates an integrated partnership approach to unify defenses and streamline efforts across domains and vectors. It’s a more realistic approach as well since most organizations do not fulfil their entire security function with one vendor.  While buying an XDR “suite” from one vendor is easier where most of the security tools come from one vendor, some critical security functions from another vendor should be included to drive a more effective detect and response.  This is not a new concept to connect the security disciplines to work together, as matter fact, McAfee Enterprise has been professing and delivering on Together is Power motto for some time.</p>
<p>One more consideration on this unified and integrated security XDR theme, many vendors may proclaim this but look under the hood carefully. They may have a unified view in a single console but has the data from all the separate vectors been automatically assessed, triaged and providing meaningful and actionable next steps?</p>
<p>Another common XDR theme is the promise to accelerate investigation efforts by offering automatic analysis of findings and incidents to get closer to a better assessment. This makes your reactive cycles potentially less frequent.</p>
<p>Integrating security across the enterprise and control points and accelerating investigations are critical functions. Does it address organizational nuances like is this threat a high priority because it is prevalent in my geo and industry and it’s impacting target assets with highly sensitive data.  Prioritization should also be an XDR theme but not necessarily noted in these XDR discussions.  Encourage you to read this blog on <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/security-operations/the-art-of-ruthless-prioritization-and-why-it-matters-for-secops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Art of Ruthless Prioritization and Why It Matters to Sec Ops.</a></p>
<h2>Net Out the Core XDR Functions</h2>
<p>After distilling the many point of views and the themes on XDR, it seems the core functions all focus on improving security operations immensely during an attack.  So, it’s a reactive function</p>

<h2>A More Proactive Approach is Needed</h2>
<p>McAfee Enterprise goes beyond the common XDR capabilities in the recently announced MVISION XDR and offers unmatched proactivity and prioritization producing smarter and better security outcomes. This means your SOC spends less time on error-prone reactive fire drills with weeks of investigation.  SOCs will respond and protect what counts a lot quicker. Imagine getting ahead of the adversary before they attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-130429 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="320" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-205x105.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<h2>Solution or Approach?</h2>
<p>Is XDR a solution or product to be bought or an approach an organization’s must rally their security strategy to take?  Honestly it can be both.  Many vendors are announcing XDR products to buy or XDR capabilities.  An XDR approach will shift processes and likely to merge and encourage tighter coordination between different functions like SOC analysts, hunters, incident responders and IT administrators.</p>
<h2>Is XDR for everyone?</h2>
<p>It depends on the organizations’ current cybersecurity maturity and readiness to embrace the breadth and required processes to obtain the SOC efficiency benefits. With the promise to correlate data across the entire enterprise implies some of the mundane and manual efforts to make sense of data into a better and actionable understanding of a threat are removed.  Now this is good for organizations on both spectrums.  Less mature organizations who do not have resources or expertise and do not consume data intelligence to shift through will appreciate this correlation and investigation step, but can they continue the pursuit of what does this mean to me. Medium to high mature cybersecurity organizations with expertise will not need to do the manual work to make sense of data. The difference with mature organizations comes with the next steps to further investigate and to decide on the remediation steps. Less mature organizations will not have the expertise to accomplish this. So, the real make a difference moment is for the more mature organization who can move more quickly to a response mode on the potential threat or threat in progress.</p>
<h2>Your XDR Journey</h2>
<p>If you are a medium to high mature cybersecurity organization, the question comes how and when. Most organizations using an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution are likely quite ready to embrace the XDR capabilities since their efforts are already investigating and resolving endpoint threats. It’s time to expand this effort gaining better understanding of the adversary’s movement across the entire infrastructure.  If you are using <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-edr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION EDR</a> you are already using a solution with XDR capabilities since it digests SIEM data from McAfee Enterprise ESM or Splunk (which means it goes beyond the endpoint, a key XDR requirement.)  Check out the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/newsroom/press-releases/2021/20210930-01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest award MVISION XDR</a> received amongst the many recognitions.</p>
<p>Hope this blog removed the jargon and fog around XDR and offers actionable considerations for your organization to boost their SOC efforts. Start your XDR journey <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/xdr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>GDPR is a framework which requires businesses to implement processes to enable them to understand where data is held, how it is used, how long it is kept for, how this can be reported to individuals, and how they may request its correction or deletion.</p>
<p>A critical – and often misunderstood – aspect of GDPR is that it doesn’t just apply to EU businesses.  Any company in the world that stores information on EU citizens must adhere to the regulations; serious breaches can result in significant fines.  Even just the top five companies that were penalized since GDPR’s introduction run into the hundreds of millions of US dollars!  These regulations have teeth, so people pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Beyond GDPR’s own impact in protecting the rights of EU residents, perhaps its greatest legacy has been to increase expectations for how organizations handle personal data the world over. GDPR has set a new global standard, and we are seeing it serve as the model for a number of similar laws being mooted or passed by governments all over the world. With that in mind, how many businesses have heard of the PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law)?  In August 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, the top legislative body in the People’s Republic of China, voted for this law to take effect on Nov. 1, 2021.  It has many similarities to GDPR, a key one being that it also applies world-wide with respect to data held on Chinese citizens.  If your company is a multi-national corporation that deals with Chinese individuals then it applies to you, no matter where your business is incorporated or headquartered.</p>
<p>Likely many of the processes you have in place for GDPR can be repurposed for PIPL, however you will be looking for different data.  McAfee’s Data Protection products (<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/unified-cloud-edge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION Unified Cloud Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION Cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/mvision-endpoint-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endpoint DLP</a>, and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/total-protection-for-data-loss-prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network DLP</a>) will help you identify where PIPL-relevant data is held and how it is being used.  Data classifications/data identifiers for the Chinese Resident Identity Card, passport numbers, mobile phones etc can be identified in data stored in the cloud and on premise.  McAfee’s unique multi-vector data exfiltration protection (more on that <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/data-security/how-to-secure-your-data-everywhere-its-easy-with-unified-cloud-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) can also assist in ensuring that sensitive PII data doesn’t end up somewhere it shouldn’t.  Here’s a view of our management console showing how we can identify Chinese PII:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130471" src="https://www.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1.png" alt="" width="904" height="458" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1.png 904w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1-300x152.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1-768x389.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1-205x104.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>No individual product can claim to make a business “PIPL compliant”, but products such as McAfee’s Data Protection suites should be considered a key part of a toolbox to aid in this goal. The fact that we’ve had this capability within our products for an extended time, well before the introduction of PIPL, is yet another datapoint as to why Gartner named MVISION Cloud THE market leader in the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/mcafee-named-a-leader-in-the-2020-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-casb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CASB Magic Quadrant</a> and why Forrester named us a leader in their <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-unstructured-data-security-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forrester Wave <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Unstructured Data Security Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>November is barely a month away and if you’re not already considering how to handle PIPL, you now need to make this a priority.  Consider testing and enabling our Chinese PII classifications.  If you’re running another vendor’s product that doesn’t offer such capability then take a look at how our <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/solution-briefs/restricted/sb-unified-cloud-edge.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MVISION Unified Cloud Edge</a> solution can help solve this along with the digital transformation to cloud first that most companies have already undertaken.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Especially if you work at common spaces like coffee shops, the library, or even your kitchen table, get in the habit of putting your computer to sleep when you step away.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These two devices are grouped because the security features on them are similar. Just like with computers, put your device to sleep every time you walk away from it. It’s much easier and may already be in your routine to hit the sleep button when you put down your cellphone or tablet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your router is the gateway to all the connected devices in your home; thus, it’s key to beef up its security. The best way to do so is to make sure that you customize the router name and password to make it different from the factory settings. Always password-protect your home router! Employing password best practices you use for your online accounts and your devices will prevent strangers from hopping onto your network. Another way to keep your Wi-Fi network out of the hands of strangers is to toggle on the setting to not appear to non-users. While it’s fun seeing the quirky names your neighbors choose for their home networks, it’s best to keep yours completely private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A missing bill or a mysterious charge on your credit card could be the tip of an identity theft iceberg, one that can run deep if left unaddressed. Here, we’ll look at several signs of identity theft that likely need some investigation and the steps you can take to take charge of the situation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How does identity theft happen in the first place?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, it can happen in several ways. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

In other more extreme cases, theft can happen by someone successfully registering a change of address form in your name (although the U.S. Postal Service has security measures in place that make this difficult). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

It could come by way of a data breach, a thief “skimming” credit card information from a point-of-sale terminal, or by a dedicated crook piecing together various bits of personal information that have been gathered from social media, phishing attacks, or malware designed to harvest information. Additionally, thieves may eavesdrop on public Wi-Fi and steal information from people who’re shopping or banking online without </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-a-vpn-and-can-it-hide-my-ip-address" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the security of a VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of how crooks pull it off, identity theft is on the rise. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2020/csn_annual_data_book_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft claims jumped up from roughly 650,000 claims in 2019 to nearly 1.4 million in 2020—practically double</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Of the reported fraud cases where a dollar loss was reported, the FTC calls out the following top three contact methods for identity theft:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Online ads that direct you to a scammer’s site are designed to steal your information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, phone calls, texts, and email remain the most preferred contact methods that fraudsters use, even if they are less successful in creating dollar losses than malicious websites, ads, and social media.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity thieves leave a trail. With your identity in hand, they can charge things to one or more of your existing accounts—and if they have enough information about you, they can even create entirely new accounts in your name. Either way, once an identity thief strikes, you’re probably going to notice that something is wrong. Possible signs include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you can see, the signs of possible identity theft can run anywhere from, “Well, that’s strange …” to “OH NO!” However, the good news is that there are several ways to check if someone is using your identity before it becomes a problem &#8211; or before it becomes a big problem that gets out of hand. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Steps to take if you suspect that you’re the victim of identity theft</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The point is that if you suspect fraud, you need to act right away. With identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, many businesses, banks, and organizations have fraud reporting mechanisms in place that can assist you should you have any concerns. With that in mind, here are some immediate steps you can take:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Notify the companies and institutions involved</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you spot a curious charge on your bank statement or </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"><span data-contrast="none">you discover what looks like a fraudulent account when you get your free credit report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, let the bank or business involved know you suspect fraud. With a visit to their website, you can track down the appropriate number to call and get the investigation process started. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) File a police report</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some businesses will require you to file a local police report to acquire a case number to complete your claim. Even beyond a business making such a request, filing a report is still a good idea. Identity theft is still theft and reporting it provides an official record of the incident. Should your case of identity theft lead to someone impersonating you or committing a crime in your name, filing a police report right away can help clear your name down the road. Be sure to save any evidence you have, like statements or documents that are associated with the theft. They can help clean up your record as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The FTC’s identity theft website is a fantastic resource should you find yourself in need</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Above and beyond simply reporting the theft, the FTC can provide you with a step-by-step recovery plan—and even walk you through the process if you create an account with them. Additionally, reporting theft to the FTC can prove helpful if debtors come knocking to collect on any bogus charges in your name. You can provide them with a copy of your FTC report and ask them to stop.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Place a fraud alert and consider a credit freeze</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can place a free one-year fraud alert with one of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax), and they will notify the other two. A fraud alert will make it tougher for thieves to open accounts in your name, as it requires businesses to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A credit freeze goes a step further. As the name implies, a freeze prohibits creditors from pulling your credit report, which is needed to approve credit. Such a freeze is in place until you lift it, and it will also apply to legitimate queries as well. Thus, if you intend to get a loan or new credit card while a freeze is in place, you’ll likely need to take extra measures to see that through. Contact </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">each </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) to put a freeze in place or lift it when you’re ready.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) Dispute any discrepancies in your credit reports</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This can run the gamut from closing any false accounts that were set up in your name, removing bogus charges, and correcting information in your credit report such as phony addresses or contact information. With your FTC report, you can dispute these discrepancies and have the business correct the record. Be sure to ask for written confirmation and keep a record of all documents and conversations involved. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">6) Contact the IRS, if needed</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you receive a notice from the IRS that someone used your identity to file a tax return in your name, follow the information provided by the IRS in the notice. From there, </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can file an identity theft affidavit with the IRS</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If the notice mentions that you were paid from an employer you don’t know, contact that employer as well and let them know of possible fraud—namely that someone has stolen your identity and that you don’t truly work for them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also, be aware that the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">IRS has specific guidelines as to how and when they will contact you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. As a rule, they will most likely contact you via physical mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. (They won’t call or apply harassing pressure tactics—only scammers do that.) Identity-based tax scams are a topic all of their own, and for more on it, you can check out this article on </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-spot-and-prevent-the-tax-scams-that-target-elders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">tax scams and how to avoid them</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">7) Continue to monitor your credit report, invoices, and statements</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another downside of identity theft is that it can mark the start of a long, drawn-out affair. One instance of theft can possibly lead to another, so even what may appear to be an isolated bad charge on your credit card calls for keeping an eye on your identity. Many of the tools you would use up to this point still apply, such as checking up on your credit reports, maintaining fraud alerts as needed, and reviewing your accounts closely.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Righting the wrongs of identity theft: deep breaths and an even keel</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Realizing that you’ve become a victim of identity theft carries plenty of emotion with it, which is understandable—the thief has stolen a part of </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">you </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">to get at your money, information, and even reputation. Once that initial rush of anger and surprise has passed, it’s time to get clinical and get busy. Think like a detective who’s building &#8211; and closing &#8211; a case. That’s exactly what you’re doing. Follow the steps, document each one, and build up your case file as you need. Staying cool, organized, and ready with an answer for any questions you’ll face in the process of restoring your identity will help you see things through.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once again, this is a good reminder that vigilance is the best defense against identity theft from happening in the first place.

Between group chats, social apps, and keeping up with digital trends, their interests, and attention spans constantly shift, which means online privacy concerns get sidelined. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s why, throughout October—Cybersecurity Awareness Month—we will be doubling up on resources and insights your family needs to be safer and more secure online. Ready to roll? Here are a few ways to move online privacy center stage.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5 ways to focus kids on privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h3>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Safeguard the fun.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Few things will put kids to sleep faster than talking with parents about online stuff like privacy. So, flip the script. Talk about the things they love online—shopping, TikTok, and friend groups. All that fun could come to a screeching halt should a bad actor get a hold of your child’s data. Establishing strong digital habits allows your child to protect what they enjoy including their Venmo account, video games, and midnight chatting. Doing simple things such as maximizing privacy settings on social networks, limiting their social circles to known friends, and refraining from oversharing, can dramatically improve digital privacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Relationship = safety.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We say it often: The best way to keep your kids safe online is a strong relationship. A healthy parent-child connection is at the heart of raising kids that can make good choices online. Connect with your child daily. Talk about what’s important to them. Listen. Ask them to show you their favorite apps. Soon, you’ll discover details about their online life and gain the trust you need to discuss difficult topics down the road.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

<h4><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Deep clean your digital house.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Get in the habit of deep cleaning your technology and bring your kids into the routine. Here’s how: </span></p>

Perhaps it was your middle school email address (“soccerloveR1450@hotmail.com” anyone?) or your very first Tumblr or Myspace account. Whatever it was, it’s likely that you haven’t used these accounts in years — but did you ever actually delete the account? </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over the past decade, you’ve likely collected various </span><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/714981/how-to-delete-your-old-online-accounts-and-why-you-should/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">online accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that you no longer use. But just because you stop using an account doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist — and your data is likely still floating around on the World Wide Web. These old “zombie” accounts haunt your digital graveyard and are easy pickings for cybercriminals.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Haunting of Accounts Past</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Today, most websites and apps either require or strongly encourage their visitors to create user accounts. Almost always, exchanging an email address for an exclusive offer seems a fair tradeoff.  As a result, consumers quickly accumulate accounts, many of which they may not even remember creating. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to </span><a href="https://digitalguardian.com/about/news-events/in-the-news/your-password-isn%E2%80%99t-safe-danger-inactive-%E2%80%98zombie%E2%80%99-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Digital Guardian</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, 70% of consumers have more than 10 password-protected online accounts, and 30% have too many to keep track of. These accounts are comprised of free trials, stores that you no longer purchase from, one-time accounts that you create to buy something, gaming platforms, and apps that you only used a few times. While they may have once served a purpose, you no longer need them.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The problem with zombie accounts is that they contain credentials at risk of exposure. Say that you sign up for a free week trial of a meal kit delivery service. When creating your account, you include information like your email address, password, phone number, delivery address, and credit card information. Once your trial expires, you decide not to sign up for a membership, but your account information remains online. If the meal kit company is involved in a data breach, your personal data could be leaked and exploited by cybercriminals. And if you happen to reuse the same credentials across multiple accounts, a criminal could use credential stuffing techniques (where they use email and password combinations to hack into online profiles) to break into your other accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Gain Control of Your Data </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, how can you keep protect your online data and prevent a zombie account apocalypse? Follow these cybersecurity best practices to help keep your information secure: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Track down and close old accounts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Don’t remember which accounts you made and no longer use? No worries! If you browse with Google Chrome, check under chrome &gt; settings &gt; passwords. This will show all the accounts and passwords you’ve used and saved. Other browsers like Firefox and Safari have similar settings. If you use a password manager, this will also keep a record of your credentials. Once you’ve identified the online accounts you no longer used (or completely forgot you had), close the account for good! This may take some patience, as some websites require multiple steps to close an account. But it will be worth knowing that your information is safer from online exposure. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Make sure all your passwords are strong and unique</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Having a strong, unique </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-does-your-password-say-about-your-preferences/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for each of your online accounts helps protect them from credential stuffing. By using different passwords for your online accounts, you can take comfort in knowing that the majority of your data is secure if one of your accounts is vulnerable.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Update your credentials when necessary</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you realize a company you buy from fell victim to a data breach, start investigating. A tool like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Identity Protection Service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can help you monitor multiple email addresses that allow you to see if you were impacted by a breach. If your credentials were potentially exposed, update them on the company’s website immediately. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use multifactor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Multifactor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is an online safety measure where more than one method of identity verification is needed to access the valuable information that lies within password-protected accounts. This can prevent a criminal from breaking into your online profile by providing an added layer of security. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Invest in protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-ca/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> will help protect your personal information and privacy and provides identity restoration services and invaluable peace of mind. Ninety-two percent of Canadians are concerned about the protection of their privacy and 37% are extremely concerned, reports the </span><a href="https://cyber.gc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/ncta-2020-e-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. All it takes is a few changes to your online habits and arming yourself with the right tools to feel secure about your online presence. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Read the full interview below to see how his heritage impacted his life and career in technology.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you enjoy most about your heritage and what is one of your favorite memories growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>I love the food and music.  To this day I never get tired of eating Arepas, a staple of my Venezuelan heritage.</p>
<h2><strong>Tell us about your journey to a career in technology and how your heritage played a role to where you are today?</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve always liked technology and I took a leap into IT from the Mortgage Industry. I stayed hungry for knowledge and am always eager to learn which transformed my cybersecurity career to where it is today.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you hope to pass on to future generations?</strong></h2>
<p>I want future generations to know that it is never too late to learn something new, and you should strive to learn something new every day.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the three most important things that people should know about your culture?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Family oriented (Family takes care of family)</li>
<li>We are very festive (any chance we get we will throw a party)</li>
<li>A night of having family and friends over will turn out into a cookout and game night of playing dominos</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>What types of foods were cooked for special occasions when you were growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>Arepas, Mandocas, Hayacas, and Paella</p>
<h2><strong>Is there a tradition or celebration that you hope that your descendants maintain?</strong></h2>
<p>I would have to say our Christmas celebrations throughout the month of December.</p>
<h2><strong>As the country continues to grow more diverse, what advice would you give to young Hispanic/LatinX individuals interested in starting a career in cybersecurity?</strong></h2>
<p>Do not let anything hold you back and when it comes to change, have an open and positive view. Learn from those changes to improve, also work on soft skills. From a technology perspective – keep up with the times. Meaning, stay informed on the evolution of technology and threats.</p>
<h2><strong>What are some of your ideas on how to attract more Hispanic/LatinX individuals to cybersecurity?</strong></h2>
<p>Educate and promote early by engaging with local schools. Also, provide internships at the High School/College levels as a summer program.</p>

Take a look at the conversation below with McAfee Enterprise, Joyce Moros-Nahim, LTAM Legal Director</p>
<h2><strong>What do you enjoy most about your heritage and what is one of your favorite memories growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>What I enjoy the most about being Hispanic is that we are very amiable. We are always exited to meet new people and have new experiences. One of my favorite memories growing up is all the time I spent with my family. It was never something my parents had to force my brother and I to do. We were always happy to hang out with our cousins, have lunch with our “abuelitos” (grandparents), and celebrate with our very large family.</p>
<h2><strong>How have Hispanic/LatinX individuals helped contribute to where you are today in life and career?</strong></h2>
<p>I have met and worked closely with many Hispanic and LatinX individuals and their enthusiasm and dedication for their chosen career along with their zest for life has taken them very far in both their home country and around the world. This has inspired me to keep pushing and take on every day with positivity and joy.</p>
<h2><strong>Why were you interested in a career in technology and how has your heritage played a role in where you are today?</strong></h2>
<p>I have always been interested in the technology industry because it changes every day and will be more prevalent as we move into the future. Having been born in a Latin American country (Venezuela), I was always intrigued in seeing how other countries evolved in this industry.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you hope to pass on to future generations?</strong></h2>
<p>I hope that future generations will continue to appreciate and partake in their cultural traditions. No matter which country a Latinx individual is from, they’re typically very family oriented, respectful, hardworking, and loving; which I hope will continue in future generations. <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What family traditions did you have growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>Visiting my grandmothers almost every day and having a Cafecito.  On Sundays, we would also go to church in our Sunday best and have lunch with the whole family. I always enjoyed this time because I would see my whole family and hear about their week. It kept us spiritually and physically united.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the three most important things that people should know about your culture?</strong></h2>
<p>Venezuelans are extremely hospitable, hardworking, and love to befriend people with different nationalities.</p>
<h2><strong>Define and describe the most important (or most celebrated) holiday of your culture.</strong></h2>
<p>The most celebrated holiday in my culture is New Year’s Eve. The families get together and have “hallacas” and pan de jamon, two traditional Venezuelan meals. As it is about to strike 12 AM, we each eat 12 grapes, symbolizing 12 wishes or resolutions we have for the upcoming year. Once it’s 12 AM, we all embrace and celebrate what is to come!</p>
<h2><strong>As the country continues to grow more diverse, what advice would you give to young Hispanic/LatinX individuals interested in starting a career in cybersecurity?</strong></h2>
<p>My advice to a young Hispanic/Latinx individual would be to gain experience in the field and to find a mentor with a similar heritage to guide and inspire you.</p>
<h2><strong>What are some of your ideas on how to attract more Hispanic/LatinX individuals to cybersecurity?</strong></h2>
<p>A great way to attract more Hispanic/LatinX people to cybersecurity is to have programs in Latin American countries that will teach children about technology and how it’s key in our everyday life.</p>

You can do amazing things like stream the latest movies while they’re still in theaters! Or you can enjoy the convenience of online shopping and avoiding the DMV by renewing your driver’s license remotely.  This is possible because we’re able to communicate with these organizations through many different channels and we trust them. Unfortunately, many bad actors have taken advantage of this trust and the ease of communication to up their game when it comes to social engineering. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What is social engineering? One of the more famous examples of social engineering was the Nigerian Prince email scam. In this example, hackers relied on a novel, too-good-to-be-true story of a prince looking to transfer some of his fortune if only he could use your bank account number. The Nigerian Prince is a running joke these days, the internet version of “if you believe that, then I have a bridge to sell you,” but its original success made scammers realize they were onto something big. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Modern social engineering campaigns closely resemble communications from legitimate organizations. They’re carefully designed, may be grammatically correct, and appear in completely plausible scenarios. However, they’re all after the same thing – information to gain access to an organization or individual&#8217;s accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Phishing is common form of social engineering</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses email or websites to convince people to give up their personal information, under the guise of a plausible reason. Instead of a Nigerian prince asking for a bank account number, an email posing as your bank may ask for you to confirm your account information. Often these emails are tied to circumstances that demand your attention and reflect a sense of urgency. Needless to say, many recent phishing scams have played into COVID-19 pandemic fears and economic concerns. Here are a few other scams related to phishing to watch out for:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<ul>
<li>Confirm the source.

<p>I’m incredibly proud to be writing this as the newly appointed CEO of this combined business. Keeping nations and large enterprises safe is – I believe – one of the most important challenges facing the world today. We have already started working together to bring together the best of McAfee Enterprise and FireEye. Together, we see vast opportunities to develop an integrated security platform powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation that will offer an unbeatable security portfolio to protect customers across endpoints, infrastructure, applications, and in the cloud. With our combined energies, we will be able to bring these solutions to market faster, and with greater innovation than before.</p>
<p>And we will do this because of our incredibly talented team. Together, we have 5,000 of the best security professionals who have already been working tirelessly to protect our customers. I am energized about bringing together these two teams to relentlessly protect the world from cyberattacks. Our new company culture will be focused on continuing to deliver on this vision, particularly for our customers.</p>
<p>As a combined business, we have over 40,000 customers, including many of the most well-known businesses in the world. And supporting our customers to be more resilient and stay one step ahead of adversaries has always been a priority – that’s why the majority of our enterprise and government customers have worked with our companies for over 16 years. We are committed to continuing to deliver excellence to our customers through this integration.</p>
<p>Today is a monumental day for everyone in this team. It is also a monumental day for the future of threat detection, protection, and response. Together, we will deliver a new model that creates solutions that work together, in a continuous fashion, to secure our customers across the full attack continuum. We are already seen as market leaders, now our story keeps getting better.</p>

<p>At McAfee Enterprise, we’re celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month by recognizing some of our amazing employees and asking them about their heritage and the impact it had on their career and journey to cybersecurity. Read my conversation with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/zully-gonzalez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuly Gonzalez</a> below on how her family and culture have impacted her career.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you enjoy most about your heritage and what is one of your favorite memories growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>My parents moved to mainland US when I was young. During the summers, we’d go on vacation to Puerto Rico and one of my fondest memories growing up are the plane flights to/from Puerto Rico. This was before 9/11, when flying wasn’t what it is today. My sisters and I would keep ourselves entertained playing games. It was an adventure for us and the highlight was always a warm chicken or pasta meal.</p>
<h2><strong>What family traditions did you have growing up?</strong></h2>
<p>We had two Christmas celebrations, which as a kid, you can’t ask for anything better! We celebrated Christmas on the 25th, which was the big event where we got most of our presents. Then on January 6 we’d celebrate “Día de Reyes” (Three Kings Day) where we would get a few more presents.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the three most important things that people should know about your culture?</strong></h2>
<p>I’d say three things that are central to Puerto Rican culture are: family, God, and passion/hard work. Puerto Ricans believe in traditional family values. Religion plays an important part in our culture. And the Puerto Rican passion is hard to understate. I have to be careful, because a lot of times my passion leads me to speak very loudly, which can sometimes be misinterpreted by non-Hispanics as anger or aggression, when in fact, it’s just excitement. I saw a T-shirt recently that said, “I’m not yelling. I’m Puerto Rican.” This is so true!</p>
<h2><strong>Describe your favorite traditional dish, and how it was prepared. Who usually prepared it for family meals?</strong></h2>
<p>One of my favorite dishes growing up, because we didn’t have it often, was sancocho. It’s a rich, comfort soup made with root vegetables and other starchy vegetables common in Puerto Rico. Ingredients include ñame, yautia, pana, papas, platanos, guineos, maiz, and batatas, among other things. A few of the ingredients are hard to find in the US, and when you do find them, are expensive, so we didn’t have it often growing up. But when my mom did make it, it was always a treat!</p>
<h2><strong>How have Hispanic individuals helped contribute to where you are today in life and career?</strong></h2>
<p>My parents were by far the biggest influence in my life. They taught me that I could be and do anything I wanted in life. They didn’t set limits for what I could achieve and taught me that with hard work anything is possible.</p>
<p>I followed my father’s footsteps by pursuing a career in STEM and attending the same university he attended. In fact, thinking about it now as I answer this question, I think that even more so than my mom, my dad had the biggest influence on who I am today as an individual. He shaped a lot of my personality, my beliefs, and a lot of the decisions I’ve made in my life, both personally and professionally.</p>
<h2><strong>Tell us about your journey to a career in technology and how your heritage played a role to where you are today?</strong></h2>
<p>Family values are very important in Puerto Rican culture. My dad was a math teacher and growing up he was always ready to help me with my homework. During the summer trip to Puerto Rico before I graduated high school, we took a tour of the university my dad went to. I ended up going to that university, which set me on the path to where I am today in my career. I obtained a degree in Computer Engineering and a co-op opportunity (similar to an internship) at NSA. NSA led me to a career in cybersecurity. At NSA I met Beau Adkins, who later turned into my partner in life and in business. Beau and I founded Light Point Security, which ultimately led us to McAfee Enterprise. But it all started with my parents. Without my parents’ motivation, support, and ultimate push to attend the University of Puerto Rico, I wouldn’t be where I am today.</p>
<h2><strong>As the country continues to grow more diverse, what advice would you give to young Hispanic individuals interested in starting a career in cybersecurity?</strong></h2>
<p>Same advice I&#8217;d give any young person interested in any career path. That is &#8211; look for ways to learn outside of a traditional school setting. Getting a hands on experience is so important. First, it shows initiative and passion. Second, to use an analogy: Reading and memorizing a cooking recipe, and even knowing the history behind each ingredient, isn&#8217;t necessarily going to translate into a delicious meal, it takes practice. Practice with the equipment, practice with the ingredients, and sprinkle in your own creativity to make an expert dish. One that people will pay money for!</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And as it is with many such breaches, it took quite some time before the theft of information was discovered.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether or not you have reason to suspect that your information got caught up in this recent large-scale breach, it serves as a good reminder that any time is the right time to check up on your identity.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Quite a bit of identity theft prevention begins with taking stock of the accounts and services you have in your name. This ranges anywhere from bank accounts to public utilities and from credit cards to loans, all of which contain varying degrees of personal information about you. With a sense of where your personal identity is being used, you can better look for instances where it’s being </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">misused</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ways you can spot for possible identity theft include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Track your bills and when they are due.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you stop receiving a bill that normally comes to you, such as a utility bill or for a department store credit card, that could be a sign that a thief has changed the mailing address and has potentially hijacked your identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Check your statements and accounts for irregularities.</span></b></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is rather straightforward, yet it reminds us how important it is to look at our statements closely. Charges that you didn’t ring up or that seem slightly higher than normal are a surefire sign that you should follow up with the bank or company involved and let them know of possible fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Review your credit reports.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">In the U.S., you have annual access to free credit reports from the major credit reporting agencies</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Not only will this give you a sense of your credit score, but it will also show the credit that’s open in your name, along with addresses associated with your identity. Spotting an account that you haven’t signed up for or seeing an address of a residence that you’re not renting are other common signs that your identity may have been compromised.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Sign up for credit monitoring services.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the number of accounts many of us have these days, a credit monitoring service can help you stay on top of what’s happening in your name. Often offered through banks, credit unions, and even insurance providers, credit monitoring can alert you in several instances, including:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, credit monitoring can act as another set of eyes for you and spot potential identity issues.

<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Consider an identity protection service. </span></b></h4>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Five extra steps for preventing identity theft</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Along with keeping an eye on what’s happening with your identity online and elsewhere, there are a few more things you can do to make it tougher for thieves to steal your identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Protect your digital files and devices.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given all the banking and shopping we do on our computers and phones, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">installing and using comprehensive online protection software is a must these days.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> It puts several layers of security in place, such as creating complex passwords automatically, shielding credit card info from prying eyes, and protecting your privacy and data online by </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-a-vpn-and-can-it-hide-my-ip-address" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">connecting with a VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In short, online protection software acts as a solid first line of defense.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Protect your accounts with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned above, comprehensive online protection software often includes a password manager that can generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts and remember them for you. It’s extra protection that makes life a lot easier for you by managing all the accounts you’re juggling. Also, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101"><span data-contrast="none">use MFA (multi-factor authentication) on the accounts that give you the option</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which makes it harder for a thief to crack your accounts with a password alone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Shred sensitive documents when you’re done with them.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sensitive documents come in all forms. Top-of-the-line examples include things like tax returns, bank statements, and financial records. Yet there are also things like your phone and utility bills, statements from your doctor’s office, and offers that come to you via mail. Together, these things can contain personal information such as account numbers, your full Social Security Number, the last four digits of your Social Security Number (which can still be useful to thieves), and other information that may uniquely identify you. You’ll want to dispose of sensitive documents like these so that they can’t be harvested by hackers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For physical documents, consider the low-cost investment of a paper shredder to help ensure they don’t fall into the wrong hands when you are done with them. (And let’s face it, they’re fun to use!) For digital documents, simply deleting a file is not enough &#8211; online protection software is a great resource that often includes a digital document shredder, designed to render the data practically unusable when you’re ready to trash the file.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Keep your Social Security Number to yourself.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your Social Security Number is one of the most prized possessions a thief can run away with because it is so closely associated with you and things like your tax returns, employment, and so on. Keep it stored in a safe location rather than on your person or in your wallet. Likewise, be careful about giving out your SSN. While organizations like the IRS, your bank, and employer require it, there are other organizations who do not—but may ask for it anyway. (Doctor’s offices are a prime example.) If you get such a request, ask them what they intend to use it for and then ask if another form of identification will work instead. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) Keep an eye out for phishing attacks.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing attacks are one of the primary ways identity thieves steal personal information. Whether they come via a direct message, on social media, or through email, text, or phone calls, thieves use them to harvest your personal info by posing as a legitimate organization—</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/70000-phishing-emails-sent-impersonating-the-irs-how-to-stay-protected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">such as in this recent IRS phishing scam</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Phishing is a topic all unto itself, and you can check out this quick read to see how you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/protect-yourself-against-phishing-scams-with-these-security-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">spot phishing scams and protect yourself from them</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">No surprises</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like any criminal, identity thieves do their dirtiest work in the shadows—quietly stealing money under your nose, or worse, as we outlined above. By shining a light on your identity and keeping regular track of what’s happening with it, you can spot unusual activity right away. Even the small stuff is important. A co-worker of mine once saw an incorrect address listed on his credit report. Turned out, that address was used to rack up several large charges at a retailer, which he was able to fix with the aid of the credit reporting agency and the retailer in question. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No doubt about it. Identity theft is indeed on the rise, and your best bet to avoid such a nasty surprise is to keep an eye on your digital identity the same way you keep an eye on your actual wallet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>I’m interested in seeing the continued progress around the unification of threat hunting (EDR, XDR, MDR), as we better understand the power of machine learning, automated detection, and AI as it pertains to quickly identifying malicious code and non-conforming behaviors.

As this technology matures and develops, there is power for good, but it will always need to be balanced in a way that makes sure the uses are ethical and moral. This will be a true new frontier as it unfolds.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that a layered model is necessary to protect valuable data against attacks, but there is fatigue within many IT departments about the number of tools they need and that need to be connected to each other to work properly. Most CIOs and CISOs are looking for platforms that simplify management and streamline threat research to consolidate and reduce complexities.</p>
<p>On the attack front, both the cryptocurrency phenomenon is allowing bad actors to be more aggressive, as they have a way to anonymously launder ransoms, which is why there are so many ransomware attacks happening now. Cryptocurrency needs to be examined from a regulatory standpoint to protect innocent consumers and businesses who are vulnerable to such attacks. Until that time, it falls back to security platforms to assist them.</p>
