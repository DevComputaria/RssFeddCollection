<p>Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend made use of the opportunity to catch up with billionaire Elon Musk on Monday at the 2022 Met Gala.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Keeping Up With Kardashian&#8221; star and the comedian were spotted chatting with the Tesla founder. Along, along with her mother Kris Jenner&#8217;s boyfriend Corey Gamble after making their appearance on the red carpet at the event in Manhattan.</p>
<p>It appeared that they had plenty of things to discuss with Musk. Although, Elon Musk has recently been on news with his recent acquisition of social media platform Twitter. Which he bought for a $44 billion leveraged buyout.</p>
<p>In addition, Kim has a long-standing alliance with Twitter, commanding over 72.2million followers and ranking as the fourth most influential person to use it.</p>
