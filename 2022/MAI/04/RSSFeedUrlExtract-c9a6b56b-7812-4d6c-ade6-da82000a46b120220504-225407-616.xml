<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As editor of her high school newspaper in Batavia, Ill.&mdash;a small town about an hour west of Chicago&mdash;</span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-ent-samira-ahmed-ya-author-ms-marvel-20211004-smc4qd237bfxpjmei2htmb2ciu-story.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samira Ahmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got used to asking tough questions. The paper was where she first thought deeply about flawed notions of objectivity. And it&rsquo;s part of what influenced the dogged nature of the protagonist of her new young-adult novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set to publish on May 10.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follows 17-year-old Indian American Safiya Mirza, a student journalist in Chicago, as she embarks on a mission to find out who killed 14-year-old Jawad Ali, a local boy who went to a public school in the city. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jawad, the son of Iraqi refugees, had a passion for science. Less than three months before his death, he brought a homemade jet pack to class&mdash;only to be reported to the police by a teacher for wearing &ldquo;something like a suicide bomber vest.&rdquo; The arrest was traumatic, and after his death, it stains his legacy, lending him the nickname &ldquo;bomb boy.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ahmed&rsquo;s novel, Jawad remains an active character, a ghost who struggles to communicate with Safiya as she investigates his death. &#8220;All I am is a whisper in the dark to a girl who doesn&rsquo;t want to believe in ghosts,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How do I get Safiya to believe in me?&#8221; All while trying to uncover the truth about what happened to Jawad, Safiya must navigate white supremacy, a nerve-wracking crush, and some cryptic and frightening clues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahmed, 51, is also the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internment</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the <a href="https://ew.com/books/ms-marvel-comic-writer-teases-where-she-wants-to-take-kamala-khan/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=60cb56904c395a00019cc0e8"  target="_blank">first South Asian woman</a> to write the comic book series </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Marvel. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She spoke with TIME about the events that shaped </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how media and police bias impact the response to crimes, and her thoughts on the upcoming Disney+ TV series </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://time.com/5660460/marvel-she-hulk-ms-marvel-moon-knight/" >Ms. Marvel</a>.</span></i></p>

<h3><b>Could you tell me about the process of writing </b><b><i>Hollow Fires</i></b><b>? What was most challenging? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the hardest things was tying all the novel&rsquo;s elements together. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a story about a murder told from the viewpoint of Safiya. But it&rsquo;s also the story of Jawad. And there&rsquo;s a found-document element&mdash;snippets from social media, news reports, and blog posts. I wanted to ask questions about the way media speaks about murder and hate crimes, particularly in relation to race, ethnicity, and religion. Often, the media is unwilling to self-examine.</span></p>
<h3><b>At one point in the novel, Safiya shares how she hated how everyone forgot Jawad&rsquo;s name and instead referred to him generically as an Arab American teen or son of Iraqi refugees. What were you trying to say here about identity?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to examine how race is involved in the way that the press, police, and people on social media treat the victims and perpetrators of crime. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set in Chicago&mdash;a diverse city with huge immigrant populations. If you look at the the clearance rate for police solving murders </span>in the city, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/chicagos-dismal-murder-solve-rate-even-worse-when-victims-are-african-american/100a4f2f-e683-47f2-b3c5-db9e7a07d63e"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WBEZ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that it&rsquo;s much higher if you&rsquo;re white. In 2019, the clearance rate for murders in Chicago if the victim was white was 47%; if the victim was Hispanic it was 33%, and if the victim was Black, it was only about 20%. It made me think about which victims are advocated for, and in my research I found so much erasure of people of color, Black trans women, and Indigenous women in particular. All of that was swirling around in my mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>What real-life news events shaped the narrative? The story of </b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-year-ago-ahmed-mohamed-became-clock-boy-now-he-cant-escape-that-moment/2016/08/02/2b8650be-484b-11e6-bdb9-701687974517_story.html"  target="_blank"><b>14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed</b></a><b> in Texas comes to mind. Police arrested him for possessing a homemade clock that his school said looked suspicious. Was there an intentional link there?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His story is definitely one that stuck with me, although it&rsquo;s not an isolated incident. There are so many stories about the young Black boy or brown girl or Muslim kid being viewed as suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Ahmed, you have this young boy who is bringing in this clock that he&#8217;s disassembled and reassembled in this cool way. He&rsquo;s so excited to have reverse-engineered something and just wants to show his teachers. As a former teacher, I can just imagine this curious, inventive kid coming to school and then having a teacher be immediately suspicious and call the police on him. It was a heart-wrenching incident. </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/glenn-beck-ahmed-mohamed-clock-boy-sues-over-terrorist-muslim-comments-a7334576.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right-wing media jumped in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with conspiracy theories saying he may actually have terrorist links. The family received threats. They </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/ahmed-mohamed-clock-texas-lawsuit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">left the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of my young-adult fiction speaks to issues like this: moments in life, when childhood is shattered. Too often, adults put young people in terrible positions&mdash;choices that adults make impinge on young people&#8217;s lives in ways that they&#8217;re not prepared for and that are so deeply unfair.</span></p>
<h3><b>What personal experiences informed how you told the story?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People think Islamophobia in America began with 9/11. But it actually has much deeper roots. I was 7 or 8 and living in Chicago during the Iran Hostage crisis in 1979. Two white men pointed at me and said, &ldquo;Go home, you</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">goddamn f&mdash;ing Iranian.&rdquo; It was very violent language, especially for adults to use against a child. I was confused for a second, like, What do you mean, go home? Do they know that I don&rsquo;t live in Chicago and that I live in the suburbs? I remember thinking, Why do they think I&rsquo;m Iranian? I look so Indian. Later, I realized: they&rsquo;re racist, and racists are bad at geography. They think we&rsquo;re all from the same place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have had so many other experiences since then. My last name is Ahmed. And in the olden days when we had phone books, whenever there was any kind of incident in which a Muslim was suspected, I would get calls all night long saying, &ldquo;Go home, f&mdash;ing terrorist&rdquo; and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Go back to your own country.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience with Islamophobia and racism has always had this theme of &ldquo;go home.&rdquo; And pieces of that come up in almost all of my novels. Virtually every person who&#8217;s an immigrant or a child of immigrants can understand this experience. And we are seeing it a lot with this </span><a href="https://time.com/5938482/asian-american-attacks/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">rise in anti-Asian hate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the </span><a href="https://time.com/5858649/racism-coronavirus/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I just want to be clear with young people that no one is allowed to tell you to go home when you are home. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did you handle balancing the heavier aspects of the novel&mdash;the murder of a young boy&mdash;with the levity and lightheartedness of teenagers on a mission?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to honor young peoples&rsquo; stories and to write them as they are. That means you can be in the midst of something horrifying and devastating, but you&#8217;re also a teen, and maybe you have a crush on someone, or you&#8217;re dealing with the fact that you really don&#8217;t want to write this paper, or your parents have put this curfew on you. I don&#8217;t think I can write a book that&rsquo;s about deep sorrow and nothing else. I try to put hope on every page, even when it&#8217;s dealing with dark subjects. </span></p>
<h3><b>You&rsquo;ve been involved in writing comics for the </b><b><i>Ms. Marvel </i></b><b>series. Are you also involved in the upcoming TV show?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, the TV show is separate. It&rsquo;s really cute because kids in my neighborhood know that I write </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Marvel</span></i> comics,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they&rsquo;ve been asking me if they can get parts on the show. I tell them I wish I could. One time, a kid came up to me and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Marvel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, right? You better not mess it up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3><b>With great power comes great responsibility, right?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, exactly. I said I&rsquo;ll do my best, but I love their passion for this character. And I love her, so I&rsquo;m going to try and do right by her. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you feel about the upcoming Disney+ series?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m excited about it. Every child should be able to see themselves as a hero on the page and on the screen. And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Marvel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives that opportunity for so many young people to see themselves in a way they&#8217;ve never gotten to before. Especially for young Muslim kids and young brown kids in this country: we&#8217;re so often portrayed as terrorists. When you&rsquo;re always the bad guy, it&rsquo;s very traumatizing for kids. </span></p>
<h3><b>Any other parting thoughts you would like to share?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole time I </span>was<span style="font-weight: 400;"> writing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollow Fires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I felt like the U.S. is at this inflection. We&rsquo;re facing this crisis of philosophy in terms of who we are as a people. One of my novels, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love Hate &amp; Other Filters, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been restricted by Madison County, Mo. schools; the school board vote deciding whether to ban it is on May 9. This entire anti-critical race theory movement is about denying our history and erasing entire identities. It&rsquo;s so important to speak out against this. America likes to bury the truth about itself. Part of what my characters do in these situations is to uncover the truth, even when it&rsquo;s difficult, and face it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity, the nation&rsquo;s largest provider of 401(k) retirement plans, has opened the door for a future of crypto nest eggs: the company announced it would soon </span><a href="https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2022/Fidelity-Investments-Advances-Leading-Position-as-Digital-Assets-Provider-With-Launch-of-Industrys-First-of-Its-Kind-Bitcoin-Offering-for-401k-Core-Investment-Lineup/default.aspx?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioscryptocurrency&amp;stream=business"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a portion of participants&#8217; contributions to be held in Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees who work for one of the 23,000 companies that use Fidelity&rsquo;s 401(k) services will be allowed to allocate up to 20% of their portfolio to the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, the company announced last week. But that&rsquo;s only if their employer lets them. And given widespread pushback against the plan, including from the U.S. Department of Labor, it seems unlikely that many employers will jump at the opportunity for now. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;m hearing, most employers are on a wait-and-see basis,&rdquo; says David John, a senior policy advisor at the AARP Public Policy Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-to-allow-retirement-savers-to-put-bitcoin-in-401-k-accounts-11650945661?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioscryptocurrency&amp;stream=business"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Plan Sponsor Council of America found only 2% of the 63 employers surveyed would consider making cryptocurrency available in their plans. John says that based on his recent conversations and research, the Labor Department&rsquo;s disapproval has had a huge impact in dissuading employers from taking on the risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, employers have a legal fiduciary duty to offer prudent investments to retirees, based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which leads to more cautious decision-making. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen a wide number of lawsuits against employers, charging that their investment mix is wrong, or that the fees are too high,&rdquo; John says. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard employers saying, &lsquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re going to wait and see how this all plays out.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity&rsquo;s announcement came the month after the Labor Department fired a warning shot at retirement plan distributors. In a </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/compliance-assistance-releases/2022-01"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the department&rsquo;s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) argued that cryptocurrencies &ldquo;present significant risks and challenges&rdquo; to future retirees, and that employers that try to offer such plans &#8220;should expect to be questioned.&#8221; Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility compared with traditional markets has been highlighted over the last few months: it&rsquo;s down about 40% from its November high, while the S&amp;P 500 has dropped 10% over the same period.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity, however, argued that it&rsquo;s simply giving investors what they want. A 2021 study by the company found that 30% of U.S. institutional investors polled &ldquo;would prefer to buy an investment product containing digital assets.&rdquo; Dave Gray, Fidelity&rsquo;s head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-to-allow-retirement-savers-to-put-bitcoin-in-401-k-accounts-11650945661"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Wall Street </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Fidelity is seeing &ldquo;growing and organic interest from clients&rdquo; in cryptocurrency, especially those with younger employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision will kick in &ldquo;mid-year,&rdquo; according to Fidelity. Employees will only be able to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolio as opposed to other cryptocurrencies. However, Gray said it was possible that other altcoins would be available in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first employer to jump on the offer was Microstrategy, a data analytics firm led by crypto enthusiast Michael Saylor. (Microstrategy is the </span><a href="https://cryptotreasuries.org/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioscryptocurrency&amp;stream=business"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second-largest holder of Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any publicly traded company.) On Twitter, Saylor </span><a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1520039226305396736"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Bitcoin is a sound alternative investment when &ldquo;equities appear increasingly risky and bonds seem structurally defective.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Labor Department and other experts disagreed. Last week, acting assistant EBSA secretary Ali Khawar doubled down on his department&rsquo;s original stance, telling </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-criticizes-fidelitys-plan-to-put-bitcoin-on-401-k-menu-11651197309?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioscryptocurrency&amp;stream=business"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Wall Street </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal</span></i> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that they have &ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo; about Fidelity&rsquo;s decision. (He did say they would not ban cryptocurrency in retirement accounts, however.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanguard, one of Fidelity&rsquo;s major competitors, </span><a href="https://www.vanguard.com.au/adviser/en/article/markets-economy/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released a statement in November</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arguing that &ldquo;since cryptocurrencies are highly speculative in their current state, Vanguard believes their long-term investment case is weak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a horrible mistake at this point,&rdquo; John says of Fidelity&#8217;s decision. &ldquo;Bitcoin is exciting, interesting and innovative. But for retirement, you need to have a dependable source of savings and income as opposed to what you might &lsquo;play-invest&rsquo; in. We only have a few years of data&mdash;and there is a very strong possibility of a very sudden and precipitous drop at the wrong possible time.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John also pointed out Fidelity&#8217;s decision to allow investors to hold up to 20% of their portfolios in Bitcoin is far higher than the cap for comparably volatile investments. &ldquo;When we look at most of the alt investments, like real estate investment trusts or private equity, the usual proportion for risky investments is along the lines of two to three percentage points,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>

<p>When Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a new lawsuit against the Biden Administration last week challenging the allegedly &#8220;unlawful&#8221; move to grant asylum officers authority to decide some asylum cases, no one was surprised. It&#8217;s the 11th immigration-related lawsuit Paxton has filed against the Administration since President Biden took office.</p>
<p>But the Texas attorney general is hardly alone in his enthusiasm for litigation. Because Congress has failed to act meaningfully since the 1990s to reform the U.S. immigration system, immigration policy has been increasingly shaped by court challenges. In recent years, liberal and conservative attorneys general, nonprofit organizations, and individual plaintiffs have filed an avalanche of immigration-related suits in federal courts, resulting in a profusion of complex and often-contradictory court rulings, experts tell TIME. With Congress on the sidelines, federal judges are now on the frontlines of interpreting and dictating the scope of executive actions, federal guidelines and agency rules&mdash;thereby determining how U.S. immigration policy actually works.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a manifestation of our broken immigration system,&#8221; <a href="https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/stephen-yale-loehr/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stephen Yale-Loehr</a>, professor of immigration law at Cornell University, tells TIME. Congress&#8217;s failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform has resulted in an explosion of agency rules and executive actions&mdash;which, in turn, lead to more legal challenges, he says. &#8220;Today, almost every executive action on immigration is being challenged in the courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This ad-hoc system has resulted, both at the U.S.-Mexico border and within government agencies, in &#8220;peak confusion,&#8221; says <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/theresa-cardinal-brown/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Theresa Cardinal Brown</a>, managing director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), a Washington think tank. New federal rules or guidances are often blocked, terminated, or forcefully reinstated, sometimes with additional restrictions or requirements, just days or weeks after they were announced. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Government officials, immigration lawyers, and lay people are often baffled about the contours of U.S. law, says </span><a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/elora-mukherjee" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elora Mukherjee</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, professor of law at Columbia University and director of the school&#8217;s Immigrants&#8217; Rights Clinic.</span></p>

<p>Giving judges so much power to determine immigration policy also puts the U.S. judicial system in a delicate spot, Yale-Loehr says. Federal judges are often wary of being drawn into issues of national sovereignty or of ruling in a way that impinges on the executive branch&#8217;s authority to conduct foreign policy. But, these days, they often have no choice. &#8220;Courts are loath to weigh in,&#8221; Yale-Loehr says.</p>
<p>Recently, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer questioned the role of his own court in deciding a case about the Trump-era policy, Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which requires the Biden Administration to negotiate with the Mexican government over sending migrants back to Mexico to await asylum hearings. During April 26 oral arguments, Breyer warned his fellow justices to move gingerly. &#8220;Foreign affairs is involved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And, Judges, this is above your pay grade, okay? Stay out of it as much as you can.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
<p>Immigration-related litigation has been around for decades, but many experts point to a moment, in 2016, when the floodgates opened.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2016, the Supreme Court voted 4-4 on a case brought by Texas challenging whether a key Obama Administration executive action known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), could move forward. (Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, had yet to be replaced.) DAPA, <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">an expanded version of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), would have granted some parents of those who arrived unlawfully in the U.S. as children protection from deportation. The tie vote meant the lower court&#8217;s decision blocking DAPA remained in place&mdash;a very high-profile win for Texas. The victory provided a key roadmap for </span>other attorneys general in the years that followed.</p>
<p>When President Donald Trump was inaugurated, it was the liberals&#8217; turn at bat. Within days of Trump taking office, the ACLU brought a suit challenging the new Administration&#8217;s ban on foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from visiting the U.S. Over the course of his tenure, the Trump Administration was sued hundreds of times over immigration policies. Overall, the Trump Administration was sued 110 times by then California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra, a Democrat, according to an analysis by <a href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2021/01/california-cost-trump-lawsuits/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CalMatters</a>, and at least 400 times by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-has-filed-400-legal-actions-against-trump-administration"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ACLU</a> in lawsuits. The lawsuits contested a range of immigration, environmental, and other types of executive policies.</p>
<p>Another reason for the recent explosion of court challenges was the pace at with the Trump Administration moved on immigration issues. Over the course of his presidency, he enacted 472 immigration policy changes according to the Migration Policy Institute, a bipartisan research institution. That &#8220;unprecedented pace&#8221; begot an unprecedented wave of new lawsuits. &#8220;That really accelerated the legal challenges,&#8221; Yale-Loehr says.</p>
<p>After President Biden was inaugurated, conservatives picked up where liberals had left off. &#8220;Conservative states are suing every chance they get to challenge everything that the Biden Administration is doing on immigration,&#8221; Yale-Loehr says.</p>
<h2>An explosion of confusion at U.S. borders</h2>
<p>Texas Attorney General Paxton&#8217;s most recent lawsuit targets the Biden Administration&#8217;s tweak to asylum processing designed to eliminate immigration court backlogs. The idea is that, by allowing asylum officers to decide straightforward asylum cases, rather than always relying on an immigration judge, authorities can drop the wait time for asylum cases from an average few years to a few months. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/03/24/dhs-and-doj-issue-rule-efficiently-and-fairly-process-asylum-claims"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> the shift on March 24, saying it would go into effect on May 31. Texas filed suit on April 28.</p>
<p>The asylum tweak coincides with the Administration&#8217;s attempt to end Title 42, a controversial COVID-19 health measure implemented in March 2020 that the government has used to immediately expel thousands of migrants, including those planning to claim asylum. Title 42 expulsions are slated to end on May 23, and DHS says it expects an uptick in migration flows as a result, including an increase in people seeking asylum. Granting asylum officers the authority to decide some cases, DHS says, will help address growing migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>But at this point, that entire policy&mdash;the Administration&#8217;s move to end Title 42, as well as its move to mitigate the effects of ending Title 42&mdash;are mired in court. On April 4, Louisiana, Missouri, and Arizona sued to block the Administration from<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> ending Title 42 at all. The states&#8217; challenge came on the heels of another lawsuit, brought by the ACLU and other organizations, demanding that the Biden Administration end Title 42 immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">This fog of judicial warfare has resulted in a confusing patchwork of temporary policies. On March 4, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that DHS can expel migrants under Title 42, but could not return families to a country where they faced fear of persecution or torture. That same day, Texas District Court Judge Mark Pittman ruled that the Biden Administration can&#8217;t exempt </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-border-deportation-policy-migrant-children-texas-judge/" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unaccompanied migrant children</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> from Title 42 expulsions.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That kind of back and forth is just terrible for any sort of consistency or continuity in any policy,&#8221; Cardinal Brown says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court will weigh in this summer on whether the Biden Administration can end MPP, also known as &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; policy.</p>

<h2>Congress fails to pass any real immigration reform</h2>
<p>President Joe Biden sent an immigration reform bill to Congress on his first day in office, but it hasn&#8217;t gone anywhere. On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/01/democrats-immigration-reform-infighting-00029087"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Politico</a> that there is &#8220;zero&#8221; chance immigration reform will come this year, even though Democrats hold a slim majority in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>The odds of passing Biden&#8217;s comprehensive immigration reform bill may worsen after the midterms, when Democrats are widely expected to lose seats.</p>
<p>Last week, a bipartisan group of Senators including Dick Durbin, Ill., Alex Padilla, Calif., Thom Tillis, N.C., and John Cornyn, Texas, resumed discussions of passing immigration measures, according to <a href="https://rollcall.com/2022/04/28/senators-relaunch-bipartisan-immigration-discussions/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll Call</a>. Even their efforts are unlikely to go anywhere, many Americans may be happy to see that discussions are taking place. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/17/americans-broadly-support-legal-status-for-immigrants-brought-to-the-u-s-illegally-as-children/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2020 Pew Research Center survey</a>, 75% of Americans say they support Congress creating a legal pathway to citizenship for undocumented people, including 57% of Republicans or those who lean Republican, and 89% of Democrats or those who lean Democratic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American public overwhelmingly supports immigration,&#8221; Mukherjee of Columbia says. &#8220;The challenge is that our Congress is not functional.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When J.D.

The names of allies scrawled in Sharpie reminded the Republican whom he needed to thank for his come-from-behind win. And none was bigger than an all-caps </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TRUMP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the middle of the page.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Now this campaign, I really think, was a referendum on what kind of a Republican Party we want, and what kind of a country we want,&rdquo; Vance said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&rsquo;s right that the results suggest more than a little about the future of the GOP, even if the lessons are about as clear-cut as the top of Vance&rsquo;s jagged cheatsheet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, some context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 15 months, so, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many hours in Washington and in statehouse squares have been spent debating the power that former President Donald Trump retains inside the Republican Party. His </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jan-6-committee-house-hearing-capitol-riot-donald-trump-11627510120"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loyalists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;and his perceived </span><a href="https://time.com/6145764/rnc-censures-liz-cheney-adam-kinzinger-january-6-donald-trump/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">captives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;say he is still the most coveted and powerful endorsement in the game and a danger to those who cross him. His defectors argue that he </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/25/trump-mcconnell-january-6-book/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surrendered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that leadership role last year </span><a href="https://time.com/6137871/january-6-partisan-divide/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Jan. 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that his threats are more bark than bite. </span></p>

The true measure, however, is what Trump can do when it comes time to actually practice democracy in truly competitive environments. Last year offered just one real </span><a href="https://time.com/6113234/glenn-youngkin-virginia-analysis/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia&rsquo;s race for Governor&mdash;and it was an imprecise petri dish for such an </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/16/trump-youngkin-roe/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a New York </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> columnist </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/opinion/trump-youngkin-virginia.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it last year, Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin was able to &ldquo;have your Trump and eat it, too,&rdquo; embracing only some of the Trumpian elements of the party. In turn, Virginia went from </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/virginia-results"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joe Biden by a 10-point margin in 2020 to </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/election-results/2021/virginia/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin by two points a year later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, welcome to 2022, when every corner of this country is going to go on the record with how they see the current GOP and what its future might look like. And those in Washington will have their Excel </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/trump-endorsements-republican-primaries/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spreadsheets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ready to track the Ws and Ls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Tuesday, the March 1 primary in Texas had been the lone experiment, but it is an unfinished one; many of those races will be settled in run-offs on May 24. Trump nevertheless </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/politics/trump-texas-republican-primary-endorsement/index.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he went 33-0 in his picks, ignoring the fact that seven of his picks faced no primary challengers, and another seven ran as incumbents. (As a rule, incumbency is tough to beat; since 1946, 98% of House incumbents who have sought re-nomination have won, </span><a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-2020-incumbents-hardly-ever-lose-primaries/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the University of Virginia Center for Politics.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking more broadly at Texas&rsquo; primaries, researchers at the Brookings Institution </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/03/07/lessons-from-the-texas-primary-and-why-primaries-are-the-most-important-races-in-america/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether the GOP contenders ran as Trump-branded figures or mainstream conservatives, regardless of their endorsement statuses. The data so far suggests candidates who ditched Trump had a higher chance of winning and were more than three times as likely to advance to a runoff than those wearing a MAGA hat. Compelling, and early snapshots from Ohio suggest at least some echoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went 14-for-14 on Tuesday in Ohio. That included his backing of Max Miller, a former Trump </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/republican-max-miller-wins-house-primary-ohio-rcna26428"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is now the party&rsquo;s nominee to replace Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, one of a handful of House Republicans who voted for Trump&rsquo;s second impeachment and then </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/anthony-gonzalez-ohio-trump.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pack it in rather than defend the vote to his party&rsquo;s base. But the U.S. Senate race was the one everyone was watching, as Vance appeared stuck on the ground for months before launching like a </span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2022/senate/oh/ohio_senate_republican_primary-7456.html#polls"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rocket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three weeks ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance&rsquo;s shift in fortunes appeared to offer a clear-cut example of the Trump Effect. He entered the race with deep-pocketed patrons and a national </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2016/08/17/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-donald-trump-usa-today-best-selling-books-book-buzz/88862854/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buoyed by a 2016 memoir that made him the country&rsquo;s go-to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/us/politics/jd-vance-ohio-senate-primary-results.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decoder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the working poor voters who elevated Trump. But in Ohio, which </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/ohio"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/ohio/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump by eight percentage points, many Republicans were initially wary of Vance, who had been a prominent NeverTrumper and had publicly mulled voting for Hillary Clinton. So Vance began singing from the Trump hymn book. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just a flip-flopper, I&rsquo;m a flip-flop-flipper on Trump,&rdquo; he </span><a href="https://time.com/6078483/j-d-vance-interview-trump/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TIME&rsquo;s Molly Ball at a Cincinnati diner last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change of heart for the longest time seemed insufficient. Vance&rsquo;s four main rivals &mdash; three of whom were chasing the MAGA blessing &mdash; hammered Vance for his past comments, like the time he </span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2022/04/possible-trump-endorsement-of-jd-vance-for-senate-brings-pushback-from-ohio-gop-leaders.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump &ldquo;another opioid&rdquo; who stood in to provide &ldquo;easy escape from the pain.&rdquo; Long gone were the country-club Republicans that dominated Ohio&rsquo;s GOP, like Sen. Rob Portman, whose potential successors were locked in a fight over who could be Trumpier than Trump. (So much for the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/politics/ohio-senate-primary-vance-trump.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legacies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of George Voinovich, John Boehner, and John Kasich.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on April 15, Trump </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/15/trump-endorses-vance/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vance, sending what had been a jumbled primary into a status that can only be described as manic. Donald Trump Jr. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/opinion/trump-jd-vance-ohio.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Vance roadshow with pugilistic pluck, trolling anyone standing between Vance and a victory. And the elder Trump flew to Columbus&rsquo; exurban suburbs to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/23/trump-ohio-rally-jd-vance/7429246001/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bolster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vance&rsquo;s campaign in person. Even though almost everyone else in the race still clung to the patina of being a MAGA-head, Trump had anointed his favorite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers show a clear trend: in the span of 19 days, Vance moved from a persistent third place with about 10% support, to winning on Tuesday with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/03/us/elections/results-ohio-us-senate.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the vote. It was an almost 22-point swing in under three weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the other primary fight at the top of the ballot complicates that narrative. Gov. Mike DeWine is about as non-Trumpy as the come, an old-school pol who, with the exception of a two-year break, has been in office or running for it consistently since 1976. In the GOP primary, DeWine&rsquo;s challengers, including former U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, attacked the governor for his handling of </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/ohio-gov-dewine-prevails-in-contentious-gop-primary-nbc-news-projects.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While DeWine broadly won terrific marks for following the science and ignoring the political pressure, some of the party&rsquo;s base viewed his approach as heavy-handed. Trump had </span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2018/04/its_official_president_donald.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Renacci during his failed 2018 Senate bid but stayed out of the primary, even after Renacci </span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brad-parscale-jim-renacci-ohio_n_61661694e4b0f3be08dbf05b"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale as an adviser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, DeWine easily survived, drawing nearly half the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance and DeWine are now set to face off against two mainstream Democrats who handily won their own primaries on Tuesday: Rep. Tim </span><a href="https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2022/05/ryan-vance-win-key-races-for-us-senate/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is looking to move to the Senate, and former Dayton Mayor Nan </span><a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/whaley-dewine-lead-governor-primary-in-early-results/4U73ZDEPHZBK5K6GDK7GVFBLUY/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whaley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who wants to </span><a href="https://ohio.org/things-to-do/destinations/ohio-governors-residence-and-heritage-garden"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upgrade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion in Bexley. Neither can credibly be painted with the same &ldquo;woke&rdquo; brush as the Democratic Party&rsquo;s progressive wing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the two Republican primaries had their own specific dynamics, it does ask what a Trump endorsement in the race for Governor could have done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every race is unique, and it would be a </span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/12/13/is-u.s.-foreign-policy-working-for-ohio-s-middle-class-pub-77947"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mistake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for future candidates to try to replicate Vance elsewhere or to ditch anything looking like Renacci&rsquo;s strategy as obviously doomed. After all, Vance is now a confirmed rising star in the Republican Party, and, at 37, a potential force for decades to come. He </span><a href="https://time.com/6166232/jd-vance-popular-vote/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">figured</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out how to do a Trumpian pirouette and may be part of the MAGA movement&rsquo;s next generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio, however, is worth studying for the power of a Trump action&mdash;and that of his inaction. Vance was Trump&rsquo;s first tangible reroute of a primary while in exile, and it may not be the last time the ex-President&rsquo;s meddling swing results.</span></p>

<p>On May 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve announced a plan to reduce the size of its balance sheet. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220317/"  target="_blank">$9 trillion large</a>, and ten times bigger than it was <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20080911/"  target="_blank">before the 2008 financial crisis</a>, the Fed&rsquo;s accumulation of assets has helped to lower borrowing costs across the economy, lift stock and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/upshot/pandemic-housing-market-wealth.html"  target="_blank">real estate</a> prices to unprecedented heights, and fuel <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3e4bcce-00fa-43fb-a427-625523cdebdb"  target="_blank">record</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banking-industry-annual-profit-hit-record-in-2016-1488295836"  target="_blank">profits</a> for financial conglomerates.</p>
<p>Now the Fed tells us it can reverse course and unwind the emergency measures it first launched back in 2008.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given the underlying structure of our financial system today, the Fed is not likely to get very far. The last time Fed officials attempted &ldquo;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization-discussions-communications-history.htm"  target="_blank">policy normalization</a>&rdquo; was in 2017. Facing considerably more mild macroeconomic conditions, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by a modest twenty percent (to about $3.6 trillion) before <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm"  target="_blank">renewed turmoil on Wall Street</a> led it to resume purchasing financial assets in 2019.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Months later, in March 2020, another 2008-style financial panic broke out. To prevent a new meltdown from causing a second Great Depression, the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3602740"  target="_blank">Fed extended trillions of dollars of loans</a> to financial companies and foreign central banks. It set up scores of ad hoc lending facilities to backstop capital markets and make it easier to trade corporate securities. It did more than it had ever done to keep Wall Street from running aground.</p>
<p>And given all the help the Fed was providing to the financial sector, its leaders expanded further. They set up programs to lend directly to ordinary enterprises. And they invented new facilities to backstop state and local governments. Seeing the Fed&rsquo;s growing footprint, politicians and policy makers are now suggesting that the Fed use its balance sheet to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhockett/2022/01/30/to-reverse-inflation-today-and-prevent-it-tomorrow-the-fed-should-short-sell-commodities-now-as-we-speed-up-production-for-later/?sh=6b644d185e49"  target="_blank">stabilize commodity markets</a>, make transfer payments directly to households, and more. (Naturally, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-her-nomination-to-the-federal-reserve-board"  target="_blank">partisan attention on Fed nominees</a> has also spiked&mdash;with recent <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws-her-nomination-to-the-federal-reserve-board"  target="_blank">confirmation fights</a> focused on whether the central bank should play a greater role in combatting climate change.) Indeed, for over a decade now, the Fed has remained stuck in emergency mode, expanding its programs with each new economic shock.</p>
<p>The root causes of this transformation, however, go much deeper than the Fed itself. The problem is our broken banking system. Since 2008, Congress has failed to address the dramatic expansion of unregulated money creation by &ldquo;shadow banks,&rdquo; firms that operate like banks without complying with bank regulation. Some of the best-known and biggest shadow banks&mdash;like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns&mdash;collapsed or were conglomerated with chartered banks in 2008. Today, some shadow banks operate as standalone hedge funds or broker dealers; others are part of banking conglomerates; yet others operate overseas under the jurisdiction of other governments. But whatever their form and wherever their location, our economy depends on the money instruments they shadow banks issue and these firms depend on, and expect, public backing from the Fed when times get tough.</p>
<p>To understand the role that shadow banks play in our economy today, it is necessary to take a step back and examine the structure of the U.S. monetary framework. Congress designed the Fed to administer a network of government-chartered banks. These banks&mdash;which range in size from local community banks to conglomerates like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo&mdash;are designed to create most of the money in the economy. They money they create is called deposits. Although the Fed issues the cash we carry around in our wallets, bank deposits (not cash) are what employers generally use to pay salaries (e.g., &ldquo;direct deposits&rdquo;) and households use to pay credit card bills. There are <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPSACBW027SBOG"  target="_blank">$18 trillion of deposits</a> circulating today, with only around $1 trillion of cash in use domestically.</p>
<p>The government does not run these banks itself. It outsources that work to private investors and management teams they select. But it subjects banks to rigorous terms and conditions. It bars them from engaging in ordinary commercial businesses and taking excessive financial risks. It also subjects them to intensive supervision by special government officials. And it explicitly backstops banks with deposit insurance and access to cash from the Fed, the central bank. The Fed&rsquo;s job is to ensure that the banking system operates smoothly, creating enough deposits to <a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/the-feds-sole-mandate/"  target="_blank">keep the economy growing at its full potential</a>.</p>
<p>Shadow banks are nonbank firms that figured out how to copy the lucrative part of the banking business&mdash;issuing liabilities that function as a form of money&mdash;without complying with the restrictive rules that prevent banks from collapsing during economic downturns. Shadow banks first emerged decades ago, offering businesses and large investors instruments called repurchase agreements (or repos), eurodollars, financial and asset-backed commercial paper, and money market mutual fund shares, which they began to use instead of bank deposits. By 2007, there was <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo22438821.html"  target="_blank">more of these deposit alternatives</a> in circulation than bank deposits.</p>
<p>The consequences have been major breakdowns such as the <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/slapped-by-the-invisible-hand-9780199734153?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"  target="_blank">massive run</a> on shadow banks in 2007 and 2008. That run took down Lehman Brothers, shrunk the money supply, froze credit channels, and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bernanke_final-draft.pdf"  target="_blank">triggered the worst recession</a> since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Holding together the shadow banking system is why the Fed initially pumped up its balance sheet in 2008. It bailed out Bear Stearns and AIG. It lent hundreds of billions to broker dealers on Wall Street and foreign central banks abroad. By 2008, these institutions were too critical to fail; businesses relied on the money they issued and without a functioning money and credit system, trade and commerce would rapidly contract.</p>
<p>When the Fed&rsquo;s lending was not enough, it started to buy up financial assets to bolster shadow bank balance sheets and heal the damage that the crisis inflicted on ordinary households and businesses by reducing borrowing costs across the economy and limiting defaults. But the economy, still dependent on shadow banks, never returned to its pre-crisis growth path. And with shadow bank money still outside traditional regulatory control, the Fed has been on alert to backstop its issuers.</p>
<p>This arrangement is deeply damaging. The Fed&rsquo;s programs transfer wealth to the financial sector and it&rsquo;s efforts at stabilization inflate asset prices, enriching those who own financial claims and real estate and further marginalizing the majority of Americans who do not.</p>
<p>In order for the Fed to truly and sustainably normalize monetary policy, the government first must repair the U.S. monetary system. Congress must reassert public control over the creation of dollars and dollar substitutes. Shadow banks should either become banks and follow bank regulations or stop operating like banks.</p>
<p>If legislators do not act soon, another 2008-level crisis (or worse) will eventually force their hand. When that happens, the economic, political, and social costs could be catastrophic. Let&rsquo;s make sure it does not come to that.</p>

<p>Victory Day is always a big holiday in Russia: It marks the Soviet Union&#8217;s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, a conflict during which more than 8 million Soviet soldiers died.</p>
<p>But this year, as Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine continues, the day will take on new meaning. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, there&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-victory-day-explainer-intl/index.html"  target="_blank">speculation</a> about whether Victory Day will mark <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/putin-speech-may-9-victory-day-russia/629742/"  target="_blank">a turning point</a> in the war that has already killed thousands and forced millions to flee from their homes.</p>
<p>In March, the <em>Kyiv Independent</em> reported that Russian troops were being told <a href="https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1507095376247074826?s=20&amp;t=g2UK3kTdZE9mYLyY1za1ow"  target="_blank">the war must end by May 9</a>, while more recently, U.S. and western officials have openly wondered if <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"  target="_blank">Russia will officially declare war on May 9</a>, escalating what Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted is merely a &#8220;special military operation.&#8221; But on May 1, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said, &#8220;Our military will not artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day,&#8221; the Moscow <em>Times </em><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/02/russia-not-seeking-to-end-ukraine-war-by-may-9-foreign-minister-a77551"  target="_blank">reported</a>.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8220;We will solemnly celebrate May 9, as we always do,&#8221; Lavrov continued. &#8220;Remember those who fell for the liberation of Russia and other republics of the former U.S.S.R., for the liberation of Europe from the Nazi plague.&#8221;</p>
<p>World War II has shaped Putin&#8217;s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war; In justifying the invasion of Ukraine, he claimed he had set out to &#8220;denazify&#8221; the country&mdash;a phrase that many pundits noted is <a href="https://time.com/6154493/denazification-putin-ukraine-history-context/" >inaccurate</a> in this context given Ukraine has <a href="https://time.com/6154139/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-profile-russia/" >a Jewish President</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" ><em>World War II in Europe Ended 75 Years Ago&mdash;But the World Is Still Fighting Over Who Gets to Say What Happened</em></a></p>
<p>World War II has always been central to the Russian state&#8217;s approach to telling the country&#8217;s history. While the Allies marked May 7 as <a href="https://time.com/3845239/victory-day-may-11/" >&#8220;V-E Day&#8221;</a>&mdash;Victory in Europe Day&mdash;to commemorate the Nazis surrendering in Reims, France, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to wait to celebrate until the Nazis surrendered in Soviet-controlled Berlin the next day. By the time the text was signed late at night, it was already May 9 on Moscow time.</p>
<p>As TIME has previously reported, in the 1960s Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev made May 9 a national holiday, <a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" >complete with military parades</a>. Russia&#8217;s first post-Soviet President Boris Yeltsin turned those into an annual tradition; under Putin, hundreds of thousands of spectators have gathered to watch military personnel march alongside tanks<a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1738768_1585965,00.html" > and missiles</a>. Billboards and buses have featured <a href="https://time.com/3852689/ussr-russia-victory-day-wwii-putin-ukraine/" >posters</a> of Stalin for Victory Day. Tens of millions of Russian citizens have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">marched</a> in Moscow carrying portraits of relatives who died in World War II. Ivan I. Kurilla, a professor at the European University of St. Petersburg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">told</a> the New York <em>Times </em>in 2018 that acknowledgement of family sacrifices during the war &ldquo;is probably the only social glue to form a single society&rdquo; in Russia.</p>
<p>But scholars say that often lost in the Victory Day celebrations are hard truths about what Russia&#8217;s victory in the war really meant. &#8220;The Stalin regime was almost as criminal as the Hitler regime,&#8221; scholar Nikolay Koposov <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/webcast-victory-day-and-russias-politics-history"  target="_blank">stated</a> in a Wilson Center webcast in 2020, &#8220;and most Russians do not realize that the war was not for their freedoms but was largely a battle between the two dictators.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><a href="https://time.com/6170974/olaf-scholz-germany-interview/" ><em>Chancellor Olaf Scholz Wants to Transform Germany&#8217;s Place in the World. He&#8217;d Just Rather Not Talk About It</em></a></p>
<p>Pundits in Russia have pointed out that Victory Day has also become about more than just celebrating Russia&#8217;s military achievements in the past; it&#8217;s very much about galvanizing support for Russia in the present and showing off the strength of Russia&#8217;s military forces.</p>
<p>Journalist Andrei Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a> in a 2017 article about the modern-day significance of Victory Day that it&#8217;s &#8220;central&#8221; to Putin&#8217;s view of Russian history, and &#8220;the Great Patriotic War&#8221; has become his nickname for World War II. &#8220;The current regime, which calls itself the sole heir of this victory, uses this achievement to make itself immune to criticism on other issues while justifying its current militarization efforts and excessive state interference in all aspects of life,&#8221; Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;In its official conception, Russia&rsquo;s commemoration of Victory Day in 1945 is only formally an occasion for collectively mourning for Russia&rsquo;s war dead. It has turned instead into an instrument for providing support to the most militarized, bellicose kind of Russian leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the walk-up to Victory Day this year, the United Nations <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/26/1094796253/ukraine-russia-refugees"  target="_blank">says</a> that the Russia-Ukraine war has displaced more than 5 million Ukrainians so far&mdash;and projects it will displace more than 8 million before it&#8217;s done.</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173205/elon-musk-twitter-female-sports-reporters/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s $44 billion takeover of <a href="https://time.com/6170647/elon-musk-twitter-harassment-employees/" >Twitter</a>, announced last week, has raised alarms for many <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8799543/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-online-harassment-concerns/"  target="_blank">marginalized groups</a> often subject to online harassment. Musk has called himself a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499976967105433600"  target="_blank">free speech absolutionist&#8221;</a> who wants people on Twitter to &#8220;have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.&#8221; Female journalists who cover sports for a living are often subject to a particularly cruel brand of online abuse. Across sports media, these women are worried. &#8220;Can&#8217;t imagine how female journos can stay on Twitter with Musk in charge,&#8221; Julie DiCaro, a senior writer and editor at Deadspin, <a href="https://twitter.com/JulieDiCaro/status/1518595822618873856"  target="_blank">wrote</a> on Twitter on April 25, referencing Musk&#8217;s own toxic Twitter behavior: in 2018 Musk, during an online spat, called a man recruiting divers to rescue a dozen children trapped in a Thai cave a &#8220;pedo guy.&#8221; Musk deleted the tweet and survived a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695593"  target="_blank">defamation suit</a> against him. Musk, DiCaro wrote, &#8220;is about to unleash all the beasts again.&#8221;<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>DiCaro knows these online tormentors all too well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tU-D-m2JY8"  target="_blank">In a searing 2016 clip</a> that&#8217;s been viewed nearly 5 million times on YouTube, DiCaro&mdash;then a writer for The Cauldron and anchor at 670 The Score, a Chicago sports radio station&mdash;and ESPN reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahSpain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"  target="_blank">Sarah Spain</a> participated in an anti-bullying PSA: men sat across from DiCaro and Spain on camera, and read &#8220;mean tweets&#8221; about them back to the two journalists. Some missives are so misogynistic and violent, the men can barely read the words on their screens.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are guys who basically, I&#8217;m their hobby,&#8221; DiCaro tells TIME. &#8220;They spend their entire day talking about me, trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on in my life. Hitting me wherever they can, making fun of me, sharing it with everyone so they can all laugh about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>USA Today columnist <a href="https://twitter.com/nrarmour"  target="_blank">Nancy Armour</a> says that whenever she writes about Tom Brady, Colin Kaepernick, or Kobe Bryant, her Twitter mentions turn into a &#8220;dumpster fire.&#8221; Reactions range from those wishing Armour loses her job, to those saying they hope she catches a horrible disease. After she criticized former NASCAR driver Tony Stewart in an article, Armour says that someone &#8220;told me that she wanted to find me and bash my head into a concrete curb until I died.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since female journalists started to report in men&#8217;s locker rooms in the 1970s&mdash;following a successful lawsuit filed by former <em>Sports Illustrated</em> reporter <a href="https://time.com/4061122/ludtke-kuhn-jaguars-colts/" >Melissa Ludtke</a>&mdash; the presence of women in sports media has always sparked uniquely wicked forms of resentment. In 1986, for example, Oakland A&#8217;s slugger Dave Kingman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/sports/kingman-fined-3500.html"  target="_blank">sent a live rat</a> to reporter Susan Fornoff, who said Kingman told her he believed women didn&#8217;t belong in the clubhouse. In 1990, Lisa Olson of the Boston <em>Herald</em> revealed that several New England Patriots players exposed themselves to her and sexually harassed her; she said she received death threats after making the allegations, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/12/02/travesty-in-the-locker-room/6800d9cf-9adb-4704-af00-ec3eb9263b78/"  target="_blank">an NFL investigation</a> found to be true. These days, sports fans spew venom toward women journalists via anonymous Twitter handles.</p>
<p>Female sports journalists, says Armour, are &#8220;a threat to the quote-unquote, natural order, or the way things have always been. For generations, sports was a male domain. Sports were played by men, and written about and consumed by men. It was a boys&#8217; game. That&#8217;s no longer the case. And there are some people who don&#8217;t deal real well with that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Accountability needed</h2>
<p>Armour gives Twitter credit for responding to reports of abuse. &#8220;If you say something that is that is physical, if you are making a physical threat to me or somebody else, then I report it to Twitter,&#8221; says Armour. &#8220;And I feel like those responses have gotten quicker. It used to be that I&#8217;d get a message like three weeks later. I wouldn&#8217;t even remember what the heck it was. Now, it seems like it gets turned around in a day or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiCaro, who says that online abuse drove her back into therapy last year, hasn&#8217;t seen the same volume of vile messages as she did a few years ago. She chalks up this improvement, however, to female sports journalists such as herself ignoring their detractors, and using Twitter&#8217;s blocking and muting mechanisms to their advantage. &#8220;We have seen sort of a downtick in it, but it&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve made the choice to use these things Twitter&#8217;s made available,&#8221; says DiCaro. &#8220;Not because Twitter&#8217;s done a great job of moderating this or because they&#8217;ve had some kind of come to Jesus moment and have decided they&#8217;re gonna treat people better. I think it&#8217;s mostly women making a decision to prioritize their mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some sports journalists worry that Musk is conflating free speech guaranteed by governments with sensible rules created by private organizations. While it&#8217;s legal, for example, to walk into a store and hurl insults at fellow customers, the manager has every right to kick you out. &#8220;We need to have some civic education about what freedom of speech actually means,&#8221; says Armour. &#8220;I hope that if the deal does go through, Musk talks to the people at Twitter, and finds out their reasonings for why they have put the safeguards in place, and get a sense of what is at stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Elon Musk saying he wants to encourage more free speech, my viewpoint is, is this free speech going to come with accountability still intact?&#8221; says <a href="https://twitter.com/iamvalenciaking"  target="_blank">Valencia King</a>, a sports journalist based in Dallas.</p>
<p>Some journalists are skeptical, given Musk&#8217;s past history. A 2018 <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-its-like-when-elon-musks-twitter-mob-comes-after-you"  target="_blank">Daily Beast story</a>, for example, detailed examples of the harsh treatment female reporters receive from male Musk supporters when they criticize him online; in response, Musk <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/45319-elon-musk-erin-biba-daily-beast-twitter"  target="_blank">criticized</a> the article&#8217;s writer, a woman, on Twitter. He&#8217;s tweeted out <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1453954994546229253"  target="_blank">infantile, sexist jokes</a>. Female workers at Tesla, Musk&#8217;s $54 billion automotive and clean energy company, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/"  target="_blank">sued</a> the company for sexual harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t imagine how things are gonna get better,&#8221; says DiCaro. &#8220;It just feels like things are gonna get a lot worse.&#8221;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173543/world-press-freedom-index-2022/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalism is coming under increasingly intense pressure in Ukraine, exacerbated by the war, as press freedom remains restricted in well over two thirds of the world, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSF&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://rsf.org/en/index"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 World Press Freedom Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released on May 3, which measures access to information and curbs on journalistic freedoms, found that the situation for the press is &ldquo;very bad&rdquo; in 28 countries, &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; in 42 and &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; in 62. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those 132 countries represent just over 73% of the 180 nations surveyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia&rsquo;s February invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war is a threat to the future of Ukrainian media, which were already fairly restricted before the invasion due to an oligarch monopoly, according to RSF. Ukraine ranks 106 on the index of 180 countries, while Russia ranks 155. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In this &#8216;information war&#8217;, Ukraine stands at the front line of resistance against the expansion of the Kremlin&rsquo;s propaganda system,&rdquo; RSF said in its report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since February, journalists in Ukraine have been deliberately targeted by military fire, and the number of reporters killed has risen to at least 20, according to the </span><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/04/13/20-journalists-killed-in-ukraine-war-union-a77336"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s government has blocked media carrying Kremlin-backed propaganda, while the Russian army has deliberately targeted journalists, media and infrastructure to prevent the Ukrainian population from having access to independent news and information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://time.com/6151572/russian-media-ukraine-coverage/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, journalism was already tightly controlled by the Kremlin before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, but some independent media outlets fought to challenge the state narrative. That changed on March 4, when President Vladimir Putin </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/russia-censorship-media-crackdown.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted a law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making sharing &ldquo;false information&rdquo; about the war punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Kremlin also blocked access to Facebook and foreign news outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clampdown forced independent media outlets&mdash;including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novaya Gazeta,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is led by </span><a href="https://time.com/6126259/nobel-peace-prize-dmitry-muratov/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;to cease publication. The Russian version of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euronews </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was suspended by the country&rsquo;s media regulator on March 22, and all privately-owned independent TV channels, except for cable entertainment channels, are banned from broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, Crimea and Donbass, the media are silenced and often replaced by Kremlin propaganda, according to RSF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, footage circulated on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1514339222118883334?s=20&amp;t=jOLWfK2xHUOYDvuT1m1_9A"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Margarita Simonyan, the Editor in Chief of Russian state broadcaster RT advocating for government censorship of the media. &ldquo;No great nation can exist without control over information,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global media polarization has increased two-fold over the past year, RSF found. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disparity between open societies and authoritarian regimes that censor negative media coverage and spread propaganda is fuelling geopolitical tensions. Leading up to and following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia </span><a href="https://time.com/6151578/russia-disinformation-ukraine-social-media/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">disseminated false information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to dupe Ukrainian forces, denounced foreign reports of war crimes as </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-denies-killing-civilians-ukraines-bucha-2022-04-03/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;fakes&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/15/1086705796/russian-propaganda-war-in-ukraine"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anti-war reporting back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The creation of media weaponry in authoritarian countries eliminates their citizens&rsquo; right to information but is also linked to the rise in international tension, which can lead to the worst kind of wars,&rdquo; RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.</span></p>
<h2>Women journalists under most threat in Afghanistan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The press freedom index highlighted that journalists in Afghanistan and Hong Kong have also come under increased constraints. The fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August last year radically altered Afghanistan&rsquo;s media landscape&mdash;within the space of three months, almost half of media outlets disappeared. At the end of last year, only four out of 10 journalists were still in their jobs, according to RSF. The country plunged to 156 on the index, in the worst category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Journalists and independent media all over the world are at risk right now,&rdquo; says </span><a href="https://time.com/collection/women-of-the-year/6150546/zahra-joya/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zahra Joya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Afghan journalist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who leads an independent platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to spotlight women&rsquo;s stories in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joya, who founded </span><a href="https://rukhshana.com/en/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rukhshana Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 and works with women journalists on the ground in the country, says many fear for their safety. &ldquo;They are working in extremely difficult situations because they are in hiding,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They are in serious danger, they could be tortured.&rdquo; The few that can work are forced by the Taliban to cover up and are completely separated from their male colleagues. In southern regions like Kandahar, Joya says there isn&rsquo;t a single woman journalist left working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSF found only 410 women journalists were still working in the country in December. The shift reflects a trend across the country as a whole, where four out of 5 women have lost their jobs compared to around half of men. J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oya, was forced to flee the country when she realized the danger posed to women journalists under Taliban rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If women are not represented in newsrooms, the Afghan media will fail half the country&rsquo;s population, Joya says. &ldquo;If women can&#8217;t be educated, and they can&rsquo;t have contact with the male journalists, they can&rsquo;t share their stories and experiences,&rdquo; Joya says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban, who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were last in power from 1996 to 2001, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also control and review all media reports before they are released, to remove negative coverage. &ldquo;They haven&#8217;t changed. They are still the Taliban who they were in 1996,&rdquo; Joya says.</span></p>
<h2><b>National Security Law crackdown on Hong Kong journalists</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hong Kong, where independent journalism previously thrived, the local press has been restricted since the introduction of the </span><a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Security Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June 2020, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibits acts deemed to be treason, secession, sedition, and subversion against the Chinese government. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the silencing of prominent journalists and media outlets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong has fallen over a third of the way down RSF&rsquo;s index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, two major independent news outlets, </span><a href="https://time.com/6074478/apple-daily-close-hong-kong/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Daily</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were forced to shut down after the government froze their assets, while numerous smaller-scale media outlets ceased operations due to the legal risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public broadcaster </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio Television Hong Kong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;once </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-57253030"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Hong Kong&rsquo;s version of the BBC&mdash;has been placed under a pro-government management, which has prevented programs featuring pro-democracy advocates from airing. Beijing-backed Hong Kong lawmakers have claimed the broadcaster is biased, and welcomed the sacking of editorial staff who criticized the regime. The platform has also been used to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promote </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-57253030"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing-led changes to electoral laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to RSF, journalists are a prime target of the National Security Law. Following on from the arrest of hundreds of journalists during the pro-democracy protests in 2019, a dozen more were detained last year. Earlier this month, a prominent journalist and former columnist of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allan Au was</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/prominent-hong-kong-journalist-allan-au-reportedly-held-on-sedition-charge"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for allegedly conspiring to publish &ldquo;seditious materials&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amber Heard took the stand today and tearfully described alleged abuse by her ex-husband Johnny Depp, who is <a href="https://time.com/6171006/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial/" >suing her for defamation</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-profile trial, which is being held in Fairfax County, Virginia, is in its fourth week. This is the second lawsuit stemming from the former relationship between Depp and Heard, following a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/johnny-depp-libel-case.html?referringSource=articleShare"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial in the U.K.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, Depp&rsquo;s legal team rested its case, claiming that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pirates of the Caribbean </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actor was defamed by an op-ed Heard published in the Washington </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. In the op-ed, Heard referred to herself as a &ldquo;public figure representing domestic abuse.&rdquo; While Heard did not mention Depp by name in the op-ed, over nearly two weeks of testimony and two dozen witnesses, Depp and his legal team made the case that the op-ed not only defamed him, but <a href="https://time.com/6173134/johnny-depp-accountant-lost-money-trial/" >was &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; for his career</a>. Heard is expected to argue that Depp&rsquo;s career was already on the rocks.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After <a href="https://time.com/6172789/johnny-depp-agent-testimony-trial/" >Depp&rsquo;s attorneys rested their case</a>, Heard&rsquo;s legal team asked the judge to dismiss the case on the grounds that Depp had not proven his case. The judge, Penny Azcarate, partially denied the motion, saying that Depp&rsquo;s team had shown sufficient evidence of defamation to allow the case to continue.</span></p>

<h2><b>Psychologist Dawn Hughes&rsquo; testimony</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Heard called her first witness, Dawn Hughes, a clinical and forensic psychologist who specializes in abusive relationships. Hughes testified that after interviewing Heard, analyzing her case files, and interviewing some of Heard&rsquo;s physicians, as well as her mother, she believes that Heard suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from her relationship with Depp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the stand, Hughes described several alleged </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual assaults by Depp, including a &ldquo;cavity search&rdquo; he conducted on Heard while they were married, </span><a href="https://people.com/movies/johnny-depp-once-did-cavity-search-on-amber-heard-psychologist-testifies/"  target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One incident described by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the psychologist involved Depp allegedly yelling &ldquo;I will kill you&rdquo; while putting a liquor bottle inside Heard&rsquo;s body. Hughes testified that Heard was repeatedly &ldquo;subjected to sexual violence&rdquo; from Depp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depp and his lawyers have denied any sexual violence by him in the couple&rsquo;s relationship.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Hughes&rsquo; cross examination</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hughes, the forensic psychologist, testified that she determined Heard suffered from PTSD, Depp&rsquo;s attorney cross examined her. He replayed audio heard earlier in the trial, in which Heard confessed to hitting Depp. Hughes testified that Heard admitted to hitting Depp &ldquo;a number of times, in a number of instances,&rdquo; </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/05/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-domestic-abuse-1235016120/"  target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadline</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depp&rsquo;s attorney pointed out that while Hughes interviewed Heard a number of times, she never spoke to Depp. Hughes argued that her analysis was determined by talking with Heard as well as reading </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deposition testimony, poring over transcripts, and reviewing text messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hughes&rsquo; testimony directly contradicts the findings of Dr. Shannon Curry, the forensic psychologist hired by Depp&rsquo;s team, who</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">testified that Heard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed no signs of PTSD.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Amber Heard&rsquo;s testimony</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heard took the stand today to defend herself in the $50 million defamation suit brought against her by her ex-husband. Under oath, the actress recounted the early days of her relationship with Depp and recalled falling &#8220;head over heels in love&#8221; with the actor. She recalled the first time Depp allegedly hit her, in winter 2011. &#8220;I will never forget it. It changed my life,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p>Heard often grew tearful while describing the incident. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all of a sudden realizing that the worst thing that could happen to me happened,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The darker days of the couple&rsquo;s relationship have been on full display during the trial. &ldquo;I struggle to find the words to describe how painful this is,&rdquo; Heard testified, </span><a href="https://people.com/movies/amber-heard-takes-stand-in-johnny-depp-defamation-case/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;This is horrible for me to sit here for weeks and relive everything. This is the most painful and difficult thing I&rsquo;ve ever gone through, for sure.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><b>What happens next</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heard is expected to continue testifying&mdash;and face cross-examination&mdash;on Thursday.</span></p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173536/economic-risk-climate-geography/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that global climate change <a href="https://time.com/6093845/how-heat-hurts-the-economy/" >hurts the economy</a>. With more frequent and more severe storms, flooding, drought, and fires, countries around the world are already taking economic hits. And as long-term events like rising sea levels and temperature patterns continue to affect agriculture and human health, the economic damage will only grow.</p>
<p>The impact, however, will be <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/ratings/research/101529900.pdf"  target="_blank">unequally distributed</a>. A recent report from <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/01/dominica-lost-almost-all-gdp-climate-change"  target="_blank">S&amp;P Global</a> assessed how 135 countries might be affected by climate-related events in 2050. The economic risk levels ranged from 0% of GDP (indicating that the economy will likely not be exposed to climate hazards) to 100% of GDP (the entire economy could be exposed to climate hazards). The measurement predicts only economic vulnerability&mdash;not economic loss. For example, a country with 80% GDP exposure doesn&rsquo;t mean that 80% of the economy will be wiped out in 30 years, but rather that 80% of the economy is <em>at risk</em> of experiencing a loss.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Using these percentages, TIME &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; countries on a blue-to-red scale to see which economies are in least and most danger. But instead of a standard map&mdash;one with, say, borders and oceans&mdash;we looked at each country as a latitudinal point. The result was a chart that looks a bit like a volcano turned sideways.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Share of country GDP exposed to climate impacts, by latitude" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4W5jT/5/#?secret=zhEmMHBlIn" data-secret="zhEmMHBlIn" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="540"></iframe></p>
<p>What this shows is that economies that have huge physical climate risk&mdash;in some cases 100% exposed&mdash;are generally within 20 degrees of the equator. And none are in the far northern or southern parts of the globe. On the other hand, countries that have minimal risk are from a wide range of latitudes, but skew more to the poles.</p>
<p>To arrive at these numbers, S&amp;P Global researchers considered how much of each country&rsquo;s area is prone to experience wildfires, storms, floods, and rising sea levels, as well as how much of agricultural land is at risk of water stress, and workforce population impacted by extreme heat.</p>
<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6171610/palau-marine-protected-area-climate-justice/" ><em>One Island Nation&#8217;s Controversial Plan to Take Climate Justice Into Its Own Hands</em></a></p>
<p>There are a few reasons why this geographic pattern exists. For one, a number of nations at or near Earth&rsquo;s waistline are small island states that are highly vulnerable to massive storms that can devastate infrastructure and crimp their most dependent industries, such as tourism. Additionally, a large share of countries located around the equator have less diversified economies that rely on physical labor to produce goods. Extreme heat can have devastating effects on labor productivity in these nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, higher-income and service-driven countries like Botswana and South Africa, which are at the tip of the continent, have 19% and 0% GDP exposure; low-income countries like Ethiopia and Burkina Faso that rely more on agriculture and industry and sit just above the equator, have 93% and 99% GDP exposure, respectively.</p>
<p>A separate element of the study looked at how prepared each country might be to adapt to climate impacts on a scale from 1 (most ready) to 6 (least ready). This score is not a factor in the GDP risk assessment, but it does serve to show how prepared each country might be to address those risks.</p>
<p>When TIME plotted this readiness assessment based on country latitude, the trends&mdash;particularly at the extreme ends of the readiness scale&mdash;were even more stark than GDP exposure. Among countries with the best readiness score, only the highly developed city-state of Singapore lies on the equator. And conversely, nearly all the countries with the worst readiness score are within 20 degrees of the equator.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Readiness to adapt to climate risks, by latitude" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/haM2n/4/#?secret=MBFr5XzCHw" data-secret="MBFr5XzCHw" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="546"></iframe></p>
<p>Taken together, the charts indicate that countries in northern and southern latitudes are more likely to have resources to prepare the best for climate effects&mdash;even though their economies are the least at risk. This is because these nations, particularly those on the European continent&mdash;have diversified and service-based economies that can take Mother Nature&rsquo;s punches. They are also wealthier and more technologically advanced, which allows them to funnel resources into climate adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>While S&amp;P Global didn&rsquo;t quantify GDP losses on a country level due to uncertainty surrounding the reliability of data at that level, it did calculate an estimate for global regions and the world. It found that 4% of the global economy could be lost to climate change impacts by 2050, assuming that countries stick to their current pledges to address climate change. As Marion Amiot, one of authors of the study, points out, a loss that small may not seem like a big deal, but it would be even worse than the 3.4% global GDP decline in 2020 due to COVID-19.</p>
