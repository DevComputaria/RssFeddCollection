      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the web services interface for remote access VPN features of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, but unprivileged, remote attacker to elevate privileges to level 15.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication and authorization scopes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS messages to the web services interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privilege level 15 access to the web management interface of the device. This includes privilege level 15 access to the device using management tools like the Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or the Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Security Manager (CSM).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; With Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;FTD Software, the impact is lower than the CVSS score suggests because the affected web management interface allows for read access only.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the implementation of the Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocol in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to suboptimal processing that occurs when establishing a DTLS tunnel as part of an AnyConnect SSL VPN connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted DTLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected VPN headend device. This could cause existing DTLS tunnels to stop passing traffic and prevent new DTLS tunnels from establishing, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: When the attack traffic stops, the device recovers gracefully.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTPS request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the Snort detection engine integration for Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause unlimited memory consumption, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management for certain Snort events. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IP packets that would generate specific Snort events on an affected device. A sustained attack could cause an out of memory condition on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interrupt all traffic flowing through the affected device. In some circumstances, the attacker may be able to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes.&amp;amp;nbsp;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the integrated wireless access point (AP) packet processing of the Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;1000 Series Connected Grid Router (CGR1K) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
