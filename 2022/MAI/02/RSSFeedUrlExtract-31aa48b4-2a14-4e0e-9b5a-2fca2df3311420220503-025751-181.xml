<p>Palau&rsquo;s waters contain some of the world&rsquo;s richest marine biodiversity.<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/hawksbill-turtle"  target="_blank"> Critically endangered</a> <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/hawksbill-turtle"  target="_blank">hawksbill turtles</a> and <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/humphead-wrasse"  target="_blank">endangered Napoleon wrasse</a>, which can grow up to six feet long and are known for the distinctive bulge on their foreheads, cruise through reefs home to hundreds of species of coral.</p>
<p>The country, an archipelago of over 300 pristine tropical islands popping up out of the Pacific, has tried hard to protect its natural gifts.<a href="https://flyandsea.com/first-shark-sanctuary-in-palau/"  target="_blank"> In 2009</a>, it forbade the commercial fishing of sharks, creating the world&rsquo;s first national shark sanctuary. Species like dugongs and bumphead parrotfish are <a href="https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/2020/03/10/conservationists-nix-palau-legislators-proposal-to-end-the-26-year-old-fishing-ban-on-en#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Protection%20Act%20of%201994%20passed%20by%20the%204th,plants%20other%20than%20marine%20birds."  target="_blank">protected</a>. Tourists have to pay a $100 green fee on entry to the country to support local conservation, and sign a pledge written by the children of Palau to &ldquo;tread lightly, act kindly, and explore mindfully.&rdquo;<a href="https://time.com/5447739/palau-sunscreen-ban-coral/" > Sunscreen</a> that has ingredients that are toxic to reefs is banned.<br />

<p>But perhaps its most ambitious conservation initiative is the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS). Any kind of extractive activity, including fishing, has been banned in the PNMS, an area bigger than California, which comprises 80% of Palau&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), since January 2020. Not only can so-called<a href="https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1514684743329144832"  target="_blank"> marine protected areas (MPAs)</a> safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems but they are also important for the fight against climate change; they can prevent stores of seafloor carbon from being released from activities like trawling or resource extraction.</p>
<p>But the future of the PNMS&mdash;one of the largest marine protected areas<a href="https://mpatlas.org/large-mpas/"  target="_blank"> in the world</a>&mdash;looks uncertain. The government is now considering reducing the size of the PNMS to as little as 30% of the EEZ, in an attempt to increase economic activity to ease the hit COVID-19 has had on the country&rsquo;s finances.</p>
<p>Palau&rsquo;s struggle highlights questions of justice that countries around the world are facing as they grapple with how to balance biodiversity protection and climate action with economic growth: What contributions should developing nations have to make to protect biodiversity and the climate? Should they take a hit to their economic development, when climate change caused mostly by the world&#8217;s largest emitters, is the source of many of the ocean&#8217;s problems? Meanwhile, a global goal of protecting 30% of the world&rsquo;s oceans means Palau is doing far more for ocean protection than most countries.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Save our sanctuary!&#8221;</h2>
<p>The plan to reduce the size of the PNMS has sparked heated debate in Palau. As the<a href="https://time.com/6166419/john-kerry-ocean-climate-change-interview/" > Our Ocean conference</a> convened in Palau in mid-April, bringing together hundreds of officials, activists, and businesspeople from around the world to discuss ocean protection, a dozen or so youth activists, environmentalists, and fishermen gathered outside to protest the potential scaling down of the PNMS. &ldquo;Save our sanctuary! We know you can do it,&rdquo; they shouted as diplomats arrived in their black SUVs. &ldquo;Fishermen Want the Sanctuary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;People Not Profit,&rdquo; their signs read.</p>

<p>One petition to protect the sanctuary has gathered<a href="https://www.change.org/p/savemysanctuary-help-stop-the-destruction-of-one-of-the-world-s-largest-mpas"  target="_blank"> 2,600 signatures</a> (about 14% of Palau&rsquo;s population). The country&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.palaugov.pw/executive-branch/council-of-chiefs/"  target="_blank">Council of Chiefs</a>, a group of traditional chiefs that advises the president, <a href="https://islandtimes.org/chiefs-weigh-in-favor-of-keeping-the-pnms-as-is/"  target="_blank"> opposes the plan to roll back the sanctuary,</a> which was designed with the indigenous practice of &ldquo;bul&rdquo;-which calls for a moratorium on the use of resources to prevent damage to a habitat or species&ndash;in mind. Former president Tommy Remengesau Jr. has blasted the move to rollback one of his signature policies, and has said <a href="https://pina.com.fj/2022/04/12/former-palau-leader-fears-marine-sanctuary-act-could-be-ditched/"  target="_blank">the foreign fishing lobby</a> was trying to influence national leaders to allow them to fish in Palau again. Several local NGOs, the Palau Chamber of Commerce, a local fishing start-up fishing company, and some conservation societies showed up at a March public hearing to oppose the plan, according to the <a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank">Island <em>Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>But Palau&rsquo;s President Surangel Whipps Jr., who took office a year after the PNMS was enacted, and several others in the government want to reduce the size of the PNMS. Whipps says he&rsquo;s committed to protecting at least 30% of the EEZ, but the country needs to find a better balance between protection and production. Tourism, which accounted for almost<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/palau-to-welcome-first-tourists-in-a-year-with-presidential-escort"  target="_blank"> 50% of Palau&rsquo;s GDP</a> before the pandemic, has not yet made a comeback in a meaningful way. Palau&rsquo;s GDP dropped by 17% in 2021, according to the<a href="https://www.adb.org/countries/palau/economy"  target="_blank"> Asia Development Bank.</a> The Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Environment has reported that <a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank">$1.8 million</a> has been lost from banning fishing. Environmentalists argue that the PNMS has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in grants and donations to support conservation, but some in the government argue that money goes to non-profits, not to fund things like state governments, education, medical care, and the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These kids protesting&#8230;they say, &lsquo;We want 80% and you&rsquo;re bad, Mr. President. You&rsquo;re bad because you&rsquo;re trying to come up with a better plan,&rsquo;&rdquo; Whipps says. &ldquo;But they forget that what their protest[s are] saying is, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want money for our school lunch program. We don&rsquo;t want money to pay our teachers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipps says implementing the PNMS led to unintended consequences, like the closure of a foreign-run fishery that paid taxes, employed workers, ran a local processing facility, and provided Palau with cheap sources of protein by selling lower-grade tuna and other bycatch locally. After the ban,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/palaus-marine-sanctuary-backfires-leading-to-increased-consumption-of-reef-fish"  target="_blank"> foreign commercial fishing vessels</a> that could fish offshore for species like skipjack and yellowfin left Palau&rsquo;s waters, causing a shortage of tuna in the local market.</p>
<p>Now, he says, the country needs to do marine spatial planning&mdash;a process of analyzing and deciding what activities should be allowed in what space&mdash;to determine how to use their resources properly. &#8220;A lot of times people get hung up on numbers&mdash;80%, 30%. It shouldn&#8217;t be about numbers, it should be about the right size, the most effective way to do it,&#8221; he says. &ldquo;And then when you have these areas, they gotta be durable, and they gotta get the financing that sustains them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But some Palauans say that&rsquo;s short-sighted, and some local fishermen say they are making progress on developing local tuna fishing capabilities following the departure of foreign fishing boats. &ldquo;We have just started and we are growing. It is only the pandemic that is keeping us from expanding&#8230;Again, please don&rsquo;t open to foreign fishing boats,&#8221; Elia Yobech, who works for Belau Offshore Fisheries Inc., and fishes for tuna, among other species, said at a public hearing on the matter in March, according to the<a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank"> Island <em>Times</em></a>.</p>

<h2>&#8220;A much higher standard than the rest of the world?&#8221;</h2>
<p>Only about 2% of the world&rsquo;s oceans are covered by <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/marine-protected-areas-and-climate-change"  target="_blank">&ldquo;no-take&rdquo; MPAs</a> that ban fishing, mining, drilling, and other extractive industries, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But there is an international push to protect 30% of the world&rsquo;s land and ocean by 2030 (commonly referred to as &ldquo;30&#215;30&#8243;). The ocean is an important heat and carbon sink, helping to keep the global climate stable. Without this sort of protection, increasing water temperature and ocean acidification could be disastrous for much of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Some Pacific island nations, like Palau, have been way ahead of these efforts. Indeed, Palau has already set aside 80% of its waters, while the rest of the world is aiming to protect only 30%. And some are wondering why developing countries should suffer economically just for doing more for the planet than those wealthier than them. &ldquo;That&#8217;s a question that some of us have asked ourselves,&rdquo; says Steven Victor, Palau&#8217;s Minister of Fisheries, Agriculture and Environment. &ldquo;Why are we being held to a much higher standard than the rest of the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Victor says the 80% no-take zone may be constraining efforts to build the local fishery sector, which is important to improve food security, and questions what real impact the PNMS has on protecting global tuna stocks, a highly migratory species, unless others are making similar efforts. &#8220;To this day, no one can really articulate what we are trying to protect within 80%. We&#8217;re simply saying, &#8216;The bigger the better.&#8217; But at whose expense? The expense of the people of Palau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipps agrees that it is inequitable for Palau to restrict itself so much. &#8220;Is the warming water Palau&#8217;s fault? No. It&#8217;s large emitters. So if you can&#8217;t change your behavior, then I guess you better come to the table and pay for what you can&#8217;t if you can&#8217;t change,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Palau is a member of<a href="https://time.com/6137289/climate-change-responsibility/" > the Commission of Small Island States (COSIS) on Climate Change and International Law</a>, a group that seeks to hold the world&#8217;s largest emitters accountable for climate change-related destruction; COSIS aims to unite small-island countries to pursue climate judicial action through international courts.</p>

<p>But domestically, there are questions over who would benefit from opening the EEZ.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people whose lives are dependent on the ocean are actually benefiting from the design of the MPA right now, but they&#8217;re not at the discussion table,&#8221; says Ann Singeo, of the Ebiil Society, an environmental NGO that works with local fishermen.</p>
<p>She says Palau&#8217;s fishermen have already noticed a positive impact from the PNMS. &#8220;They&#8217;re catching [fish] 2-5 miles outside of the reef now, before they&#8217;d have to go 15-20 miles out,&#8221; she says, explaining that only people who can afford fuel or have a certain type of vessel can travel this distance. &#8220;This bill is just basically going to give away the waters to foreign corporations again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Palauans believe that ocean protection is in their country&rsquo;s DNA, in line with its <a href="https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/palau-chiefs-say-costs-outweigh-gains-from-opening-marine-sanctuary"  target="_blank">cultural and traditional values</a>, and that as a small-island developing state (SIDS) it should lead on climate efforts, given that SIDS are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Science tells us that our world has to fully-protect at least 30% of our world&rsquo;s oceans by 2030 for life on our planet earth to survive. And yet we are nowhere near that target,&#8221; Palau&#8217;s Council of Chiefs wrote in a statement that appeared in the <em>Ti Belau</em> newspaper during the Our Ocean conference. They added: &#8220;Without MPAs like PNMS, it is not only Palau who is at risk but our entire world.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the muddled debate over the future of Palau&rsquo;s sanctuary continues, that much is clear: The future of the oceans is at risk, and it puts the world&rsquo;s climate goals in peril. But to truly protect the world&rsquo;s oceans, the rest of the world will need to step up its action.</p>

<p>A Shanghai nursing home resident was mistakenly taken to the morgue while still alive, state media reported, as the city&rsquo;s Covid-19 outbreak and prolonged lockdown stretch aged-care and medical facilities to breaking point.</p>
<p>The municipal government confirmed the incident and said it has launched an investigation, local media reported. While the nursing home apologized, the error has triggered widespread anger and condemnation among Chinese people, according to discussions on social media.</p>
<p>The mistake comes as Shanghai&rsquo;s lockdown enters its fifth week and new COVID cases remain in the thousands each day. The tough restrictions and compulsory isolation of all virus cases and close contacts have created havoc in the city of 25 million, with people unable to access essential medical care. Most of the more than 400 deaths in the latest wave have been elderly people with underlying health conditions, with reports that some nursing homes weren&rsquo;t reporting deaths.<br />

<p>While it remains unclear whether the person was infected with Covid or vaccinated, the low inoculation rate among China&rsquo;s elderly remains the country&rsquo;s Achilles heel in the fight against the pandemic. In Shanghai, just 62% of residents over 60 years of age have been fully vaccinated, and only 15% of the population aged over 80 have received two shots. The average age of deaths reported Sunday was 84, according to the local government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is murder,&rdquo; one Weibo user wrote among a raft of other angry posts. &ldquo;The confidence crisis in the city is getting too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nursing care resident has been sent to the hospital for treatment and their vital signs are stabilizing, local media reported. The Bureau of Civil Affairs in the Putuo district where the home is located said it will handle the accident seriously and disclose the findings after the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with the epidemic, or any kind of normal negligence and irresponsibility, this is a serious dereliction of duty that almost led to death,&rdquo; Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the Communist Party backed <em>Global Times</em> newspaper and an influential commentator, <a href="https://weibo.com/1989660417/Lr7cS42qZ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his personal Weibo account.</p>

<p>LVIV, Ukraine &mdash; Hollywood actress and U.N. humanitarian Angelina Jolie made a surprise visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, the Lviv regional governor said on Telegram.</p>
<p>According to Maksym Kozytskyy, Jolie &mdash; who has been a UNHCR Special Envoy for Refugees since 2011 &mdash; had come to speak with displaced people who have found refuge in Lviv, including children undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April.</p>
<p>The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming Russian offensive, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very moved by (the children&rsquo;s) stories,&rdquo; Kozytskyy wrote. &ldquo;One girl was even able to privately tell Ms. Jolie about a dream she&rsquo;d had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said Jolie also visited a boarding school, talk with students and took photos with them, adding &#8220;she promised she would come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Kozytskyy, Jolie also met with evacuees arriving at Lviv&rsquo;s central railway station, as well as with Ukrainian volunteers providing the new arrivals with medical help and counseling,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The visit was a surprise to us all,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Plenty of people who saw Ms. Jolie in the Lviv region could not believe that it was really her. But since Feb. 24, Ukraine has shown the entire world that there are plenty of incredible things here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine &mdash; A long-awaited effort to evacuate people from a steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was underway Sunday, the United Nations said, while <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-congress-adam-schiff-b26d709f1e5e3cba71c3b67e47638746"  target="_blank">U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> revealed she visited Ukraine&#8217;s president to show unflinching American support for the country&#8217;s defense against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu told The Associated Press that the operation to bring people out of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done with the International Committee of the Red Cross and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials.</p>
<p>As many as 100,000 people are believed to still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians who were hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant &mdash; the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Abreu called the situation &ldquo;very complex&rdquo; and would not give further details. Like other evacuations, success of the mission in Mariupol depended on Russia and its forces, deployed along a long series of checkpoints before reaching Ukrainian ones.</p>
<p>Zaporizhzhia, a city about 141 miles (227 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol, is the expected destination of the evacuation effort. Zaporizhzhia was the destination of Mariupol residents who managed to flee the city on their own when previous Red Cross- and Ukrainian-organized evacuations had to be called off due to ongoing shelling or concerns about route safety.</p>
<p>The U.N. said the convoy to evacuate civilians started on Friday, travelling some 140 miles (230 kilometers) before reaching the plant in Mariupol on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a tweet Sunday afternoon that the first group of about 100 people was headed to Ukrainian-controlled territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll meet them in Zaporizhzhia. Grateful to our team! Now they, together with #UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a team with Doctors Without Borders was at a reception center for displaced people in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for the U.N. convoy&rsquo;s arrival, if successful. Stress, exhaustion and low supplies of food have likely weakened the health of civilians who have been trapped underground at the steel plant.</p>
<p>People fleeing Russian-occupied areas have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-boris-johnson-business-europe-58cfba68facfcc8b10d1e842e9cef6c4"  target="_blank">Russia&#8217;s high-stakes offensive</a> in coastal southern Ukraine and the country&rsquo;s eastern industrial heartland has Ukrainian forces fighting village-by-village and more civilians fleeing airstrikes and artillery shelling as war draws near their doorsteps.</p>
<p>Pelosi, a California Democrat who is second in line to succeed the president, is the most senior American lawmaker to travel to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Her Saturday visit came just days after Russia launched rockets at the capital during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres.</p>
<p>During a Sunday news conference in the Polish city of Rzeszow, Pelosi said she and other members of a U.S. congressional delegation met with Zelenskyy in Ukraine&#8217;s capital, Kyiv, for three hours and brought him &ldquo;a message of appreciation from the American people for his leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rep. Jason Crow, a U.S. Army veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, said he came to Ukraine with three areas of focus: &ldquo;Weapons, weapons and weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to win. What we have seen in the last two months is their ferocity, their intense pride, their ability to fight and their ability to win if they have the support to do so,&rdquo; the Colorado Democrat said.</p>
<p>Russian forces have embarked on a major military operation to seize significant parts of southern and eastern Ukraine following their failure to capture the capital, Kyiv. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, is a key target because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the leaders of the free world know what Russia has done to Mariupol. And Russia will not go unpunished for this,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. He warned that Russia was &ldquo;gathering additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Limited evacuations from the city took place on Saturday, but the details had been unclear given the number of parties involved in the negotiations and the volatile situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry said a total of 46 people were evacuated from areas near the Azovstal plant.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ukrainian regiment Deputy Commander Sviatoslav Palamar called for the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian fighters as well as civilians. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why they are not taken away and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,&rdquo; he said in a video posted on the regiment&#8217;s Telegram channel.</p>
<p>Undeterred by air raid sirens and warnings to shelter at home, people in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia visited cemeteries Sunday, when Ukrainians observe the Orthodox Christian day of the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If our dead could rise and see this, they would say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not possible, they&rsquo;re worse than the Germans,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hennadiy Bondarenko, 61, said while marking the day with his family at a picnic table among the graves. &ldquo;All our dead would join the fighting, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e2dcda041fa84a7192093bfe98dea55a"  target="_blank">including the Cossacks</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Also, both Ukraine and Moscow-backed rebels have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone.</p>
<p>But Western military analysts have suggested the offensive in the Donbas region, which includes Mariupol, was going much slower than planned. So far, Russian troops and the separatists appeared to have made only minor gains in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in the east.</p>
<p>Video and images from inside the Mariupol steel plant, shared with The Associated Press by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands are among the fighters refusing to surrender there, showed unidentified men with stained bandages; others had open wounds or amputated limbs.</p>
<p>A skeleton medical staff was treating at least 600 wounded people, said the women, who identified their husbands as members of the Azov Regiment of Ukraine&rsquo;s National Guard. Some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene, they said.</p>
<p>The AP could not independently verify the date and location of the video, which the women said was taken in the last week in the maze of corridors and bunkers beneath the plant.</p>
<p>Numerically, Russia&rsquo;s military manpower vastly exceeds Ukraine&rsquo;s. In the days before the war began, Western intelligence estimated Russia had positioned near the border as many as 190,000 troops; Ukraine&rsquo;s standing military totals about 200,000, spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>With plenty of firepower still in reserve, Russia&rsquo;s offensive still could intensify and overrun the Ukrainians. Overall the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel. Russia also has a much larger air force and navy.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance has flowed into Ukraine since the war began, but Russia&#8217;s vast armories mean Ukraine will continue to require huge amounts of support.</p>

<p>U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met Ukraine&rsquo;s president on Saturday in a previously unannounced visit to Kyiv, telling him that &ldquo;your fight is a fight for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pelosi, second in line to the U.S. presidency, became the highest-ranked American official to travel to the country since Russia&rsquo;s invasion. Her visit follows one last weekend by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our delegation traveled to Kyiv to send an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire world: America stands firmly with Ukraine,&rdquo; Pelosi said in a statement released by her office on Sunday.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky showed footage of Pelosi&rsquo;s visit on his Ukrainian-language Twitter account early Sunday. &ldquo;Thank you for helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state!&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>The video showed Zelenskiy shaking hands with Pelosi and other U.S. lawmakers on the streets of Kyiv, including Democrats Gregory Meeks of New York, Adam Schiff of California, Jason Crow of Colorado and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done,&rdquo; Pelosi told Zelenskiy in the video.</p>

<p>Saturday night&rsquo;s meeting with Zelenskiy lasted for three hours, Schiff said Sunday at a media briefing in Rzeszow, Poland, close to the border with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized the importance of &ldquo;good and timely&rdquo; U.S. intelligence cooperation with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s delegation will travel on to Warsaw, where they&rsquo;ll meet with President Andrzej Duda and senior officials, according to the earlier statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we return to the United States, we will do so further informed, deeply inspired and ready to do what is needed to help the Ukrainian people as they defend democracy for their nation and for the world,&rdquo; Pelosi said.</p>

Pelosi on Friday termed the aid package &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and vowed to pass it as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="ng-star-inserted">
<p>PARIS &mdash; Citizens and trade unions in cities around Europe were taking to the streets on Sunday for May Day marches, and to put out protest messages to their governments, notably in France where the holiday to honor workers was being used as a rallying cry against newly reelected President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>May Day is a time of high emotion for participants and their causes, with police on the ready. Turkish police moved in quickly in Istanbul and encircled protesters near the barred-off Taksim Square &mdash; where 34 people were killed In 1977 during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>On Sunday, police detained 164 people for demonstrating without permits and resisting police at the square, the Istanbul governor&#8217;s office said. At a site on the Asian side of Istanbul, a May Day gathering drew thousands, singing, chanting and waving banners, a demonstration organized by the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey.</p>
<p>In Italy, after a two-year pandemic lull, an outdoor mega-concert was set for Rome with rallies and protests in cities across the country. Besides work, peace was an underlying theme with calls for an end to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s three main labor unions were focusing their main rally in the hilltop town of Assisi, a frequent destination for peace protests. This year&rsquo;s slogan is &ldquo;Working for peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a May Day of social and civil commitment for peace and labor,&rdquo; said the head of Italy&rsquo;s CISL union, Daniela Fumarola.</p>
<p>Other protests were planned far and wide in Europe, including in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where students and others planned to rally in support of Ukraine as Communists, anarchists and anti-European Union groups held their own gatherings.</p>
<p>In France, the May Day rallies &mdash; a week after the presidential election &mdash; are aimed at showing Macron the opposition he could face in his second five-year term and to power up against his centrists before June legislative elections. Opposition parties, notably the far left and far right, are looking to break his government&rsquo;s majority.</p>
<p>Protests were planned across France with a focus on Paris where the Communist-backed CGT union was leading the main march through eastern Paris, joined by a handful of other unions. All are pressing Macron for policies that put the people first and condemning his plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65.</p>
<p>In a first, far-right leader Marine Le Pen was absent from her party&rsquo;s traditional wreath-laying at the foot of a statue of Joan of Arc, replaced by the interim president of her National Rally party. Le Pen was defeated by Macron in last Sunday&#8217;s runoff of the presidential election, and plans to campaign to keep her seat as a lawmaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell the French that the voting isn&rsquo;t over. There is a third round, the legislative elections,&rdquo; said Jordan Bardella, &ldquo;and it would be unbelievable to leave full power to Emmanuel Macron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>KHARKIV, Ukraine &mdash; Ukrainian forces fought village by village Saturday to hold back a Russian advance through the country&rsquo;s east, while the United Nations worked to broker a civilian evacuation from the last defensive stronghold in the bombed-out ruins of the port city of Mariupol.</p>
<p>An estimated 100,000 civilians remain in the city, and up to 1,000 are living beneath a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-moscow-67da12473ccd75fe02992f0eb751c5f4"  target="_blank">sprawling Soviet-era steel plant</a>, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine has not said how many fighters are also in the plant, the only part of Mariupol not occupied by Russian forces, but Russia put the number at about 2,000.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Russian state media outlets reported Saturday that 25 civilians had been evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks, though there was no confirmation from U.N. or Ukrainian officials. Russia&#8217;s RIA Novosti news agency said 19 adults and six children were brought out, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Video and images from inside the plant, shared with The Associated Press by two Ukrainian women who said their <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-united-nations-evacuations-dfa926cbc0385471542d47fbb98ebb63"  target="_blank">husbands are among the fighters</a> refusing to surrender there, showed unidentified men with stained bandages; others had open wounds or amputated limbs.</p>
<p>A skeleton medical staff was treating at least 600 wounded people, said the women, who identified their husbands as members of the Azov Regiment of Ukraine&rsquo;s National Guard. Some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene, they said.</p>
<p>In the video the men said that they eat just once daily and share as little as 1.5 liters (50 ounces) of water a day among four people, and that supplies inside the besieged facility are depleted.</p>
<p>The AP could not independently verify the date and location of the video, which the women said was taken in the last week in the warren of passageways beneath the plant.</p>
<p>One shirtless man appeared to be in pain as he described his wounds: two broken ribs, a punctured lung and a dislocated arm that &ldquo;was hanging on the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell everyone who sees this: If you will not stop this here, in Ukraine, it will go further, to Europe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>&mdash; Lines formed at gas stations in Kyiv, Dnipro and other cities as Ukraine faced fuel shortages because Russia has destroyed its fuel infrastructure and blocked ports, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his Friday address. He said there were &ldquo;no immediate solutions&#8221; to the shortages, but hoped the situation would improve in the next week or two.</p>
<p>&mdash; The bodies of three men were found buried in a forest near the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, the head of Kyiv&rsquo;s regional police force said. The men, whose bodies were found Friday, had been tortured before they were shot in the head, Andriy Nebytov wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian officials have alleged that retreating Russian troops carried out mass killings of civilians in Bucha.</p>
<p>&mdash; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview that Russian and Ukrainian negotiators talk &ldquo;almost every day.&rdquo; However, he told Chinese state news agency Xinhua, &ldquo;progress has not been easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; Two buses sent to evacuate residents from the eastern town of Popasna were fired upon, and contact with the organizers was lost, Mayor Nikolai Khanatov said: &ldquo;We know that (the buses) reached the town and then came under fire from an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; A Russian rocket attack destroyed the airport runway in Odesa, Ukraine&rsquo;s third-most populous city and a key Black Sea port, the Ukrainian army said.</p>
<p>Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Also, both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone.</p>
<p>But Western military analysts suggested that Moscow&rsquo;s offensive in the Donbas region, which includes Mariupol, was going much slower than planned. So far, Russia&rsquo;s troops and the separatists appeared to have made only minor gains in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in the east.</p>
<p>Numerically, Russia&rsquo;s military manpower vastly exceeds Ukraine&rsquo;s. In the days before the war began, Western intelligence estimated Russia had positioned near the border as many as 190,000 troops; Ukraine&rsquo;s standing military totals about 200,000, spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>Yet, in part because of the tenacity of the Ukrainian resistance, the U.S. believes the Russians are &ldquo;at least several days behind where they wanted to be&rdquo; as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the American military&rsquo;s assessment.</p>
<p>With plenty of firepower still in reserve, Russia&rsquo;s offensive still could intensify and overrun the Ukrainians. Overall the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel. Russia also has a much larger air force and navy.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance has flowed into Ukraine since the war began, but Russia&#8217;s vast armories mean Ukraine&#8217;s needs are nearly inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Mariupol officials have described dire shortages of food, water and medicine. U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu said the world organization was negotiating with authorities in Moscow and Kyiv, but he could not provide details of the ongoing evacuation effort &#8220;because of the complexity and fluidity of the operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, right now, ongoing, high-level engagements with all the governments, Russia and Ukraine, to make sure that you can save civilians and support the evacuation of civilians from the plant,&rdquo; Abreu told AP. He would not confirm video posted on social media purportedly showing U.N.-marked vehicles in Mariupol.</p>
<p>Ukraine has blamed the failure of numerous previous evacuation attempts on continued Russian shelling.</p>
<p>The ferocity of the fighting has stunned the world. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOMO34-UWTI"  target="_blank">In the U.S., Pentagon press secretary John Kirby grew emotional Friday</a> as he discussed the invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to look at what he&rsquo;s doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that,&rdquo; Kirby, a retired rear admiral, told reporters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. So, I can&rsquo;t talk to his psychology. But I think we can all speak to his depravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those in the Mariupol steel plant, a vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers has provided safety from airstrikes. But <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-business-europe-893384be23cf0fc1c0b9e566de372046"  target="_blank">the situation has grown more dire</a> after the Russians dropped &ldquo;bunker busters&rdquo; and other bombs on the plant, the mayor said Friday.</p>
<p>The women who said their husbands are in the plant with the Azov Regiment said they feared soldiers will be tortured and killed if they are left behind and captured.</p>
<p>The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has referred to the regiment&#8217;s past while attempting to justify the invasion.</p>

<p>Shanghai&rsquo;s measures to stem community spread of Covid will remain in place, even as infections drop and the city reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-30/shanghai-says-all-new-covid-cases-friday-found-in-quarantine"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no new cases</a> outside quarantined areas on Friday for the first time since the recent outbreak started.</p>
<p>The financial hub&rsquo;s fight against the outbreak &ldquo;remains in a crucial stage,&rdquo; as the situation is still &ldquo;severe and complex,&rdquo; Zhao Dandan, deputy head of the local health commission, told a briefing Saturday, without addressing the significance of the new numbers.</p>
<p>The city of 25 million reported 10,181 new infections April 29, down from 15,032 the previous day. All were either found in lockdown or were reclassified from previously known asymptomatic cases, according to a statement Saturday.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s economic activity contracted sharply in April as the lockdown of Shanghai and other areas around the country to contain the spread of Covid-19 closed factories, snarled roads and stopped people from consuming, escalating concerns about further disruption to global supply chains.</p>
<p>The slump was widespread in April, with factory output contracting further and services demand much weaker than forecast. The purchasing managers indexes are the first official April data and show the extent of the damage to the economy due to the outbreak and the government&rsquo;s Covid Zero policies.</p>
<p>While Shanghai makes progress toward halting community spread, a crucial milestone in its disruptive containment effort to bring the city&rsquo;s worst outbreak under control, Beijing is tightening measures as the capital seeks to prevent its flareup from growing.</p>
<p>From May 5, people in Beijing will be required to show negative Covid test results taken within the last seven days to enter public venues or to use the transit system. Beijing shut down cinemas during the five-day Labor Day holiday that starts Saturday, the Beijing Daily <a href="https://bj.bjd.com.cn/5b165687a010550e5ddc0e6a/contentShare/5b16573ae4b02a9fe2d558f9/AP626c88d7e4b0e94cca8802e9.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier.</p>
<p>The local health commission announced a rollout of &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; mass tests to all 22 million citizens after the holiday, according to its <a href="https://view.inews.qq.com/a/20220430A08FMG00"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saturday press conference</a>. It requires swabs to be done at least once in a week after the first round of three tests completed on Friday filtered 295 infections. An outbreak involving schoolchildren a week ago put several communities under lockdown, unprecedented in China&rsquo;s political center.</p>
<p>Beijing will also suspend dining-in at restaurants during the holidays, and said it will increase efforts to ensure food delivery. It added 4,000 hospital beds for Covid infections, and is working on building more shelter hospitals to ease medical care strains.</p>
<p>Chinese officials are now more focused on curtailing the spread of the virus within communities rather than seeking to reduce the caseload to absolute zero as the highly infectious omicron variant poses unprecedented challenges to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/china-defends-covid-zero-for-turning-around-worst-outbreak"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Covid Zero</a> strategy.</p>
<p>The nationwide tally of new confirmed Covid cases also eased to 1,424 Friday, from 5,659 the previous day, according to the health ministry.</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens shouldn&rsquo;t relax efforts to stem the community spread of the virus, and elderly residents should get vaccinated as soon as possible, Zhao said. The city reported 47 deaths of infected patients on Friday. They had an average age of 82.4, all died from underlying diseases and only three were vaccinated.</p>
<p>The city will keep pushing for more businesses to resume services, after companies in the first batch, including Tesla Inc., were already allowed to do so, an official told the briefing.</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6172292/russia-ukraine-invasion-energy/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Russia has always used energy as a weapon to influence, coerce, and terrorize its neighbors and perceived enemies to the West. Now, cornered but far from crippled by sanctions that initially did not include energy exports and still do not in Europe, Putin is using his colossal energy power to retaliate.</p>
<p>Energy, of course, is a weapon of war. Putin&rsquo;s army is targeting Ukrainian fuel depots, supply chains, and refineries in its brutal assault. Cutting off the other side&rsquo;s access to gasoline, diesel, and oil is a tried and true tactic to gain a military upper hand. Ukraine may also have targeted Russian fuel storage facilities, according to reports of a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-01/card/oil-refinery-that-supplies-ukrainian-troops-damaged-russian-military-says-IKfOM1wB0vgNZc0FutsO"  target="_blank">strike on an oil depot</a> in Belgorod, Russia.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s energy warfare is now spilling outside Ukraine. The late April 26 <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/04/26/russia-s-gazprom-suspends-supplies-to-poland-and-bulgaria"  target="_blank">decision</a> by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom to cut off natural gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61240499"  target="_blank">blackmail</a>,&rdquo; as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. But the move was not unexpected for any student of recent Russian history.</p>
<p>The efficacy of energy as a foreign policy tool is something Russia grasped long ago, although it has used it more as the proverbial stick than carrot. It <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-ukraine-gas-timeline-sb/timeline-gas-crises-between-russia-and-ukraine-idUSTRE50A1A720090111"  target="_blank">shut off gas</a> to Ukraine and neighboring European countries in 2009, one of numerous such episodes, in an effort to force Ukraine to its knees in the midst of a brutal winter. It worked. Kyiv was forced to accept a deeply disadvantageous ten-year gas transit deal with Moscow, among other concessions. Russia did it again to Ukraine in 2014 over a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-cuts-gas-to-ukraine/"  target="_blank">payment dispute</a>.</p>
<p>The Russia-Europe-U.S. fight over Putin&rsquo;s <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11138"  target="_blank">Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline</a>, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germanys-scholz-halts-nord-stream-2-certification-2022-02-22/"  target="_blank">Germany forswore</a> only after Putin invaded Ukraine, is another of many examples. The 1,224 km, 55 billion cubic meter (bcm) capacity submarine natural gas pipeline from Ust-Luga, Russia (near the Estonian border) to Greifswald, Germany was never necessary for gas transit purposes. Europe already has 245 bcm pipeline capacity connecting it to Russia, with over 100 bcm unused. Rather, Russia wanted to bypass Ukraine as a gas transit country, and to deepen Germany&rsquo;s dependency on Russian gas so that Europe would be too paralyzed by energy fears to oppose its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thus far, Russia is winning at this game. The war he started may not be going Putin&rsquo;s way, but his gamble that Europe and much of the developing world would be too insecure about energy to mount a meaningful reaction when he moved into Ukraine has arguably proved true thus far. Despite Germany&rsquo;s April 28 announcement that it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/scholz-says-germany-must-prepare-possible-russian-gas-export-stop-2022-04-28/"  target="_blank">drop its opposition</a> to imposing an E.U. energy embargo&mdash;at least on oil and natural gas&mdash;against Russia, there remains a difficult negotiation among member states as to what form such a ban would take, and its timeline. Thus far, it therefore remains true that the E.U. has failed to follow the U.S. (mostly symbolic, because it imports very little fuel from Russia) lead in instituting an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/08/fact-sheet-united-states-bans-imports-of-russian-oil-liquefied-natural-gas-and-coal/"  target="_blank">energy embargo</a> against Russia.</p>
<p>In 2021, 60% of Russia&rsquo;s revenues were from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-siphon-putin-oil-revenue-import-natural-gas-sanctions-gulf-iran-venezuela-ukraine-fracking-fossil-fuels-11646751482"  target="_blank">energy exports</a>. While, as of April 7, Europe had given Kyiv over &euro;1 billion to support Ukraine&rsquo;s fight against the Russian invasion, it paid Russia <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/04/06/eu-has-spent-35bn-on-russian-energy-and-just-1bn-on-aid-borrell"  target="_blank">&euro;35 billion</a> for energy imports during that same period. In other words, Europe has been paying for Russia&rsquo;s attack on its smaller, democratic neighbor with one hand because it is still buying Russian energy exports, while sanctioning other Russian activities with the other. Even while E.U. countries pour weapons and aid into Ukraine, they have not yet forced themselves to defang the Russian bear.</p>
<p>It is not only Europe&rsquo;s failing, however. The United States, despite its own oil and gas embargo on Russia (which <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/russia-oil-ukraine-biden-00014873"  target="_blank">the White House fought</a> to avoid imposing), cannot bring itself to break off Russian uranium imports. It still <a href="https://fpif.org/russia-and-u-s-uranium/"  target="_blank">imports 16%</a> or more of its uranium from a country that over <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/3260961-70-percent-of-americans-view-russia-as-their-enemy-survey/"  target="_blank">70% of Americans</a> believe to be an enemy. Meanwhile, India, for example, continues to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60783874"  target="_blank">buy Russian Urals crude</a> oil that most of the world has shunned. Perhaps worst of all, Bloomberg reported that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-27/four-european-gas-buyers-made-ruble-payments-to-russia"  target="_blank">ten European countries</a> have opened bank accounts at Gazprombank through which to comply with Russia&rsquo;s demand to be paid in rubles, even though such payments may violate existing sanctions on financial transfers.</p>
<p>Russia has enjoyed this leverage because it is an energy and commodity <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/russia-the-21st-centurys-energy-superpower/"  target="_blank">superpower</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/schroder-germany-russia-gas-ukraine-war-energy.html"  target="_blank">largest oil exporter</a> on earth and the runner up on crude exports, it also supplies the European Union with about 40-45% of its natural gas&mdash;and as much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60925016"  target="_blank">as 80% of Austria&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/schroder-germany-russia-gas-ukraine-war-energy.html"  target="_blank">55% of Germany&rsquo;s</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-become-almost-independent-russian-gas-h2-2023-paper-2022-04-21/"  target="_blank">40% of Italy&rsquo;s</a>, among others. It also boasts <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/30/russias-role-in-worlds-nuclear-energy-industry-prompts-calls-to-up-u-s-uranium-production/"  target="_blank">40% of the world&rsquo;s uranium enrichment</a> capacity, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-can-hold-nickel-hostage-metals-mining-environment-china-class-domestic-electric-vehicles-11647287911"  target="_blank">20% of class 1 nickel</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/palladium-propelled-record-highs-by-russia-supply-concerns-2022-03-07/"  target="_blank">30% of global palladium</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>On April 26 Russia flexed these energy muscles against Poland and Bulgaria. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/GazpromEN/status/1519208376013664256?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet%7Ctwtr%5Etrue"  target="_blank">Tweet</a>, it announced that &ldquo;Gazprom fully halts gas supplies to Bulgaria&rsquo;s Bulgargaz and Poland&rsquo;s PGNiG due to their failure to pay in rubles.&rdquo; Nominally, the justification as claimed is that these E.U. countries refused to acquiesce to Gazprom&rsquo;s demands that its existing contracts now be paid, in violation of those contracts&rsquo; terms, in Russian <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-27/gazprom-says-it-cuts-gas-to-poland-bulgaria-on-non-payment"  target="_blank">rubles instead of U.S. dollars</a>. The switch is an effort by Russia to prop up its faltering currency, and economy more broadly.</p>
<p>Neither Poland nor Bulgaria has given into the blackmail, despite their dependence on Russian natural gas. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/russia-to-halt-gas-supply-to-poland-government-told"  target="_blank">Poland imports 55%</a> of its consumption from the east; for Bulgaria it is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61240499"  target="_blank">90%</a>. Losing these imports puts the populations of both at risk of freezing this winter. Regardless, they have been defiant since Gazprom&rsquo;s announcement. Given both countries&rsquo; calls for stronger sanctions against Russia and more robust military support for Ukraine, Putin cannot reasonably have believed they would make the switch to rubles.</p>
<p>The more likely goal was scaring Europe sufficiently that the Union&rsquo;s current inability&mdash;now at least six weeks deep&mdash;to agree on an embargo against Russian oil and gas would persist. Each vulnerable European country may rightly fear that it could be next. And despite some reports that Germany, Italy, and maybe even Hungary are softening in their opposition to a full-scale ban on Russian energy, no decision has been reached. Germany&rsquo;s April 28 agreement to an embargo remains theoretical until the details are hammered out with its fellow E.U. countries, which promises to be a very difficult negotiation. Meanwhile, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russia-natural-gas-germany-ruble-payment-poland-bulgaria-cut-off-2022-4"  target="_blank">gas prices rose 28%</a> on April 27, making fears of provoking Russia into causing a catastrophic energy crisis seem all the more reasonable. Of course, such is Putin&rsquo;s calculus.</p>
<p>The European struggle to end its dependence on Russian oil, gas, and coal is a sharp lesson in how vulnerable energy insecurity can leave countries. If war is the continuation of diplomacy by other means (a misquote of <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2022/march/what-would-clausewitz-say-about-putins-war-ukraine"  target="_blank">Carl von Clausewitz</a>, but a great one), then weaponized energy is the greatest diplomatic tool of all. Until the world proves it otherwise, Russia is still the master at wielding it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-Palestine activists have a long history of experiencing smear attacks targeting their places of employment or study. When</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hadi Nasrallah tweeted a video </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of protestors </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-59240890"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confronting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely after a late 2021 speaking engagement, he attracted the attention of David Collier. Collier has a large following, describes himself as a journalist and anti-semitism researcher, and has targeted supporters of Palestine and conflated critiques of Israel with anti-semitism in the past. Collier, who refers to Nasrallah as an &ldquo;extremist,&rdquo; began sharing personal images from Nasrallah&#8217;s Facebook account. Nasrallah reported these tweets and in response, Twitter </span><a href="https://david-collier.com/nasrallah/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">locked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Collier out of his account until he deleted the tweets that violated Twitter&rsquo;s rules on sharing private media. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Twitter is vital for Palestinian activists as it allows them to speak about their oppression in their own words, with a less likely chance of being censored like on other social media platforms,&rdquo; says Farah Koutteineh, the Head of Public Relations at the Palestinian Return Centre, which focuses on the issue of Palestinian refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Arab Spring, to the 2020 racial justice uprisings in the US, to worker-led boycotts in South Africa, and Gazans documenting the toll of Israeli attacks, Twitter has played a vital role for social justice movements across the world. When comparing content moderation approaches across platforms, Twitter sets a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/tech/twitter-free-speech-elon-musk/index.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high</span></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/technology/twitter-musk-content-moderators.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its enforcement of community guidelines. Activists have noted Twitter&rsquo;s enforcement of community guidelines, which generally keep them safer from harassment than they feel on other platforms. Twitter goes farther than other social media outlets, and has banned users who violate its terms. (Famously, Donald Trump was banned from the platform for inciting violence during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the capitol.) Now that Elon Musk has a deal to buy the platform, organizers who use it&mdash;especially those from marginalized groups&mdash;are unsure what to expect. Musk has been a vocal critic of both the guidelines and the Twitter executives who enforce them and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518677066325053441?s=20&amp;t=BQ62FqVPF1DOfyXhpLAxkw"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to uphold freedom of expression. In a TED interview in April, he said he&rsquo;s more in favor of temporary punishments for violations rather than permanent bans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roy Yellin, the public outreach manager of B&rsquo;tselem, says that Twitter and social media coverage have shifted understandings of Israeli attacks in Gaza by &ldquo;reversing the narrative that accompanied previous Israeli operations that Hamas was shooting rockets and Israel was retaliating to that&rdquo; and instead reflecting the stance of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/world/middleeast/israel-apartheid-palestinians-hrw.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">human rights</span></a> <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that accuse Israel of apartheid.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Ilia Yefimovich&mdash;picture alliance/Getty Images</span><span class="caption" >Palestinian and Israeli activists take part in a weekly protest in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, against the eviction of Palestinian families in favor of Jewish settlers, on Feb. 18, 2022.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinovimbanashe Gwenyaya, a former trade unionist in South Africa, has also seen the power of Twitter first hand. When workers at his union went on strike and then launched a boycott against the company, they turned to Twitter to raise awareness among South African customers while the company hired replacement workers. Prior to that, as a university student in South Africa he helped organize students campaigning against the Robert Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe, and Twitter helped spread the word about their marches and solidarity campaigns. &ldquo;Twitter has played an important role in mobilizing people in historic ways,&rdquo; says Gwenyaya, &ldquo;where the marginalized can express their opinions freely against oppression, exploitation, dictatorships, regimes that seek to suppress free speech.&rdquo; Gwenyaya argues that Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;right-wing understanding of free speech&rdquo; places that at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many groups have found the platform useful and safe enough for organizing, they&rsquo;ve still experienced harassment on it. Koutteineh fears the racist and Islamophobic harassment, death threats and defamation campaigns activists already face on the platform will increase under Musk&rsquo;s leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor activists, who have also faced harassment and defamation campaigns online when they organize, echo these concerns, pointing to Musk&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/business/musk-labor-board.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-union </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">actions at his other company, Tesla, that earned him censure from the National Labor Relations Board. &ldquo;How will Elon Musk respond to tweets against Tesla&rsquo;s working conditions or environmental pollution? Will he tolerate tweets criticizing him?&rdquo; says Gahyun Lee who was the first woman president of the Arbeit workers union in South Korea working with minimum wage and part-time workers. Musk has a </span><a href="https://popular.info/p/musk-is-a-free-speech-absolutist?s=r"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of going after critics both inside and outside of Tesla, but has </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518623997054918657?s=20&amp;t=BQ62FqVPF1DOfyXhpLAxkw"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he hopes his critics remain on Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Twitter under Elon Musk would make an already deadly Twitter even more lethal for our communities and democracies across South Asia,&rdquo; says Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, which organizes with South Asian religious and cultural minorities for an end to caste apartheid. Religious and caste-oppressed minorities in India face intense vitriol online including smear campaigns, harassment, disinformation, trolling, threats of rape, violence to both themselves and their loved ones. she says. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519036983137509376?s=20&amp;t=BQ62FqVPF1DOfyXhpLAxkw"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clarified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his commitment to free speech refers to that which is defined by governments which captures the will of the people, and India also demonstrates the limitations of this approach. Under a Hindu nationalist government, hate speech and violence against Muslims spreads quickly online and offline. &ldquo;This kind of complete trust of government is ridiculous,&rdquo; says Yellin, of B&rsquo;tselem, &ldquo;We know governments can be the best protectors of human rights and the most dangerous violators of human rights.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk has also proposed eliminating anonymous profiles. Across the United States during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 and prior, anonymous accounts have played a major role in coordinating public actions. &ldquo;What an enforced real-name policy means is that Twitter will not facilitate the organizing efforts of those in struggle against racialized police violence,&rdquo; says Sarah Hamid, Campaign Lead at the Carceral Tech Resistance Network which supports abolitionist organizing campaigns.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Spencer Platt&mdash;Getty Images</span><span class="caption" >Black Lives Matter supporters and others march across the Brooklyn Bridge to honor George Floyd on the one year anniversary of his death on May 25, 2021.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Twitter enables communities to build connections and unite during protests, such connections also carry risks, regardless of who owns the company. As networks are built on a public website, they are subject to the surveillance of companies like Dataminr who have been </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/21/dataminr-twitter-surveillance-racial-profiling/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of racially profiling individuals when identifying potential &ldquo;gang members&rdquo; or &ldquo;threats&rdquo; for local police departments. Dataminr did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katrina, a member of the Black Liberation Collective in Vermont who declined to share her last name, did not wish to speculate on what Musk will do, but doubts it will favor grassroots organizers like herself. &ldquo;Ultimately he&rsquo;ll implement whatever he wants to do in a way that will serve him, and as a poor, disabled Black fat woman, there&rsquo;s a recognition I have that it could be anything in any given moment.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty around Twitter&rsquo;s future has created an opportunity for organizers to reassess their relationship with the platform. Movements for social justice predate social media and successful organizers are profoundly creative. &ldquo;This work is cobbled together from hundreds of experiments, and our tactics have to evolve and shift continuously,&rdquo; says Hamid, &ldquo;Our work doesn&#8217;t stop because of Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter &mdash; we just move on and find other ways to activate, coordinate, and mobilize.&rdquo; </span></p>
