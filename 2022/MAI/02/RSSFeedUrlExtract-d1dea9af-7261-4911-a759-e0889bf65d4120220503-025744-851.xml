<p>VLADIMIR Putin has taken full control of the Ukraine invasion after making impossible demands to his generals, it&#8217;s been reported.</p>



<p>According to claims, the Russian leader left his officers in &#8220;shock&#8221; by making impossible demands as he changes his strategy to fous on the annexing of Eastern Ukraine.</p>



<p>Thwarted in his bid to seize Kyiv, the capital, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shifted his focus to the Donbas, Ukraine&#8217;s industrial heartland, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014.</p>



<p>Russia said it struck dozens of military targets in the region, including concentrations of troops and weapons and an ammunition depot near Chervone in the Zaporizhzhia region, west of the Donbas.</p>



<p>According to Express.co.uk, a senior EU source told Eurasia Group CEO Mujtaba Rahman that Putin had &#8220;now taken day-to day-control of the conflict&#8221;.</p>



<p>He claimed the despot has the central city of Kryvvi Rih as a new target, with Russian forces thought to be just 50km away.</p>



<p>Social media user &#8220;UOI&#8221;, a frequent commentator on events in Ukraine, wrote: &#8220;Putin is demanding that General, Dvornikov take Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky&#8217;s homeland, by May 9.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are told from communication interceptions that Russian officers are simply in shock.</p>



<p>&#8220;They have losses of 400 soldiers a day killed and wounded, and their equipment keeps breaking down.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has failed in a bid to be let out of prison early, according to reports.</p>



<p>Christian B has allegedly been denied parole over the rape of a pensioner in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/praia-da-luz/">Praia da Luz</a> after serving half his sentence.</p>

<p>The decision panel are understood to have held concerns that he was at &#8220;high risk of reoffending&#8221;. </p>



<p>He will remain in prison until at least May 2023 when he can make another parole application, according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/madeleine-mccann-prime-suspect-branded-26853043">Mirror</a>.</p>



<p>Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told the publication: “His request was rejected on the grounds that he could not be given a positive social prognosis.</p>



<p>“In other words, the court has said it believes that the convict will commit further offences if released.” </p>

<p>The woman spent <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11800974/madeleine-mccann-suspect-rape-victim/">two days with</a> investigators recounting her ordeal in September 2005 — two years before <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2238940/madeleine-mccann-investigation-latest-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club complex in the same Algarve resort</a>.</p>



<p>Christian B escaped justice for 12 years before he was nailed by DNA evidence taken from a hair at the scene. </p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Oldenburg District Court said: “The court ruled there were no grounds for suspending the remainder of the sentence.”&nbsp; </p>



<p>The decision will likely be welcomed by investigators working to find links between Christian B to McCann&#8217;s disappearance. </p>

<p>Wolters&nbsp;believes more &#8220;developments&#8221; are likely within the next three weeks. </p>



<p>Christian B has denied any involvement and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18437253/madeleine-mccann-accused-claims-woman-sex-cops-alibi/">claims he was miles away having sex with a woman in his camper van</a> at the time Madeleine vanished. </p>



<p>He has said that the next day they were stopped on the way to Faro Airport and had their picture taken at a roadblock. </p>



<p>He claimed the woman was arrested at the airport for carrying a pepper spray &#8211; however an arrest report indicates she was actually detained a week after Madeleine disappeared. </p>



<p>Cops recently forensically tested McCann suspect Christian B&#8217;s van after he was quizzed for first time about the missing girl. </p>



<p>Portuguese cops are waiting for results from the VW van that Christian B drove while living on the Algarve where the three-year-old vanished&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2238940/madeleine-mccann-investigation-latest-theories/">on May 3, 2007</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">The German convicted paedophile</a>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/">questioned by police in Oldenburg jail</a>&nbsp;after authorities named him as an official suspect on Thursday.</p>



<p>Police asked him: &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18348973/mccann-suspect-van-tested-cops/">Where were you the night Madeleine McCann disappeared?</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Christian B was pressed to provide an alibi, adding: &#8220;If you weren’t by the apartment she ­disappeared from, where were you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Insiders close to the case claim he did not answer any of the questions.</p>



<p>It comes after cops in Portugal decided they WILL continue to investigate Madeleine McCann&#8217;s disappearance despite the Met Police ending its probe.</p>



<p>Sources close to Portuguese authorities said abandoning their ongoing case review was &#8220;completely out of the question&#8221;. </p>



<p>Portugal&#8217;s Attorney General’s Office said an independent inquiry led by prosecutors out of the Algarve will continue.</p>

<p>THIS is the extraordinary moment Ukraine blitzed TWO Russian Navy boats in a deadly drone attack &#8211; sending Putin&#8217;s butchers sinking to a watery grave.</p>



<p>Astonishing footage shows what is understood to be Turkish made <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17957095/ukraine-russia-turkey-drone-bayraktar-tb2/">Bayraktar TB2</a> drones unleashing hell on two fast-attack boats in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The infrared video &#8211; released by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukrainian armed forces</a> &#8211; shows one of the Raptor-class craft floating off the coast of the war ravaged country.</p>



<p>But moments later, it is pounded in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">direct strike from the sky</a>, sending an enormous fireball into the air as it&#8217;s blown to smithereens </p>



<p>While another clip appears to show a boat accelerating shortly before it&#8217;s annihilated in a direct strike &#8211; obliterating the entire vessel in a hellish inferno.</p>



<p>The attacks will be a blow to Mad Vlad given <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> are believed to have only seven Raptor&#8217;s operating in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Raptors can carry up to 20 marines and are armed with 14.5mm and 7.62mm machineguns.</p>



<p>They can travel up to 48 knots (55mph) and are some of the fastest boats in the Russian navy.</p>



<p>Both attacks took place near famous Snake Island where a group of heroic Ukrainian Border guards told the now destroyed Moskva to &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17766686/snake-island-massacre-last-words-ukrainian-soldiers-slaughtered-russia/">go f*** yourself</a>” after it ordered them to surrender. </p>



<p>Russia&nbsp;later captured the island but<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/"> Moskva was sunk by two Neptune anti-ship missiles</a> on April 14 in one of the biggest moments of the war so far.</p>

<p>Following the release of footage, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine’s</a> armed forces, celebrated the sinking&#8217;s.</p>



<p>He wrote on on Facebook: “Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at daybreak today near Snake Island.</p>



<p>“Bayraktar is working.”</p>



<h2 id="death-from-above">DEATH FROM ABOVE</h2>



<p>The unmanned Bayraktar TB2 has caused mayhem for Russia&#8217;s invading forces since the war began &#8211; with footage emerging of the drones destroying Russian missile launchers.</p>



<p>The Turkish death machines can hang menacingly in the air for an astonishing 27-HOURS at an altitude of 25,000 feet.</p>



<p>They are equipped with four laser guided smart ammunition rockets and can dart through the air at 137mph thanks to a 110-horsepower engine.</p>



<p>Bayraktar TB2&#8217;s have become so popular and successful since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine that a song dedicated to the £3.8million drones has been released.</p>



<p>Despite all this, the machines are basic compared to other tech being deployed in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Discussing Bayraktar&#8217;s, drone expert David Hambling told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/are-ukraines-cheap-slow-drones-successful-russian-targets-rcna19982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a>: &#8220;It is literally a World War I aircraft, in terms of performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Footage of drone strikes on Russian units have been widely shared since the war began on February 24.</p>



<p>One dramatic clip shows the moment a bomb from a Ukrainian drone <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18434767/moment-bomb-ukrainian-drone-sunroof-russian-soldiers-vehicle/">flies through the SUNROOF</a> of a Russian vehicle sending soldiers running for their lives.</p>



<p>While another <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18282697/bomb-dropped-ukrainian-drone-destroys-russian-tank/">extraordinary clip shows the moment</a> a Russian tank was blown to smithereens in a lethal night-time raid by a Ukrainian drone attack.</p>



<p>The drone is understood to be worth only &nbsp;$10,000 a-piece.</p>



<p>Aerorozvidka &#8211; an amateur volunteer unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces who specialise in drone warfare &#8211; are behind most of the drone attacks in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson will say: “When my country faced the threat of invasion during the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/">Second World War</a>, our Parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict.</p>



<p>“And the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour.</p>

<p>“This is Ukraine’s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come.</p>



<p>“Your children and grandchildren will say that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainians</a> taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.”</p>



<p>The famous Finest Hour speech by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/winston-churchill/">Churchill</a> was made just after the fall of France in 1940.</p>



<p>In March, Mr Zelensky received thunderous applause from MPs as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/17885678/zelenskyy-makes-historic-address-to-mps/">he addressed Parliament by video</a> and channelled Churchill’s “We will fight them on the beaches” speech.</p>

<p>Speaking from his Kyiv bunker, he vowed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> invaders would be defeated “on the sea and in the air”. He pledged: “We will fight for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.”</p>



<p>New British aid for Ukraine will also include long-range Brimstone missiles and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer air defence vehicles</a>, along with heavy lift aerial drones to provide logistical support to isolated units.</p>



<p>However, an investigation is reportedly under way into how UK-made components came to be used in weapons deployed by Russia.</p>



<p>The Royal United Services Institute said an abandoned Borisoglebsk-2 mobile jamming system was found to contain components made in the UK, US, Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the first civilians to flee the “Alamo” Azovstal steel plant in blitzed Mariupol were due to reach the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia last night.</p>



<p>Around 100 people — mostly women and children — <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433015/ukraine-war-mariupul-steel-factory-civilians/">escaped the sprawling steel plant</a> in a major humanitarian breakthrough on Sunday.</p>



<p>More were due to follow after Mr Zelensky signalled the UN and Red Cross-backed mission would resume at 8am yesterday.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba confirmed it was “under way” but declined to say how many people were involved.</p>



<p>He warned: “Everything is very fragile. Things can fall apart at any given moment so it’s better to wait until the evacuation is over.”</p>



<p>Around 2,000 troops and 500 civilians were trapped in tunnels and bunkers where soldiers have made a desperate last stand in the final part of the city still under Ukrainian control.</p>



<p>Yesterday, European football chiefs confirmed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/18439498/russia-champions-league-celtic-rangers/">Russian teams would be excluded</a> from next season’s Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.</p>



<p>Uefa also banned Russia from the Women’s European Championship in England in July and from participating in qualifying for next year’s women’s World Cup.</p>



<p>Russia’s bids to host the men’s Euros in 2028 and 2032 were also thrown out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EU politicians remain split over how the Bloc can wean itself off Russian energy supplies.</p>



<p>Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck said his country is not ready to block gas but could cope with an oil ban by the end of the year. Hungary is opposed to banning both Russian oil and gas.</p>

<p>A CAT that survived four WEEKS stranded in a shelled block of flats in Ukraine has finally been rescued by big-hearted animal lovers.</p>



<p>The feline &#8211; which miraculously survived a rocket strike from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin&#8217;s</a> butchers &#8211; was saved from the seventh floor in a suburb of Kyiv after a mammoth social media campaign.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18440531" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 832px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fdb5ed11-4644-4420-8f9f-c56ec0257851-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=822" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440531" width="822" height="653" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The cat was stranded on the seventh floor of the devastated apartment block for four WEEKS</figcaption><figcredit>Cover Images</figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_18440437" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/26e40400-ae17-4bed-9e04-18c3f87fedbf.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440437" width="960" height="947" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The rescue team used a fire engine&#8217;s ladder to get the cat down</figcaption><figcredit>Cover Images</figcredit></figure>



<p>Astonishing pictures show how a hero rescue team in war ravaged Borodyanka scrambled to save the fearless creature from the terrifying height, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10775377/OMG-Ukraine-thank-saving-kitty-Incredible-mission-save-lone-cat-survived-bombing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a> reported.</p>



<p>A team led by local hero Eugene Kibets &#8211; who had responded to desperate calls online to save the cat &#8211; used a fire engine with a crane to reach the stranded animal high up in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18440038/shocking-footage-russian-missile/">charred building</a>.</p>



<p>A brave emergency services worker then climbed the vertigo educing crane to grab the cat, which can be seen peaking over the edge of a blown out apartment. </p>



<p>The kitty &#8211; which is likely to have used up at least one of its nine lives throughout the saga &#8211; is now being treated at a local animal clinic, where she was started eating again.</p>

<p>Prior to the rescue, Mr Kibets knew the scale of the challenge ahead, writing: &#8220;The cat is on the 7th floor of a non-existent house.&#8221;</p>



<p>But when he and his team finally accomplished the daring effort, he posed with the cat in his arms and simply wrote: &#8220;I’m so happy!!!!!!!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cat fan Lorenzo the Cat wrote on Twitter: &#8220;Holy S*** he did it! Eugene Kibets got the cat from the 7th floor of a bombed building.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know this is crazy, but amid the horror of war we have to celebrate the good in humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE parents of Madeleine McCann have told of their “need for answers” as they remember her on the poignant 15th anniversary of her disappearance tomorrow &#8211; which they say is &#8220;a very long time&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry said tonight: &#8220;This year we mark fifteen years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It’s a very long time.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18440006" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000634909506.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440006" width="960" height="676" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>Gerry and Kate McCann say they &#8216;need answers&#8217;[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18440007" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000727967220-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440007" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>PA</figcredit></figure>Their daughter Maddie vanished 15 years ago[/caption]



<p>The brave couple, who are due to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433337/madeleine-mccann-parents-prayer-service/">join well wishers in their home village to pray for their daughter</a>, told how they found the phrase needing “closure” a difficult term.</p>



<p>In a heartfelt posting on the eve of the milestone anniversary on the Find Maddie and Official Campaign websites, the McCanns wrote: &#8220;Many people talk about the need for ‘closure’. It’s always felt a strange term</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of outcome, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">Madeleine</a> will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is true though that uncertainty creates weakness; knowledge and certainty give strength, and for this reason our need for answers, for the truth, is essential.”</p>

<p>Heart doctor Gerry, 53, and hospital medical worker Kate, 54, from Rothley, Leicestershire, also raised three nations&#8217; police forces for their continued work in trying to crack the painstaking case.</p>



<p>Three-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18338001/christian-b-will-stand-trial-over-madeleine-mccanns-disappearance/">Maddie</a> vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May 2007 while her parents were dining with pals nearby.</p>



<p>They cling onto a glimmer of hope she could still be alive. She would now be aged 18, nearly 19.</p>



<p>In their anniversary posting they said: &#8220;As always, we would like to thank all of our supporters for their continued good wishes and support.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a huge comfort to know that regardless of time passed, Madeleine is still in people’s hearts and minds.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their post is accompanied by a touching phrase from Winnie the Pooh author AA Milne, with a picture of Pooh bear and Piglet, saying: “But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart, I’ll always be with you.”</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry are expected to join family, friends and supporters for an informal evening service tomorrow &#8211; as a German rapist made an official suspect over Madde’s abduction faces being charged.</p>



<p>It will be the first time in four years that Kate and Gerry are together set to attend an annual outdoor prayer gathering in their village for Maddie, who they hope is “still alive.&#8221;</p>



<p>A family source said: &#8220;Kate and Gerry are expected to go to the service. It will be a time of reflection.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the past two years special prayers for Maddie at the village war memorial, where a candle still burns around the clock for her, have not been held because of the coronavirus lockdown restricting gatherings.</p>



<p>In 2019 Kate attended the public event without her husband as he was away working in Italy, but was accompanied by her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8663944/madeleine-mccann-brother-sister/">twins Sean and Amelie</a> &#8211; who are now aged 17.</p>



<h2 id="glimmer-of-hope">&#8216;GLIMMER OF HOPE&#8217;</h2>



<p>Maddie’s great uncle, retired head teacher Brian Kennedy, 83, told The Sun: “We decided just a day before the recent news about Madeleine to hold a gathering again on Cross Green.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have no more knowledge of the recent situation re the Madeleine suspect than the reports in the Press. Doubtless all will become clearer in time. We intend to have the gathering anyway.”</p>



<p>The McCanns have welcomed news that caged <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18338001/christian-b-will-stand-trial-over-madeleine-mccanns-disappearance/">Christian B has been made an “arguido&#8221;</a> &#8211; an official suspect.</p>



<p>Two years ago, the sex fiend was sensationally named by German officers as the person “responsible” for Maddie’s kidnap and presumed murder.</p>



<p>He was quizzed for the first time last week at Oldenburg jail, where he is serving a sentence for raping an American tourist &#8211; but is understood to have used his right to remain silent.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">Christian B</a>, who has been linked to four other child murders across Europe since 1996, could now be summoned to Portugal for questioning <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433235/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-charged-months/">and even be charged.</a></p>



<p>A McCann source added: “All Kate and Gerry want is to know what happened to their daughter, and whether she is alive or dead, and for her abductor to be found and brought to justice.</p>

<p>“With no evidence, so far, that Madeleine has died they hold onto a glimmer of hope she could still be alive and out there waiting to be found.</p>



<p>“The prime suspect being made arguido is welcomed by the family and a step forward. But they can&#8217;t be too hopeful because the person has still not been arrested and questioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>A PENSIONER who nursing home staff thought had died turned out to be ALIVE just as his body was about to be taken to a crematorium.</p>



<p>Bizarre footage has emerged on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china">Chinese</a> social media showing the moment baffled workers unzipped a body bag after staff noticed movement as it was put in a hearse.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438882" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 625px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730183531.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=615" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438882" width="615" height="774" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Douyin/FM10271027</figcredit></figure>Footage shows two workers pulling a body bag from a hearse[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18439024" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 258px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/d3014c9d-b5c1-4094-b045-c5c5c34b3891.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=248" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18439024" width="248" height="204" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A man who nursing home staff thought was dead was discovered alive, it&#8217;s reported</figcaption><figcredit>Douyin/FM10271027</figcredit></figure>



<p>Putuo District has launched an investigation as according to video posted locally in Shanghai &#8211; which has been subject to the world&#8217;s strictest Covid lockdown &#8211; the man was found alive after being put in a body bag.</p>



<p>The clip shows officials in protective gear hauling a yellow body bag from the hearse.</p>



<p>They can be heard telling staff to open it and one person says: &#8220;You come here and see if he&#8217;s dead? He is still breathing! Didn&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s moving?&#8221;</p>



<p>The unverified footage from May 1 then shows the body bag being peeled back &#8211; revealing the pensioner is indeed still alive despite carers thinking he&#8217;d died from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid.</a></p>

<p>A person then tells staff: &#8220;He is alive, don&#8217;t cover his face ever again.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man was then wheeled back into the nursing home before being taken to hospital for a check-up.</p>



<p>He is understood to be in a stable condition as authorities probe the incident after the nursing home issued an apology.</p>



<p>It comes after Shanghai&#8217;s 26 million residents were plunged into an extremely strict lockdown for more than five weeks with Chinese authorities justifying it as a way to get the city&#8217;s Covid cases under control.</p>

<p>FRESH details about Vladimir Putin’s reported secret sons have shone a light into the tangled family life of the Russian tyrant.</p>



<p>Putin, who is said to be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18402141/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-paranoia-traitors-insane/">suffering from dementia</a>, reportedly <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18429651/vladimir-putin-two-sons-secret-gymnast-lover/">shares the two sons with his secret gymnast lover</a>, according to a doctor present at the birth. </p>

<p>Putin&#8217;s personal life has predominantly been characterised by several relationships and several children &#8211; some acknowledged, others not.</p>

<p>She was first romantically linked with Putin a decade ago.</p>



<p>The Kremlin has denied she is his secret First Lady but rumours have persisted including claims she gave birth to at least one child.</p>



<p>One popular Russian newspaper called her the &#8220;First Lady, but in the shadows&#8221;.</p>



<p>In September 2017 she was pictured with what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4389952/vladimir-putin-rumoured-girlfriend-alina-kabaeva-wedding-ring-rumours-picture/">looked like a wedding ring during an event in Italy.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 id="the-secret-kids">THE ‘SECRET’ KIDS</h2>



<p>Putin and Kabeva are thought to have had secret children together, although there has never been any official confirmation of either their relationship or their kids.</p>



<p>Kabaeva, 38, is said to be &#8220;holed up in a very private and very secure chalet in Switzerland,&#8221; a source told&nbsp;<a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/03/06/vladimir-putin-hiding-alina-kabaeva-kids-in-switzerland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alina has two young boys and twin girls with Putin who were born in Switzerland,&#8221; the source added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The kids all have Swiss passports, and I imagine she does also.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kabaeva has been linked to the Russian leader for more than 13 years, and&nbsp;in May it was alleged that she had had two sons by him &#8211; one born in Switzerland in 2015 amid huge security and the other in 2019 in Russia.</p>



<p>Kabaeva had also&nbsp;travelled multiple times to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/switzerland/">Switzerland</a> before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438087" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000728533749.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438087" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Putin with Alina Kabaeva in 2019[/caption]



<p>As war sanctions were imposed this year, rumours suggested that she and her children were hiding out the war at a Swiss chalet retreat.</p>



<p>But in April &#8211; after a four-month absence from the limelight &#8211; she reappeared in Moscow sporting pro war attire.</p>



<h2 id="the-ex-wife">THE EX-WIFE</h2>



<p>The Russian President and former KGB officer, 69, was married to Lyudmila Shkrebneva for over 30 years, until their divorce in 2014.</p>



<p>He met the former Aeroflot flight attendant in Leningrad &#8211; now Saint Petersburg &#8211; and married her in July 1983.</p>



<p>Lyudmila is a linguist and from 1990-94 taught languages at Leningrad State University, before her husband&#8217;s political career took off in local government in St Petersburg.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> became president in 2000, Lyudmila served as the First Lady of Russia but preferred to stay out of the limelight.</p>



<p>In June 2013 the couple announced they were to separate and the end of their marriage was confirmed in April the following year.</p>



<h2 id="the-mistress-and-the-teen-queen">THE MISTRESS AND THE TEEN QUEEN</h2>



<p>Another of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13325644/putin-love-child-social-media/">Elizaveta Krivonogikh</a>&nbsp;in November 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13302399/vladimir-putin-secret-love-child-cleaner-erotic-shows/">Elizaveta was named</a>&nbsp;as Putin’s secret daughter by investigative media outlet Proekt backed by a visual computing expert at a British university.</p>



<p>Her mother Svetlana Krivonogikh, 45, is alleged to have had an affair with the strongman leader when he was head of the FSB counterintelligence service, prime minister and during his first term as Russian president.</p>



<p>The mistress is claimed to be a cleaner-turned-millionaire who owns a nightspot featuring &#8220;erotic shows”.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438081" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 646px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000650496989.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=636" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438081" width="636" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>Elizaveta Krivonogikh is said to be a &#8216;secret love child&#8217; of Putin[/caption]



<p>In April, it was reported that she and her daughter had been living in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18212856/inside-putins-daughters-gaudy-gold-plated-penthouse/">&#8220;palace&#8221; like £1.7 million home</a> in St Petersburg as it was revealed they were renting out another luxurious gold plated home in the city.</p>



<p>It came a year after Elizaveta was reportedly seen for the first time being driven by an official government car to a packed venue in the Moscow as she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14263250/vladimir-putins-secret-love-child-birthday-dj-moscow/">celebrated her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday party.</a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>She has refused to confirm findings by Bradford University visual computer expert Hassan Ugail that she shows a “phenomenal resemblance to the Russian president”.</p>



<h2 id="two-daughters">TWO DAUGHTERS</h2>



<p>Despite the split, Putin shares two daughters, Maria and Katerina, from his marriage to Lyudmila and they are his only confirmed children.</p>



<p>Maria is said to be an endocrinologist and has a career in medical research.</p>



<p>She is believed to be married to a Dutch businessman, Jorrit Faassen, with whom she has a family, making Putin a grandfather.</p>



<p>Katerina, 33, meanwhile, has gone from being a high-kicking &#8220;rock’n’roll&#8221; dancer to spearheading a major new Russian artificial intelligence initiative.</p>



<p>She was formerly married to Russia’s youngest billionaire, Kirill Shamalov, 38, though is now divorced.</p>



<p>She gained a doctorate from Moscow State University after completing a study on helping cosmonauts and pilots to orientate themselves in difficult conditions.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438072" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000552624294.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438072" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin&#8217;s daughter Maria Putina</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>In June 2020, unseen pictures of the two as daughters as teenagers hemerged from the private collection of an estranged friend.</p>



<p>They were released as part of a $15milllion legal case brought against the Russian state by former Putin confident Sergei Pugachev, 57.</p>



<p>Speaking of his daughters in 2015 Putin said: &#8220;My daughters live in Russia and studied only in Russia, I am proud of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They speak three foreign languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Every person has a right for their fate, they live their own life and do it with dignity,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>MADELEINE McCann suspect Christian B claims a woman he was having sex with at the time of the toddler&#8217;s disappearance will provide him with an alibi.</p>



<p>The shocking claim comes amid reports he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433235/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-charged-months/">could be charged within months</a>, in light of &#8220;extremely strong&#8221; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">new evidence</a> in Maddie&#8217;s case.</p>

<p>German cops previously said the convicted <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">sex offender</a>, 45, who was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">declared an “arguido”</a> by Portuguese police, has not <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383657/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-alibi-german-cops/">provided them with an alibi</a>. </p>



<p>The rapist who has told a US documentary he was elsewhere when the tot was snatched <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">in Algarve in 2007</a>, has now claimed he was with having sex with a German woman in his camper van that night, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-claims-he-has-an-alibi-which-can-be-backed-by-woman-12604001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky </a>reports.</p>



<p>He said the pair were even stopped and photographed at a police roadblock, as he drove her to the airport in Faro, the next day.</p>



<p>He also claimed the woman was arrested at airport security for carrying an illegal pepper spray and later appeared in court. </p>

<p>He reckons Portuguese police must have a record of the incident which will prove his relationship with the German woman, who was on holiday with her parents.</p>



<p>German cops reportedly found a photo of the woman lying in the suspect&#8217;s van during the investigation into the rape of a US pensioner, in Portugal in  2005, for which Christian B is currently serving a seven-year jail sentence. </p>



<p>While at first he reportedly could not remember the woman&#8217;s full name, it is understood he had been able to identify her. </p>



<p>If confirmed, the alibi would contradict evidence from mobile phone data that put him 200 yards from Kate and Gerry’s Ocean Club apartment on the day Madeleine was taken.</p>

<p>German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, told Sky News: &#8220;I assume if he has anything that exonerates him that sooner or later he will share it with us and we would then check it out. What happens then, let&#8217;s see.</p>



<p>&#8220;So far he has told us nothing, he&#8217;s given us no alibi. So, we can only work on the evidence we have found so far in our investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;And there was nothing to exonerate him.&#8221;</p>



<p>After two years of complete silence, Christina B has claimed he<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/"> can prove where he was </a>at the time Maddie got abducted.</p>



<p>The details will be revealed tomorrow, on the 15th anniversary of the young Brit&#8217;s disappearance,  in the documentary Madeleine McCann: <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18335904/suspect-charged-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-germany/">Prime Suspect</a>, by US network AMC Crime.</p>



<p>Despite investigators&#8217; suspicions of his links to the unsolved case, he has never been charged.</p>



<p>It has previously been claimed that the suspect has a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17433138/madeleine-mccann-suspect-alibi/"> “number of people”</a> willing to provide an alibi.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters said: “We actually haven&#8217;t found a single piece of the puzzle in the two years that would have somehow helped to exonerate Christian B. </p>



<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s really nothing that would somehow maybe be an alibi or something. Nothing of that has come to light, really at any point.&#8221;</p>

<p>He added: “However, it is not foreseeable when we will come to an end. So I can&#8217;t say that we will definitely conclude the investigations this year. That really also depends on how this develops.”</p>

<h2>What happened to Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span>?</h2>
<p>Schumacher suffered a horrific ski crash while with his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/14444163/f1-legend-michael-schumacher-son-mick-msc/">son Mick</a>, who was 14 at the time, on the slopes above Méribel in the French Alps on December 29, 2013.</p>
<p>He fell and hit his head on a rock while crossing an off-piste area &#8211; suffering a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet.</p>
<p>Doctors said he would most likely have died had he not been wearing the safety gear, and the world champ was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital.</p>
<p>Schumacher immediately underwent two surgeries.</p>

<p>He was put into a medically induced coma after suffering what was described as a &#8220;traumatic brain injury&#8221;.</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> driver was brought <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16298336/michael-schumacher-coma/">out of the coma</a> by June 2014 and was released to go and rehabilitate at his home in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/switzerland/">Switzerland</a>.</p>
<p>Since then information on his treatment and his condition has been patchy despite the intense interest from fans and the press.</p>
<p>His tragic ski accident came just over a year after he retired from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/f1/">F1</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>He had mounted a brief comeback for three seasons with the new Mercedes team after initially hanging up his helmet in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2021, his family broke their eight-year silence on the seven-time world champion&#8217;s condition in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16081540/michael-schumacher-wife-different-strong-netflix/">Netflix documentary examining his illustrious career.</a></p>
<h2>Where is Michael Schumacher now?</h2>
<p>Schumacher was skiing off piste in an area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit in France when he fell and hit his head on a rock.</p>
<p>Even though he was wearing a helmet he suffered a horrendous head injury.</p>
<p>He was airlifted to hospital and put into a medically induced coma.</p>
<p>Doctors performed two operations on him to remove blood from his brain and relieve the pressure.</p>
<p>After being in hospital for a year he was taken back to his home in Lake Geneva in 2014 where it&#8217;s believed he has remained ever since while undergoing further rehabilitation.</p>
<p>His wife Corinna explained in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/15734438/michael-schumacher-netflix-documentary-release-date/">Netflix interview</a>: &#8220;We&#8217;re together. We live together at home. We do therapy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he&#8217;s comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to make him feel our family, our bond, And no matter, I will do everything I can. We all will.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How is Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span> doing now?</h2>
<p>Information about Schumacher&#8217;s ongoing health and condition remains closely guarded by his family and manager, but Schumacher, released in September 2021, delved deeper than ever before into the life of the racing legend.</p>
<p>It features interviews with members of Michael&#8217;s close family, including his father Rolf and brother Ralf, as well as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/6248647/michael-schumacher-wife-corinna-f1-children-mick-gina-maria/">Corinna</a> and their two children, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6245047/michael-schumacher-daughter-gina-maria-condition/">Gina</a> and Mick.</p>
<p>It also includes conversations with racing royalty such as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12163766/michael-schumachers-ferrari-boss-jean-todt/#:~:text=Jean%20Todt%20was%20the%20seven,to%202004%2C%20under%20his%20leadership.">Jean Todt</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bernie-ecclestone/">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/sebastian-vettel/#:~:text=Sebastian%20Vettel%20is%20a%20German,the%20youngest%20champion%20in%202010.">Sebastian Vettel</a>, Mika Häkkinen, Damon Hill, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10328045/flavio-briatore-girlfriend-heidi-klum-naomi-campbell/">Flavio Briatore</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/3922470/david-coulthard-net-worth-f1-formula-one/">David Coulthard</a>.</p>
<p><strong>December 2013</strong>  &#8211; After his crash, Schumacher is rushed to Grenoble Hospital where he undergoes two surgeries and is placed into a coma.</p>
<p>Professor Jean-Francois Payen describes his condition as &#8220;extremely serious&#8221; and says the F1 champ underwent a brain scan.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in a critical condition and his condition is said to be extremely serious. He is in intensive care,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>April 2014</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s manager Sabine Kehm tells the press that the racer is showing &#8220;moments of consciousness&#8221; as he emerged from his coma.</p>
<p>She added he was making &#8220;progress&#8221; &#8211; but noted Schumacher was facing a &#8220;long difficult fight&#8221; on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Kehm also insisted the family did not intend to give a running commentary on his condition.</p>
<p><strong>June 2014 </strong>&#8211; Schumacher is reported to have regained consciousness fully and is transferred to the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>September 2014</strong> &#8211; Schumacher leaves the Swiss hospital and returns to his family home in Gland on the shores of Lake Geneva to continue his recovery.</p>
<p>His manager Kehm again insists that he has made &#8220;progress&#8221; but a &#8220;long and difficult road&#8221; remains ahead for the F1 star.</p>
<p><strong>November 2014</strong> &#8211; Former racing driver Philippe Streiff, a friend of Schumacher, claims the seven-time champion cannot speak, is paralysed, and is using a wheelchair.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is getting better but everything is relative. It’s very difficult,&#8221; the former F1 driver told French radio.</p>
<p><strong>May 2015</strong> &#8211; Kehm delivers a video message in the first official update on his condition for months as part of a launch event for a watch that Schumacher helped design.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are happy to say still he does improvement and I say this always considering the severeness of the injury he had,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;But of course it will take a very long time for everybody involved to fight, and we are happy to take this <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/16661846/michael-schumacher-fighting-eight-years-crash/">fight</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>February 2016</strong> &#8211; Cryptic comments by Schumacher&#8217;s former Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo spark further speculation about the driver&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have news and unfortunately it is not good,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Life is strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a fantastic driver and only had one accident with Ferrari in 1999.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schumacher&#8217;s team decline to comment on his remarks.</p>
<p><strong>September 2016</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s lawyer Felix Damm tells a German court that his client &#8220;cannot walk&#8221; as part of a lawsuit against magazine Die Bunte.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Michael cannot even stand with the help of his special therapists.</p>
<p>I cannot make any other comments about Michael&#8217;s health situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Die Bunte had claimed Schumacher was able to take steps and raise an arm months previously, which was rebutted by Kehm.</p>
<p><strong>August 2018</strong> &#8211; French magazine Paris March reported that &#8220;close relatives&#8221; told them the F1 champ remains in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>It was claimed that Schumacher cries when he is rolled to look at the panoramic landscapes around his home.</p>
<p>Previous reports had also claimed the racer cried when he heard his children&#8217;s voices, or saw his wife Corinna.</p>
<p><strong>July 2019</strong> &#8211; F1 boss <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16055830/michael-schumacher-health-update-french-alps-crash/">Jean Todt</a> offers one of the most detailed health updates in years which speaking to Radio Monte-Carlo.</p>
<p>He reveals he visits Schumacher and the duo have even watched F1 races together on television.</p>
<p>The former Ferrari boss insists that he is making &#8220;good progress&#8221; &#8211; but adds he has to be &#8220;careful&#8221; with his statements.</p>
<p><b>February</b><strong> 2019 &#8211; </strong>Schumacher is reported to have spent the winter at his family&#8217;s luxury <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8524111/michael-schumacher-luxury-majorca-villa-carers/">£26million Majorca villa</a> with round-the-clock carers.</p>
<p>Neighbours told Bunte they saw the German racing legend arrive by dark blue helicopter at Port d’Andratx on the Spanish island.</p>
<p>The family purchased the property in 2018 &#8211; and it reportedly has two swimming pools, a large manicured garden, helipad and stunning sea views.</p>
<p><strong>September 2019</strong> &#8211; Le Parisien reports Schumacher has been admitted to the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris to undergo <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16125964/michael-schumacher-pioneering-stem-cell-therapy/">stem cell treatment</a>.</p>
<p>It is claimed he was under the care of pioneering surgeon Philippe Menasché.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7447481/Pictured-Ambulance-took-Michael-Schumacher-Paris-hospital.html">Pictures emerge allegedly showing a private ambulance</a> that had brought Schumacher to the hospital, and medical staff were quoted as saying he was &#8220;conscious&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>June 2020</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s son Mick releases an open letter about his father as he looked destined to follow him into F1 as he impressed while racing in F2.</p>
<p>While not giving any updates on his health, Mick wrote: &#8220;He is always my father in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I don&#8217;t take the lessons he passed on to me as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these lessons is to remain constant, never to be too euphoric or too depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>June 2020 </strong>&#8211; Schumacher is reported to have had further stem cell treatments delayed due to the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>It is also claimed the F1 driver was suffering muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, a bone wasting disease, from being confined to bed for six years.</p>
<p>Dr Nicola Acciari said: &#8220;The goal is to regenerate Michael’s nervous system.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>November 2020</strong> &#8211; F1 boss Todt again speaks out on Schumacher and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12644800/michael-schumacher-fighting-jean-todt-reveals-secret-visit-last-week/">says he visits him regularly</a>, during which the two watch TV together.</p>
<p>&#8220;His fight continues, along with his family and doctors,” Todt told De Telegraaf newspaper.</p>
<p>However, he declines to comment when asked if Schumacher is aware of his son&#8217;s success &#8211; with the younger racer winning the 2020 F2 title and earning a seat in F1 with Haas.</p>
<p><strong>April 2021</strong> &#8211; Michael&#8217;s wife Corrina <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14673054/michael-schumacher-wife-selling-lake-geneva-home/">reportedly puts their Lake Geneva home up for sale for £5million.</a></p>
<p>Bodyguards and domestic workers were staying at the home until recently with some horses having grazed the pastures only a few months ago.</p>
<p>The couple had bought the &#8220;Sur le Moulin&#8221; estate in 2002 when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-schumacher/">Michael</a> was about to win his fifth F1 world title in 2002 for £3million.</p>
<p><strong>August 2021 &#8211; </strong>F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone makes a promising comment that Michael could one day answer questions himself.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;He is not with us at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when he gets better, he’ll answer all the questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>September 2021 &#8211;</strong> Ahead of the release of Schumacher, it was revealed that Michael had raised concerns about the snow conditions in the Alps before his tragic accident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/7671033/michael-schumacher-wife-different-strong-netflix/">Breaking her solemn eight-year silence, his wife Corrina explained</a>: &#8220;Shortly before it happened in Meribel, he said to me, &#8216;The snow isn&#8217;t optimal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could fly to Dubai and go skydiving there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said as he had &#8220;always made it through his races safely&#8221; she was &#8220;certain he had a few guardian angels that were keeping an eye out for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/15960917/michael-schumacher-netflix-documentary-wife-f1/">53-year-old said</a> of his condition: &#8220;&#8216;Everybody misses Michael, but Michael is here &#8211; different, but here. He still shows me how strong he is every day.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>November, 2021</strong> &#8211; Motor racing executive and family friend Jean Todt offered an update on his friend in an interview with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-10173269/Jean-Todt-gives-insight-Michael-Schumacher-eight-years-Germans-horror-skiing-accident.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Daily Mail,</a> having visited him the month before.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I can understand why his family and friends are protecting him because we should leave him in peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael is fighting, he is fighting, and we can only hope that he will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy that his son Mick is in Formula One.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is doing well.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could have a more competitive car but I am pleased he has this passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy that Gina-Maria (Michael&#8217;s daughter) has found her passion in horses.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>January 2022 &#8211; </strong>Michael&#8217;s son Mick marked his dad&#8217;s 53rd birthday by paying tribute in an emotional social media post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy birthday, dad. Days like these were important to my growing passion for motorsport, and still affects it to this day,&#8221; he wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for all the experiences you have given me and I’m excited to be making new ones in the future.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What has Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span>&#8216;s family said?</h2>
<p>Schumacher&#8217;s family &#8211; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10620686/michael-schumacher-wife-small-steps-anniversary-accident/">his wife Corinna</a> and their children <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/14232554/mick-schumacher-proud-dad-michael-f1-debut/">Mick</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6245047/michael-schumacher-daughter-gina-maria-condition/">Gina-Maria</a> &#8211; have fiercely defended their privacy amid the intense interest over his health.</p>
<p>The family all live together at home to care for him and &#8220;do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he&#8217;s comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corinna explained in the Schumacher documentary: &#8220;It&#8217;s very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us, now we are protecting Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>On August 9, 2018, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6980069/michael-schumacher-son-mick-wins-first-race/">Mick</a> shared memories of his dad after snapping up his first victory in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7487690/mick-schumacher-michael-schumacher-f3-f1-motorsport/">European Formula 3</a> at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium – his dad’s favourite track.</p>
<p>Speaking about his victory with Mobil 1 The Grid, the young racer said the track brought him many happy memories as it was often labelled “the living room of my dad”.</p>
<p>In the Netflix documentary, Corinna said she has never blamed God for her husband&#8217;s battle, saying it was &#8220;just really bad luck &#8211; all the bad luck anyone could ever have in their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mick has faced questions about his dad during his rise up the motorsport pyramid. He won the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/13398735/mick-schumacher-f2-world-championship-michael-f1/">F2 title in 2020</a> and debuted in F1 in 2021.</p>
<p>Speaking before his first race with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/14733165/mick-schumacher-f1-debut/">Haas in Bahrain</a>, Mick told ESPN: &#8220;I had the best teacher and I&#8217;m happy to have made it all the way now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>After following his father&#8217;s footsteps, in the new documentary, the 23-year-old touchingly told how he would &#8220;give up everything&#8221; to chat with his dad about their shared motorsport success.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: &#8220;Since the accident, of course, these experiences, these moments that I believe many people have with their parents, are no longer present or to a lesser extent.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;And in my view, that is a little unfair.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;I think me and dad, we would understand each other in a different way now.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;Simply because we speak a similar language – the language of motor sport – and that we would have a lot more to talk about.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;And that is where my head is most of the time. Thinking that would be so cool … I would give up everything just for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/mick-schumacher-interview-michael-haas-2022-b2033727.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Independent</a> in March 2022, Mick addressed the perceived burden of being Michael&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>He said: “I don’t feel that pressure because I don’t pay attention to it, I just blend it out.</p>
<p>“I can create my own legacy while still looking back at what my dad did.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s nice for me to be able to remind people of what my dad did and at the same time show what can I do.”</p>

<p>A MAN has sued his friends who cut him out after they won £600,000 on the lottery.</p>



<p>Philip Tsotsos from Windsor, Ontario, Canada has been left out of the massive prize that was won by the group of sixteen pals last summer.</p>

<p>The group of sixteen pals won the Maxmillion prize on a Lotto Max ticket from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) last year <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/lottery-group-left-out-1.6433692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBC</a> reported.</p>



<p>They claim that Tsotsos is not entitled to a part of the prize as he had not paid the amount required to stay in the lottery pool.</p>



<p>But now &#8220;hurt&#8221; pizza delivery worker Tsotsos has taken the matter to the civil court as he claims he should be declared the 17th winner.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Their dreams came true. Why should they steal mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>He is suing the group of friends for £40,000 and other costs, including interest.</p>



<p>Tsotsos added he discovered the group had won on social media.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t they tell me they won? These guys are like family to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The group&#8217;s defence lawyer David Robins said: &#8220;Mr Tsotsos did not pay to play, so we deny that he is entitled to any of the relief that he is seeking, and we&#8217;ll be vigorously defending the claim.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this instance, he did not play and he was not included.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Mr Tsotsos insists he didn&#8217;t always pay for the tickets right away as the pool operated on a credit system.</p>



<p>He said he always ensured to pay his debts in the past and he&#8217;s never been cut off in the six years he&#8217;s taken part in the pool.</p>



<p>Tsotsos had reportedly a tab of £18 at the time of the draw, when the group&#8217;s organiser Steven Todesco messaged him he would have to repay the amount plus another £6 to remain in the group.</p>



<p>Tsotsos reportedly replied he would pay the amount (£25) that Friday  and then said &#8220;just take it out of our winnings when we win.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response, the organiser joked he would charge him a high-interest rate.</p>



<p>According to reports Tsotsos received another reminder from a different member of the group to make sure he would pay the £6 to stay in to which he agreed that he would.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ok, just wanted it in writing before the draw lol,&#8221; was the purported response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tsotsos said the day he found out about the win he had just brought the group a free pizza.</p>



<p>He said &#8220;the same guy that&#8217;s eating my pizza is holding a million-dollar cheque,&nbsp;and that&#8217;s how I found out,&#8221; which &#8220;hurt more than anything&#8221;.</p>

<p>TWO hero Brits have been told they could face the death penalty by a Russian prosecutor after they were captured and paraded on TV.</p>



<p>The prosecutor of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic smirked as he told a TV crew that Brit fighter Shaun Pinner, 48, and&nbsp;28-year-old Aiden&nbsp;Aslin could be executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrei Spivak said the men &#8211; who were caught <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">trying to defend Mariupol</a> in mid-April &#8211; were being charged with &#8220;crimes against civilians of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The maximum punishment for these crimes is the death penalty,&#8221; the prosecutor said.</p>



<p>Aiden was heard saying he understood the accusations against him but fiercely denied killing civilians.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s highly unlikely the charges could have been brought without the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Kremlin</a>&#8216;s approval.</p>

<p>Spivak said the men were charged with &#8220;acting deliberately as part of the armed forces of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, being on the territory of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic in a time of war&#8221;.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also accused of trying to &#8220;forcibly seize and retain power&#8221; over the Kremlin-backed breakaway region.</p>



<p>The prosecutor also listed charged including the &#8220;acting deliberately as part of the armed forces of Ukraine, being on the territory of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic in a time of war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aslin is seen saying to the camera: &#8220;I understand fully what I am accused off and I agree with it fully up to the part about murdering civilians. I don&#8217;t agree with [that].</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with the fact that I fought on the territory of the [DPR], and fought against soldiers in peaceful settlements.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">Pinner appeared drained</a> as he acknowledged&nbsp;that the charges.</p>



<p>Both men were captured when their battalions were forced to surrender last month to Russia forces in Mariupol.</p>



<p>Aiden and Shaun &#8211; who fought with Ukraine&#8217;s 36th Marines &#8211; have lived in Ukraine for some time and are fully-paid members of its military.</p>



<p>Aiden joined the Marines in 2018 while Shaun moved to Mariupol four years ago to be with his second wife Larysa when he joined the Ukrainian Army as a &#8220;contract soldier&#8221;.</p>



<p>It comes amid Russian claims the men were &#8220;mercenaries&#8221;.</p>



<p>Under the Geneva Convention fighters can be classed as mercenaries if they are motivated by “private gain”.</p>



<p>And they must be paid &#8220;substantially in excess&#8221; of local soldiers – which both were not.</p>



<p>Legal experts said the convention is crystal clear the men should be treated as combatants with all the protections of a PoW.</p>



<p>Neither of the men were seen openly pleading guilty and its not clear if they were informed about the death penalty.</p>



<p>Russia outlawed capital punishment in 1996 but could reintroduce it.</p>



<p>In February, prime minister Dmitry Medvedev promised to bring it back.</p>



<p>It comes as Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18416439/andrew-hill-brit-fighter-paraded-russian-tv-wounded/">paraded another hero Brit fighter</a> on national TV.</p>



<p>Andrew Hill, a dad of four from Plymouth, appeared wounded with a head bandage and his left arm in a sling after being captured in Mykolaiv.</p>



<p>Hill looked tired and terrified and kept his head bowed as he looked at the floor, occasionally glancing up nervously as he asked if he would ever get back to England.</p>



<p>And it comes days after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">Scott Sibley became the first Briton to be killed in the conflict</a>.</p>

<p>Heels pleaded guilty to a string of offences on Friday including engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, intentionally sexually touching a child and producing child abuse material, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10774037/Benjamin-Heels-Tristan-Cullinan-Smayle-plead-guilty-child-sex-offences.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>

<p>Heels was arrested last May in Berwick, Melbourne after he was caught with child abuse material on an electronic device. </p>



<p>The court heard that the former music teacher who worked at the Fountain Gate Secondary College, produced the material between January and May last year, just days before his arrest.</p>



<p>It comes as a strange Facebook post has emerged where Heels expresses his worry over children singing songs about sex.</p>



<p>The bizarre post reads: &#8220;Please be aware of what your child is singing about.</p>

<p>RUSSIAN state TV has threatened to drown the UK under a radioactive tsunami in a bizarre new propaganda video.</p>



<p>In the chilling broadcast the presenter also showed how the Kremlin&#8217;s latest world-ending Satan 2 nuclear missile could also annihilate Britain.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18435606" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dmitry-Kiselyov-threatening-UK-2-east2west-news.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18435606" width="960" height="537" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russia has threatened more devastating nuclear strikes on Britain</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<figure id="attachment_18435609" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sarmat-ballistic-missile-launch-4-east2west-news.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18435609" width="960" height="621" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The devastating new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile ‘Sarmat’</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The warning comes as the Kremlin raised the prospect of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">devastating military strikes on Britain</a> over its deal to supply weapons to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine.</a></p>



<p>Pro-<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> TV pundits previously threated the use of the world ending <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18358256/putin-boasts-satan-2-nuclear-missile-break-through-defences/">RS-28 Sarmat missile</a> – gleefully spouting its ability to wipe England from the map.</p>



<p>And now raising further plans for all-out war, brazen host Dmitry Kiselyov heralded Russia’s second option to “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea&#8221; with its “underwater robotic drone Poseidon”.</p>



<p>In a chilling graphic he warned the missile would raise a giant tsunami wave up to 1,640ft high.</p>

<p>He later predicted the surging water &#8211; reaching almost halfway up Scafell Pike in the English Lake District &#8211; would contain “high doses of radiation” turning what is left of Britain into a “radioactive desert”.</p>



<p>His double whammy threat was based on the “baseless”&nbsp; premise perpetrated by the Russian state media and officials in the past week&nbsp; that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> had threatened to carry out a nuclear strike on Russia without consulting <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">NATO.</a></p>



<p>Downing Street last week dismissed this as “another example of disinformation peddled by the Kremlin&#8221;, but it continues to be trumpeted  in Moscow.</p>



<p>The invective from Russian state TV appears to get more extreme as Putin’s war in Ukraine becomes more mired with rising losses of troops and armaments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a verbal attack, Kiselyov said Britain &#8211; which has angered Moscow with its steady supplies of weaponry to Kyiv &#8211;  was no match for Russia.</p>



<p>He asked: “And what will happen after Boris Johnson&#8217;s words about a ‘retaliatory strike on Russia’?”</p>



<p>Accusing Britain of “rambling”, he said: “Why do they threaten vast Russia with nuclear weapons while they are only a small island?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The island is so small that one Sarmat missile is enough to drown it once and for all…</p>



<p>“Russian missile Sarmat [aka Satan-2], the world most powerful…is capable of … destroying an area the size of Texas or England.</p>



<p>“A single launch, Boris, and there is no England anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin himself last week darkly warned of using nuclear weapons against the UK and its European allies as devastating nuke maps were broadcast across Russian TV.</p>



<p>It gleefully warned Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>



<p>The Sarmat hypersonic 208-ton ’Satan-2’&nbsp;intercontinental ballistic missile has a speed of 15,880mph and is claimed by the Kremlin leader to be “unstoppable”.</p>



<p>Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">successfully launched the missile </a>earlier this month with Putin warning the test was &#8220;food for thought for those who try to threaten <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&#8220;.</p>



<p>A video showed the killer missile being launched from an underground silo, triggering an enormous fireball.</p>



<p>It travelled almost the entire length of Russia &#8211; almost 3,600 miles &#8211; in around 15 minutes and landed at Kura Missile Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>



<p>The bombs are 1,000 times more powerful than those dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War Two.</p>



<p>It comes as Russia&#8217;s foreign minister warned a nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger as British and NATO weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Sergei Lavrov said the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221; &#8211; saying the West is essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into&nbsp;Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he claimed&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a>&nbsp;at all costs.</p>

<p>It comes as it was revealed that Putin may have to hand power to his shadowy spy chief amid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18402141/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-paranoia-traitors-insane/">rumours of poor health.</a></p>



<p>It has been reported the Russian leader, 69, could go under the knife with power switched to hardliner Nikolai Patrushev, 70, who is a key architect of the war strategy and the man who convinced Putin that Kyiv was awash with neo-Nazis.</p>

<p>A WOMAN has managed to save £63k to buy a house by living on just £5 a month &#8211; here&#8217;s how she did it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-korea/">South Korean</a> youngster Ji-hyeon Kwak shot to fame after sharing her extreme saving hacks on TV.</p>

<p>Ji-hyeon, 24, got her first job at 19 and put aside £63k over four years to finally bag herself a spot on an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/">apartment</a> waiting list.</p>



<p>The thrifty young&#8217;un <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/">pulls in £1,255 (2m won) a month</a>, which is near the minimum wage, and spends as little as £5 (8,400 won) a month on groceries.</p>



<p>Ji-hyeon says she eats a varied diet and uses an elaborate system of coupons and discount cards to make ends meet.</p>



<p>In a recent appearance on South Korea&#8217;s Master of Living programme, the 24-year-old revealed she uses several apps to collect points and coupon codes that she then spends of a variety of products.</p>

<p>And she scans every single one of her receipts and earns a few pounds each time.</p>



<p>She also walks two hours a day to save money on transport, only drinks tap water and homemade tea and eats whatever she can for extremely cheap or wins via her apps.</p>



<p>If she happens to win bottled water, she&#8217;ll sell it online and save the money.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so surprised that I won the first challenge. I wondered if it was a dream or real life.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I got a job when I was 19 and I’ve been working until now, and I have achieved 100 million [won] (£63k) in four years by working on a side job, saving money, and relentlessly. But I have no regrets.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to local <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/economy_general/2022/04/26/5J3355WBR5HSJMWHO6QWTPA534/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media outlets</a>, the monthly minimum wage based on the hourly rate in 2022 is around £1190.</p>



<p>Ji-hyeon said she started saving so she could move out of home.</p>



<p>&#8220;My family situation or environment was not good. Since then, I have been collecting it like crazy,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>She shares her savings tricks on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youtube/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>DRAMATIC footage shows the moment a bomb from a Ukrainian drone flies through the sunroof of a Russian vehicle sending soldiers running for their lives.</p>



<p>In the clip, the bomb can be seen in the air, plummeting towards the target and falling directly into the vehicle. </p>

<p>It then explodes, sending smoke up the sky as terrified Russian troops are fleeing the scene.</p>



<p>It is unclear where the attack took place.</p>



<p>The video was shared on Twitter by government advisor Anton Gerashchenko who said the hit was executed by soldiers from Ukraine&#8217;s 92nd brigade.</p>



<p>Last week <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">another drone strike</a> from what was believed to be Ukraine&#8217;s 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion, destroyed two Russian tanks.</p>

<p>Striking footage showed the devastation caused by the strike as the hit sparked a massive inferno.</p>



<p>Throughout the war, Ukrainian fighters have been using <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17957095/ukraine-russia-turkey-drone-bayraktar-tb2/">relatively cheap drones</a> to cause havoc with Russia.</p>



<p>Videos shared online show Ukraine&#8217;s popular weapon the Bayraktar TB2 destroying Russian missile launchers on the ground.</p>



<p>It is a small Turkish-made unmanned vehicle that has become something of a favourite, despite being quite basic compared to other tech.</p>

<p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are thought to cost about $5million (£3.8million), far cheaper than Israel&#8217;s Heron at $10million (£7.6m), and US drones for about $20million (£15.3m).</p>



<p>Apart from their low cost, they are also smaller and slower but as it turns out quite successful.</p>



<p>Ukraine is known for using relatively simple equipment to fight Putin&#8217;s army since the beginning of the invasion. </p>



<p>Back in March, a squad of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18087524/amateur-drone-users-destroyed-russian-convoy/">amateur drone</a> users claimed they managed to destroy Russia&#8217;s 40-mile <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17914958/russian-troops-kyiv-attack-ukraine-war/">infamous &#8220;death convoy&#8221;</a> of tanks and armoured vehicles in a series of ambushes.</p>



<p>Volunteer experts from specialist air reconnaissance unit Aerorozvidka used drones with thermal image cameras or those capable of dropping small bombs as well as sniper rifles to attack Russian troops.</p>

<p>A PAIR of high school students returned home from a graduation party and were never seen again &#8211; with an answering machine message providing one of the only clues. </p>



<p>Suzanne Streeter and Stacy McCall, 19 and 18, vanished alongside Streeter&#8217;s mum Sherrill Levitt, 47, from their home in Springfield, Missouri, in the US, almost exactly 30 years ago. </p>

<p>Cops remains baffled by the case as decades on no concrete evidence has ever been found to establish what happened to the three women.</p>



<p>The enduring mystery has become known as &#8220;The Springfield Three&#8221; &#8211; and remains unsolved despite more than 5,000 tips to detectives. </p>



<p>And perhaps the biggest mysteries of the case are a &#8220;strange&#8221; answering machine message and a string of &#8220;obscene&#8221; phone calls made to the house the morning of the disappearance. </p>



<p>It also became apparent Suzanne was interested in devil worship and satanism &#8211; and even dated a boy who had been arrested as part of a grave robbing gang. </p>

<p>But amid these enduring mysteries, cops have found no threads, hair, blood, or DNA to give detectives a solid lead in the case.  </p>



<p>Suzanne and Stacy had both graduated Kickapoo High School on June 6, 1992 &#8211; and were last seen at around 2am when they headed back after a party to the Streeter&#8217;s house in East Delmar Street. </p>



<p>The pals were due to go on a trip to a water park their friend&nbsp;Janelle Kirby the following day &#8211; but they never showed up. </p>



<p>Sometime between 2am and 7.30am on June 7 &#8211; they vanished along with Sherrill. </p>



<p>The pals had actually been due to stay with Janelle, but decided the house was too crowded so headed back to Stacy&#8217;s to spend the night.</p>

<p>Janelle, her boyfriend Mike and Stacy&#8217;s mum Janis went to house after the duo failed to show up the next morning. </p>



<p>But when they arrived &#8211; they had little idea they were stumbling into a crime scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;You say &#8216;I love you&#8217; again on the phone and I had no idea that was the last time I was going to hear her voice,&#8221; Janis told <a href="https://truecrimedaily.com/2017/10/17/crime-watch-daily-investigates-the-mysterious-disappearance-of-the-springfield-three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">True Crime Daily</a> in 2017. </p>



<p>With no sign of Suzanne, Stacy, or Stacy&#8217;s mum Sherrill, they explored the house &#8211; and chillingly there was a ringing from the phone.</p>



<p>Janelle answered the phone &#8211; and one the other end was a man&#8217;s voice who made a series of vile &#8220;sexual innuendos&#8221;. </p>



<p>She then hung up, but the phone rung again &#8211; and it was another &#8220;strange and disturbing&#8221; sexual prank call. </p>



<p>Janis described the calls as &#8220;lewd sexual content&#8221; and &#8220;very rude&#8221;. </p>

<p>It was obvious something was very wrong &#8211; with the women nowhere to be seen and all three of their cars were still on the drive. </p>



<p>And later that day there was another strange and obscene message left on the house&#8217;s answering machine.</p>



<p>But it was automatically deleted by the device after it had been listened to &#8211; potentially destroying evidence. </p>



<p>Cops believe this answering machine message may have contained a vital clue to the disappearance of The Springfield Three.</p>



<p>As they explored the house, the strangeness of the scene became apparent to them. </p>



<p>The glass lamp shade on the porch was shattered, and the family dog Cinnamon was locked outside and appeared agitated.  </p>



<p>Money, clothing, keys, cigarettes and other personal items were all left behind and there did not appear to be any obvious signs of a struggle.</p>



<p>All three women&#8217;s purses were lined up and neatly sitting on the floor of the living room &#8211; including Sherrill&#8217;s which was holding $900.</p>



<p>The girl&#8217;s graduation gowns were found in Suzanne&#8217;s bedroom with the TV left on. </p>



<p>They had taken off their make-up and left their jewellery by the sink.</p>



<p>No other clothes appeared missing, so it seems the women vanished in whatever bed clothes they were wearing overnight. </p>



<p>With no clues as to what happened to the trio, Janis called the police and reported them missing as night began to fall. </p>



<p>Sixteen hours after the women were last seen &#8211; detectives arrived and found the crime scene had already been contaminated by up to 20 people as worried friends and family assisted with the search.</p>



<p>The worried pals had unwittingly destroyed potential evidence &#8211; including sweeping up the shattered porch light.</p>



<p>Cops tried to recover the strange answering machine message, but had no luck &#8211; saying there was &#8220;nothing they could do&#8221;.</p>



<p>And with that one of the most important potential leads was lost.</p>



<p>Captain Tony Glenn told News-Leader: &#8220;The only thing unusual about this house was that three women were missing from it.</p>



<p>&#8220;You had this feeling as you looked around that something was missing, that something had to be missing. </p>



<p>&#8220;But there wasn&#8217;t. Just them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Detectives began to research the background of the missing people, and found that Suzanne had unusual interests &#8211; having several books about satanism.</p>



<p>It was revealed she had dated a local &#8220;bad boy&#8221; who had been arrested for breaking into graves and stealing gold teeth from skulls. </p>



<p>But he was quickly tracked down and there was nothing found to link him into the case.</p>



<p>Cops received a lead two weeks later when a member of public spotted a woman driving a van just two miles away from the house.</p>



<p>It was said the woman looked like Suzanne. </p>



<p>The caller said she looked scared and a man was heard threatening her from the back seat of the green panel van.</p>



<p>But despite this potential breakthrough, it ended up coming to nothing as the frustrated police were left at a dead end. </p>



<p>Other leads are pursued &#8211; including reports of a drifter with long hair and a full beard spotted lurking near the house.</p>



<p>With the FBI involved, the women&#8217;s disappearance investigated as potentially the work of a serial killer. </p>



<p>And another tipster claims they saw the three women at George&#8217;s Steakhouse between 1am and 3am on the night they disappeared.</p>



<p>The vanishing was featured on America&#8217;s Most Wanted &#8211; and featured one key caller who claimed to have inside information about the disappearences.</p>



<p>But the anonymous tip line meant cops could never get in touch with him.</p>



<p>And despite appeals by the police for the man to come forward again, he never did and his mystery remains unknown.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18379811" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 264px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dd73cdc3-b99c-410b-bf9c-ddb2d6f4aba3.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=254" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18379811" width="254" height="356" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Robert Craig Cox is one of the few named suspects in the case &#8211; but he has never been charged</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Cops zeroed in some of their inquiries on for US Army veteran Robert Craig Cox &#8211; who had previously been on death row before the case against him was dropped.</p>



<p>He worked at the same car dealership as Stacy&#8217;s dad. </p>



<p>Cox has made a string of contradictory statements about the case, including once claiming he knew the women were dead and where they were buried.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that they&#8217;re dead, I&#8217;ll say that. I know that,&#8221; he told local TV reporter Dennis Graves.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, but I just know that they&#8217;re dead. That&#8217;s not my theory, I just know that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cox then told Graves he wouldn&#8217;t say anything else until his mum passes. </p>



<p>His parents however have given him an alibi on the night of their disappearance, even though his girlfriend revealed she lied for him over a separate alibi for the morning of June 7.  </p>



<p>He was imprisoned for kidnap and robbery in Texas, and was sentenced to death over the murder of Sharon Zellers in Orlando, Florida.</p>



<p>Cox spent nine years on death row &#8211; but the Florida Supreme Court later overruled the conviction of the former US Army ranger due to a lack of evidence.</p>



<p>Cops remain unsure over his links to the case &#8211; with some suspected he was merely stringing police along by suggesting he had information about the Springfield Three. </p>



<p>The case remains open &#8211; and one of the leading theories remains that the women were buried beneath the parking lot of Cox Hospital.</p>



<p>At the time the area was under construction and was an empty dirt lot before being paved over and used to erect the garage.</p>



<p>Ground penetrating radar was used during an investigation in 2007 &#8211; and three anomalies in the shape of graves were found.</p>



<p>However, local officials refuse to dig up the area citing cost and damage to the structure.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have also questioned the authenticity of the tip that lead to the find, saying it came from someone who claimed to be &#8220;psychic&#8221;. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>VLADIMIR Putin is likely to be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s and early stage Dementia while his paranoia and fear over traitors is driving him insane, a former KGB agent has said. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian tyrant&#8217;s</a> health has long been the source of speculation, with Western intelligence suggesting he has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1832396/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">serious health issues</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18403071" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/d7c96e46-00e5-416a-a45a-fdfba74f96aa-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403071" width="960" height="648" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin at Orthodox Easter mass at the Christ The Saviour Cathedral in Moscow</figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>



<p>Despite Putin&#8217;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov insisting Putin&#8217;s health is &#8220;excellent&#8221;, his recent public appearances following the shambolic <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine invasion</a> have<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/">&nbsp;sparked rumours about his physical state</a>.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17420978/former-russian-spy-uk-death-threats/">ex-Russian spy Boris Karpichkov</a>, 62,&nbsp;said even members of Putin&#8217;s inner circle would not be told about the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17806903/does-vladimir-putin-have-parkinsons-disease/">state of his health</a> in order to protect his &#8220;strongman&#8221; image.</p>



<p>The Russian defector, who now lives in the UK, said paranoid Putin views everyone as a &#8220;traitor&#8221; &#8211; and his health was an &#8220;especially sensitive issue&#8221; .</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17425280/ex-kgb-spy-tortured-hellhole-russian-jail/">former double agent</a> told The Sun Online: &#8220;He is &#8211; or at least acts &#8211; insane and obsessed by paranoia ideas. </p>

<p>&#8220;He sees literally everyone, including those inside the Russian security services and even inside his close inner circle, to be &#8216;traitors&#8217;. </p>



<p>&#8220;He is so suspicious and so obsessed with his paranoia ideas that he can be now compared with Stalin tyrant.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Karpichkov said it is likely Mad Vlad is suffering from &#8220;numerous&#8221; health conditions, such as the early stages of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dementia/">Dementia</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/parkinsons/">Parkinson&#8217;s</a>. </p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I am not a medic myself&#8230; but there is a serious concern that Putin is suffering from numerous physical health conditions &#8211; possibly from the sport injuries during his younger years.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is along with some issues which affect older people &#8211; such as Dementia in the early stages. </p>

<p>&#8220;But he is well known in his inner circle as a person who &#8216;does not forget anything&#8217; and who recalls details of many people he met.</p>



<p>&#8220;Another potential issue might be &#8211; judging from how he moves &#8211; that Putin can is suffering from the initial stages of either Parkinson&#8217;s, or another serious disorder caused by some form of cancer, brain tumour, for example.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="http://thesun.co.uk/topic/kremlin">Kremlin</a> officials have always denied there is anything wrong with their leader, who turns 70 in October.</p>



<p>But Putin appeared <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18397441/putin-health-fears-struggling-breathe-speech/">confused and out of breath as he wheezed</a> his way through his latest speech, threatening the West with nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>The president&nbsp;seemed to struggle to catch his breath and paused several times during the address to politicians, stumbling over his words and looking exhausted.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18397441/putin-health-fears-struggling-breathe-speech/#"></a><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18390888/how-kremlin-tightly-controls-putin-hide-ill-health/#"></a></p>



<p>And last week, during talks with his defence minister Sergey Shoigu, the elderly tyrant was filmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping the table and slouching</a>, sparking further rumours he may be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Professor Erik&nbsp;Bucy, a body language expert from Texas Tech University, told The Sun Online upon watching the video: &#8220;It’s an astonishingly weakened Putin compared to the man we observed even a few years ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;An able-bodied president would not need to keep himself propped up with a hand held out for leverage and would not be concerned about keeping both feet planted on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/">Russian leader&#8217;s hands trembled violently</a>&nbsp;in a video clip showing him greeting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belarus/">Belarusian</a>&nbsp;President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15064105/who-belarus-president-alexander-lukashenko/">Alexander Lukashenko</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Kremlin.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/#"></a></p>

<figure id="attachment_18403215" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/4d187781-875a-40c5-a07c-47c820ac7ae6.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403215" width="960" height="641" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin speaks during the Council of Lawnmakers at the Tauride Palace</figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>



<p>The footage showed a frail-looking&nbsp;Putin&nbsp;holding his hand out to greet Lukashenko before retracting and walking around the room.</p>



<p>His knees then buckle as he walks to embrace his Belarusian counterpart in the undated footage.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the latest video calling the monster&#8217;s health into question after recent footage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18356517/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-health-rumours-easter/">showed Putin&nbsp;biting his lips and fidgeting</a>&nbsp;distractedly at a church service on Sunday further stoked claims the autocrat has a terminal illness.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, a video seemed to show&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383848/putin-limping-meeting-un-chief/">him limp and grimace</a>&nbsp;as he walked during talks in Moscow with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>



<p>And in a separate video, a dishevelled Putin was seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping a table and tapping his foot</a>&nbsp;in video that&nbsp;Kremlin&nbsp;watchers claimed showed a drastic decline in his physical state.</p>



<p>Experts have also pointed out that he looks &#8220;bloated&#8221; and &#8220;weakened&#8221; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18133008/chilling-new-clues-putin-thyroid-cancer-parkinsons/">has even seen a doctor who specialises in Thyroid cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Putin has long prided himself on his &#8220;strongman&#8221; image but his dramatic change over the past few years has prompted speculation that he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17981023/vladimir-putin-body-language-disease-symptoms/">may be suffering from a severe physical illness</a>.</p>



<p>The despot seems to be always surrounded by security, following a detailed programme and only attending a small number of meetings- for a short time.</p>

<p>A BRIT dad is facing the death penalty in Iraq after being accused of attempting to smuggle broken pottery.</p>



<p>Retired geologist Jim Fitton, 66, is set to miss his daughter&#8217;s wedding after being detained in the country for five weeks in what his desperate family have branded a &#8220;living nightmare&#8221;.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18432138" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729245705.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18432138" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>PA</figcredit></figure>Brit Jim Fitton, pictured with wife Sarijah, is facing the death penalty in Iraq[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18432145" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729492613.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18432145" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>SWNS</figcredit></figure>The dad-of-two, 66, with daughter Leila, son Joshua and Sarijah[/caption]



<p>The dad-of-two collected stones and shards of broken pottery as souvenirs while visiting a site in Eridu, in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iraq">Iraq</a>&#8216;s south-east, as part of an organised geology and archaeology tour.</p>



<p>But the items were judged to be artefacts under Iraqi law and the charge levelled at Mr Fitton states &#8220;whoever exported or intended to export, deliberately, an antiquity, from Iraq, shall be punishable with execution&#8221;.</p>



<p>His daughter Leila and her husband Sam Tasker, from Bath, in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/somerset/">Somerset</a>, say the sentencing this month is expected to coincide with a long-planned celebration of their wedding.</p>



<p>They said: &#8220;There is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it&#8217;s been turned into an absolute living nightmare.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have accepted the fact that, without timely intervention from the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), Jim will be unable to attend this ceremony too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Fitton has been detained in Iraq for five weeks after being accused of attempting to smuggle historic artefacts out of the country.</p>



<p>His case in connection with the March incident is expected to go for sentencing in the week beginning May 8.</p>



<p>Ministers have come under increasing pressure to help free Mr Fitton as he faces the death penalty.</p>

<p>A petition urging for his release set by his son Joshua and daughter has received more than 97,000 signatures in the three days since it was launched.</p>



<p>Mr Fitton&#8217;s family described the response to the petition as &#8220;unbelievable&#8221;, adding in a statement: &#8220;Jim really appreciates the support from old colleagues, good friends, kindred spirits, and complete strangers who have not allowed this to go unnoticed.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will continue to fight while we continue to have you at our backs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Fitton worked as a geologist for oil and gas companies during his career and lives in his adopted home of Malaysia with his wife, Sarijah.</p>



<p>Wera Hobhouse, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, has raised his case with ministers in the House of Commons.</p>



<p>The family said their lawyer has drafted a proposal under Iraqi law to have the case closed before trial but they need the Foreign Office to &#8220;put their weight behind the plan and endorse it&#8221; so they can secure a high-level meeting with judicial officials in the country.</p>



<h2 id="life-in-the-balance">&#8216;LIFE IN THE BALANCE&#8217;</h2>



<p>The proposal cites the &#8220;clear lack of criminality, that Jim is a victim of poor guidance and circumstance, and also cites the huge investment that the UK has made in the Iraqi governmental and judicial framework through FCDO funding in the past few years&#8221;.</p>



<p>The family statement, via an update on the petition website, also explained: &#8220;Leila has not seen Jim for more than two years due to Covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>&#8220;We held a small Covid wedding ceremony in Bath in August of last year for close friends and our British family members, mostly on my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have, since then, been planning a larger celebration in Malaysia with all of Leila&#8217;s extended family. This is scheduled on May 8.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ms Hobhouse said: &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to imagine what Jim and his family are going through, especially as Sam and Leila are planning their wedding.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are pressing the Foreign Office to intervene but sadly they are continuing to refuse. I cannot understand why the Foreign Office is not intervening when Jim&#8217;s life lays in the balance.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Foreign Office must do everything in their power to bring Jim back home to his family.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Foreign Office has said it is providing consular support and is in contact with the local authorities.</p>

<p>Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Ms Hobhouse, said last week: &#8220;We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton&#8217;s case and the UK&#8217;s opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IN the early 1970s, the Supreme Court took up a landmark case titled Roe v. Wade to determine the future of abortion rights across the United States.</p>
<p>Since then, the ruling has been threatened as <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3587553/roe-v-wade-deadly-shootings-abortion-clinics/">many have tried to get it overturned</a>.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_14984606" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14984606 size-thesun-article-image" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000653968904.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure> The 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade determined the future of abortions in the United States[/caption]</p>
<h2>What is Roe v Wade?</h2>
<p>The 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade asserted the 14th amendment and declared access to safe and legal <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/3782462/uk-abortion-laws-nhs-termination-alabma-illegal/">abortion</a> as a constitutional right.</p>
<p>The case was heard to decide if <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/texas/">Texas</a>&#8216; ban on abortions, which were completely outlawed except when a woman&#8217;s life was in danger, was constitutional.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court voted 7-2 in favor of the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>It said women had a right to privacy, which meant it was up to them to decide whether to continue their pregnancy.</p>
<p>It also divided pregnancy into three trimesters, declaring that the first three months are solely at the discretion of the woman.</p>
<p>In the second trimester, the states can regulate abortions in the interests of the woman&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>In the last three months, states can prohibit abortions in the interest of the fetus, provided the pregnancy will not bring harm to the pregnant woman.</p>

<p>Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in the case after the decision had been made.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also voting in support of Roe was Justices Burger, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall and Powell.</p>
<p>After the decision 46 states needed to change their abortion laws to comply with the ruling.</p>
<p>Abortion has proved to be one of the most divisive moral issues in recent years, with &#8216;pro-life&#8217; groups comparing the procedure to murder.</p>
<p>On the flip side, &#8216;pro-choice&#8217; groups argue that abortion should be safe and legal for anyone who needs one.</p>
<p>The number of abortions performed each year has been falling.</p>
<p>For women ages 15 to 44, the abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) dropped 26 percent between 2006 and 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>In 2006, US medical professionals reported performing 842,855 abortions but by 2015, that number dropped to 638,169.</p>
<h2>Is Roe v Wade being overturned?</h2>
<p>On May 2, 2022, an initial draft majority opinion written by <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/5250627/who-is-samuel-alito/">Justice Samuel Alito</a> was obtained by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico</a> and revealed a rejection of <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/2904633/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-abortion-ruling/">the landmark 1973 decision</a> which guaranteed constitutional protection of abortion rights.</p>
<p>The draft revealed that the Supreme Court has &#8220;voted to strike down the Roe v Wade decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,” Alito wrote in the document obtained by Politico.</p>
<p>“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitution provision…”</p>
<p>He also mentioned the 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v Casey, which upheld Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>The justice wrote that <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/5250597/supreme-court-overturn-abortion-decision-draft/">the document</a> is the &#8220;opinion of the court&#8221; and added that “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representative.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alito added &#8220;We emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What law did Texas pass about abortions in 2021?</h2>
<p>Just months before Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3580055/what-is-the-texas-abortion-law/">Texas passed a law banning abortion</a> from as early as six weeks.</p>
<p>It bans abortions after the detection of the &#8220;fetal heartbeat,&#8221; which some medical authorities have deemed misleading.</p>
<p>The law took effect after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency appeal by abortion providers.</p>
<p>It gives any individual the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point.</p>
<p>The law, known as the Heartbeat Act, was signed into effect by <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1056378/greg-abbott-texas-governor-wheelchair/">Texas governor Greg Abbott</a> in May 2021.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), then requested that the Supreme Court block the legislation.</p>
<p>On September 1, the ACLU confirmed that the court had &#8220;not responded to our request&#8221;, adding: &#8220;Access to almost all abortion has just been cut off for millions of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has described the law as &#8220;blatantly unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texan women who wish to have an abortion after six weeks will need to travel across state lines to find a physician or clinic that can perform the procedure.</p>
<p>Americans may be able to seek up to $10,000 in damages in a civil court against abortion providers as well as anyone who &#8220;aids and abets&#8221; an illegal abortion.</p>
<p>In theory, this could mean clinic staff and family members could all be targeted for a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The ACLU has said that the law will encourage &#8220;a bounty hunting scheme&#8221; of costly &#8220;vigilante lawsuits&#8221; designed to harass women seeking an abortion.</p>

<p>AS Vladimir Putin&#8217;s troops poured into Ukraine, the so-called Ghost of Kyiv became a symbol of resistance and was quickly hailed a hero amid claims the ace had downed dozens of enemy planes.</p>



<p>And so Ukrainians were gutted when it was claimed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18415688/legendary-ghost-kyiv-fighter-pilot-killed-battle/">brave fighter had been killed in combat</a> after macho propaganda of the masked pilot shooting down <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> jets saw his popularity soar.</p>

<p>The Ghost of Kyiv had been named last week as 29-year-old Stepan Tarabalka &#8211; who died in battle on March 13.</p>



<p>He  was posthumously awarded Ukraine’s top medal for bravery in combat, the Order of the Golden Star, with the title Hero of Ukraine.</p>



<p>But the Ukraine Air Force Command has now said Tarabalka was NOT the Ghost of Kyiv as the truth of the morale-boosting pilot is not so clear cut.</p>



<p>It warned the ace is a merely a &#8220;character&#8221; rather than an actual person.</p>

<p>A Facebook post said: &#8220;Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!&#8221;.</p>



<p>The messaged urged people to &#8220;check the sources of information, before spreading it&#8221;.</p>



<p>It stressed that &#8220;Tarabalka is not &#8216;Ghost of Kiev&#8217;, and he did not hit 40 planes&#8221;.</p>



<p>The post described the flying ace as &#8220;a collective image of pilots of the Air Force&#8217;s 40th tactical aviation brigade, who defend the sky over the capital&#8221; &#8211; rather just one pilot&#8217;s record.</p>

<p>Back in March, the Ukrainian military shared a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18415688/legendary-ghost-kyiv-fighter-pilot-killed-battle/">snap showing a person wearing an oxygen mask in the cockpit </a>of an MiG-29 fighter jet, with the caption “Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!”.</p>



<p>And he Ukrainian government’s official account posted a 38-second clip on their social media back on February 27, writing: “People call him the Ghost of Kyiv.</p>



<p>&#8220;And rightly so – this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircrafts.”</p>



<p>Footage purported to show the MiG-29 jet soaring through the air before destroying six Kremlin planes on the first day Putin launched his war.</p>



<p>But one of the videos was debunked by experts as being from the 2008 videogame Digital Combat Simulator &#8211; fuelling suspicions the ace had been made up as officials tried to rally support for their resistance against the Russian invasion.</p>



<p>The footage starts with a cartoon mock-up of the plane, before going into the debunked footage of a destroyed Russian jet.</p>



<p>Text then appears on the video, which states: “Ukraine probably got its first ace since World War II. This is the anonymous pilot of the MiG-29, nicknamed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17796004/who-ghost-of-kyiv-real/">Ghost of Kyiv.</a></p>

<p>MADELEINE McCann suspect Christian B could be charged by the end of summer, it&#8217;s reported.</p>



<p>The rapist, 45, was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">declared an “arguido”</a>&nbsp;by police in Portugal ahead of the 15th anniversary of the three-year-old vanishing on the Algarve.</p>

<p>And they claim to have evidence proving beyond doubt that she was murdered soon after.</p>



<p>Sources suggested forensic work was ongoing to trace “potentially crucial” evidence from a VW van he drove at the time.</p>



<p>But the suspect — serving seven years in a German jail for raping an OAP in Portugal — denies involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p>



<p>Yet he has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383657/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-alibi-german-cops/">not provided an alibi to police</a>, according to cops.</p>



<p>The convicted paedophile has told a US documentary he was elsewhere when the Brit when the tot was snatched.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters told The Sun: “We’re not aware of any alibi at all.”</p>



<p>The frustrated investigators believe the prime suspect is “playing games with them”.</p>



<p>After stonewalling German interrogators,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">Christian B</a> has instead chosen to give details of his alleged alibi to a US TV documentary.</p>



<p>Prosecutors will remain none the wiser until&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/">Madeleine McCann: Prime Suspect</a>&nbsp;is aired on Tuesday — the 15th anniversary of the three-year-old Brit’s abduction.</p>

<p>AROUND 100 civilians escaped the Azovstal “Alamo” yesterday in an evacuation from blitzed port city Mariupol.</p>



<p>A local ceasefire allowed them to flee the sprawling steel plant where diehard bands of Ukrainian soldiers have made a desperate last stand against the Russian invaders.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> confirmed the mercy mission had started after weeks of crushing false starts.</p>



<p>The UN and Red Cross-backed rescue raised hopes for thousands of others trapped in tunnels and bunkers in the last part of the ruined city still in Ukrainian hands.</p>



<p>Mr Zelensky said: “The evacuation of civilians from Azovstal began.</p>



<p>“The first group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area. Tomorrow we will meet them in Zaporizhzhia.”</p>

<p>But hundreds of wounded soldiers are rotting with gangrene — still underground and without access to painkillers.</p>



<p>The breakthrough came as details emerged of a ninth Russian general killed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p>Major-General Andrei Simonov, 55, an electronics warfare expert, reportedly died in a command post blitzed by Ukrainian rockets.</p>



<p>The Kremlin’s top commander, General Valery Gerasimov, was also reportedly hurt in the same devastating strike in Izyum, in Kharkiv province.</p>

<p>Kyiv’s former interior minister Arsen Avakov said Gerasimov suffered a flesh wound yesterday, with sources suggesting his “legs and hips are damaged”.</p>



<p>It was also said that three of his entourage had been killed.</p>



<p>As Chief of the Russian General Staff, Gerasimov had been sent by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> to take personal control of the tyrant’s push to grab territory in eastern Ukraine.</p>



<p>Footage shared on social media appears to show the strike from a rocket salvo.</p>



<p>The attack also reportedly destroyed more than 30 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks.</p>



<p>An unofficial Russian source reported Gerasimov suffered “a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture”.</p>



<p>If true, his wounding is another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign. Gerasimov had swooped into occupied Izyum — now a major staging post — to take charge of the battle for the eastern Donbas region.</p>



<p>The dreaded second-wave onslaught looks to have failed to achieve its objectives of conquering Donetsk and Luhansk in time for Putin’s May 9 Victory Day parade.</p>



<p>After suffering a “sharp injury” in the bombardment, Gerasimov was later spotted at Belgorod, 20 miles inside Russia, where he landed on a helicopter and left on a military plane. A witness said he walked onboard the plane unaided.</p>



<p>If it is confirmed the command post was hit as Gerasimov visited, it would be a major coup for western intelligence partners, as well as Ukraine’s armed forces.</p>



<p>Western sources briefed Ukraine on almost every detail of Putin’s invasion and gaps were revealed by Russian soldiers who discussed key objectives on open telephone lines.</p>



<p>Ukraine continued to hit Russian soil yesterday with a strike on an ammunition dump. Thick plumes of smoke were spotted over the base in Belgorod.</p>



<p>Russia said that it had hit back with missile strikes on a disused airport in Odesa.</p>



<p>Moscow said it launched “high precision Onyx missiles” at a hangar full of “weapons and ammunition delivered from the United States and European countries”.</p>



<p>Russia also claimed to have hit two S-300 air defence systems, which are key to intercepting missiles and planes.</p>



<p>Earlier, strikes on Russian soil were confirmed with satellite photos which showed devastated fuel depots in the city of Bryansk.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the UK’s ambassador to Ukraine says she feels “comfortable” returning to Kyiv despite Russian threats against diplomats in the Ukrainian capital.</p>



<p>Melinda Simmons arrived on Friday, following the announcement last month that Britain would be reopening its embassy in the city in a show of support for Ukraine’s fight against the invasion.</p>

<p>Her return comes after Moscow threatened a “proportional response” against the UK for backing Ukrainian strikes behind Russian lines, hinting at possible strikes at British sites in Kyiv.</p>



<p>PM Boris Johnson had said staff would begin returning thanks to Ukraine repelling Moscow’s troops from around the city.</p>

<p>HERO Ukrainians are using tiny Mad Max style buggies to obliterate monster Russian tanks &#8211; and even take down planes.</p>



<p>Mounted with Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile systems on their roofs, the nippy two-seater vehicles are wreaking havoc for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>&#8216;s forces as they are wielded by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine">Ukrainian</a> defenders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> troops have suffered severe losses since the war began in February with Ukraine claiming it has killed more than 23,000 of Moscow&#8217;s soldiers.</p>



<p>The wrecks of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war">Putin’s war</a> machines also litter the land he ordered his forces to invade as Ukraine also claims it has destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>The brave defenders have been using inexpensive battle buggies amid their display of defiance that has stunned the world.</p>



<p>In a David versus Goliath style battle, Ukrainian hit and run raid teams have been fielding the Ranger UTVs against some of Russia&#8217;s most terrifying and lethal armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Armed with a Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile systems (ATGMs) on their roofs, the all-terrain vehicles have proved no match for Russia&#8217;s arsenal as they can strike ground vehicles as well as low-flying aircraft.</p>



<p>Developed by the Kyiv design bureau Luch, they typically fire 130-millimetre calibre missiles and can be operated by remote control from a distance of up to 50 metres.</p>



<p>Ukraine has assembled a formidable anti-tank force with large numbers of missiles from the UK, US, Germany and others adding to its own arsenal.</p>



<p>Luch&#8217;s description of the missile says they are &#8220;designed to destroy manpower and stationary and mobile modern armoured targets with combined, carried or monolithic armour including ERA (explosive reactive armour) and also pinpoint targets like weapon emplacements, lightly armoured objects and hovered helicopters at any time of day or night&#8221;.</p>

<p>Pictures shared on social media show the two-seater buggies in all their glory, painted in camouflage colours.</p>



<p>The formidable missile was caught on camera destroying a Russian tank.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18047162/russian-tank-obliterated-ukrainian-missile/">Drone footage showed the Russian tank exploding</a> into a fireball the moment it was ambushed on a road.</p>



<p>Flames poured into a line of trees on one side as burning pieces of debris were hurled in the direction of a nearby factory on the other and soon the tank was engulfed in thick smoke.</p>



<p>Putin&nbsp;expect a quick victory when he ordered the invasion of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&nbsp;</a>but fierce resistance has seen a mounting death toll, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18032566/putin-loses-fifth-colonel-in-ukraine-invasion-russia/">several generals and senior officers&nbsp;</a>among the dead.</p>



<p>Ukrainian fighters have&nbsp;put up<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">&nbsp;strong resistance</a>&nbsp;after weeks of fighting which has led to humiliating losses for Moscow.</p>

<p>AN OUTRAGED employee has shared how their boss has asked to check their phone battery level every day to make sure they are working during company time.</p>



<p>The worker explained that their manager was convinced the company&#8217;s low performance was due to the time employees spent on their phones. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18430932" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 933px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729939338.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=923" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430932" width="923" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>The boss asked to see screenshots of his employee&#8217;s phones&#8217; battery levels[/caption]



<p>The frustrated employee said their boss who manages a company in Wuhan, China made the bizarre request that all his staff would send him screenshots of their phone battery usage before leaving work. </p>



<p>The worker added that a group of employees who were unhappy with the situation brought up the issue with the supervisor.</p>



<p>He noted however that most of them did not want to take the matter further fearing they would lose their jobs.</p>



<p>The employee has divided opinions after they posted the invasive tactic on Weibo as users branded it &#8220;useless&#8221; while others advised staff to quit and find a job with a better working environment.</p>

<p>DRAMATIC footage shared online appears to show a Russian soldier being blown up during a live stream.</p>



<p>The young soldier can be seen filming himself walking through a warzone as he apparently bragged about killing Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The unverified clip that was shared by Ukraine&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, shows the man talking to the camera.</p>



<p>He appears to be saying: &#8220;The main task is done with an A+ mark. We have a total of three wounded.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moments later a massive explosion knocks him to the ground.</p>



<p>It is currently unknown whether the soldier survived the blast.</p>

<p>It comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428145/putins-top-military-commander-wounded-ukraine/">Russia&#8217;s top military commander</a> was reportedly sent back to Russia after he was wounded- just days after he arrived to take charge of the war.</p>



<p>The Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov had been sent by Putin to take personal control of his push to grab territory in Donbas and eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian forces have suffered severe losses during Vladimir Putin&#8217;s bloody war with Ukraine claiming it has killed over 23,000 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion.</p>



<p>Ukraine also claims it has destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>

<p>Earlier today <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">another top commander</a> was killed as Putin lost his ninth general since he started the war on February 24.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Simonov&nbsp;head of the 2nd Combined Arms Army was reportedly killed near the city of Izyum in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">Striking footage</a> that emerged yesterday showed the moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike, believed to be from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>



<p>Ukrainian fighters have&nbsp;put up<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/"> strong resistance</a>&nbsp;after weeks of fighting which has led to humiliating losses for Moscow.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s failed invasion has so far seen <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">dozens of Russian commanders </a>killed as well as the sinking of flagship Moskva<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/"> in the Black Sea after being hit by Ukrainian Neptune missiles</a>.</p>



<p>Russian troops have been forced out of Kyiv and have now focused on Ukraine&#8217;s eastern Donbas region where fighting continues.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">officials have warned</a> that the Russian leader&#8217;s army chiefs have urged him to launch an all-out war on Ukraine as &#8220;payback&#8221;.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin&#8217;s top military commander has been wounded in Ukraine and was sent back to Russia just days after he arrived to take charge of the war.</p>



<p>The Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov had been sent by Putin to take personal control of his push to grab territory in Donbas and eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18430531" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729925568.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430531" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Gerasimov was reportedly wounded in Izyum[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18430656" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 699px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729893171-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=689" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430656" width="689" height="520" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Major General Andrei Simonov was reportedly killed in an attack in Izyum</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The unconfirmed claim is that Gerasimov, 66,&nbsp; was wounded in Izyum in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, which is at the centre of intense fighting.</p>



<p>It is also where Russia’s ninth general Major General Andrei Simonov, 55, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">was killed</a>, according to reports today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footage shared on social media appears to show the strike from a rocket salvo.</p>



<p>The attack also reportedly destroyed over 30 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks.</p>

<p>And now an unofficial Russian source reported that Gerasimov who had just arrived at the region on Thursday sustained “a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture. </p>



<p>“The shard was removed &#8211; there is no danger to life.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian government official Anton Gerashchenko said the attack on Izyum was “the very place where…Gerasimov, who personally came to lead the attack on Slavyansk, was located”.</p>



<p>A “large number” of senior officers were killed, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro-Ukr Telegram channel Vertikal said Gerasimov had been “wounded near Izyum”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our source reports that his legs and hips are damaged.”</p>



<p>It suggested that three of his entourage had been killed and the chief of the general staff was evacuated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agentstvo media outlet reported that he was flown out of the war zone initially by an Mi-8 military helicopter to Belgorod in western Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Separately, a military site in Belgorod region was seen on fire in videos, caused by a suspected Ukrainian attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three Ka-52 attack helicopters circled as the Mi-8 transported him and other top brass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then in Belgorod, he boarded a Defence Ministry Tu-154 plane which flew to an unknown destination.</p>



<p>Founder of independent Conflict Intelligence Team Ruslan Leviev said an eyewitness at the airport had seen Gerasimov board the plane unaided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The source confirms that it was Gerasimov who flew away,” he posted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But he went on board himself, alive and well.&#8221;</p>

<p>If true, his wounding even if minor by the Ukrainians is another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gerasimov is in charge of the Russian war campaign alongside defence minister Sergei Shoigu.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin has two sons with his secret gymnast lover, the doctor who delivered the boys has reportedly confirmed.</p>



<p>The 69-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian tyrant </a>has long rumoured to be in a relationship with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/">Alina Kabaeva</a>, 38, but fresh details have now emerged about their two sons.</p>

<figure id="attachment_18429852" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/msemail_Vladimir_Putin__Alina_Kabaeva_-2-_east2west_newsjpg-JS729899094.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18429852" width="960" height="618" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Vladimir Putin has reportedly been in a relationship with Kabaeva for 13 years</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Alina is said to live the life of a First Lady of Russia, with a fleet of limousines at her disposal and a squad of machine gun-toting security guards for her protection.</p>



<p>But while Putin acknowledges his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/18206061/putins-daughters-slapped-with-sanctions/">two daughters</a> from his marriage to Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, which ended in 2013, he has kept his relationship with Kabaeva, as well as any other children, under wraps.</p>



<p>Now the Swiss newspaper Sonntagszeitung has revealed he has two sons by her, with one born in Switzerland in 2015 amid huge security and the other in 2019 in Russia.</p>



<p>The fresh detail contradicts rumours that Putin and the Olympic gold medal winner had twins in 2018.</p>

<p>The paper says its source is a personal friend of Kabaeva who also knows the doctor who delivered the two boys and confirmed the details about their birth.</p>



<p>The Russian-born female medic works at Clinica Sant’Anna in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of Switzerland where the first child was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same doctor delivered the second son in Moscow in 2019, says the paper and before the birth, Kabaeva had travelled in secret to Lugano several times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source described Kabaeva as “a very pleasant woman adding “she is a real sportswoman, very straight, without posturing”.</p>

<p>Kabaeva had also&nbsp;travelled multiple times to Switzerland before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently rumours suggested that she and her children were hiding out the war at a Swiss chalet retreat.</p>



<p>But ten days ago &#8211; after a four-month absence from the limelight &#8211; she reappeared in Moscow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She defied sanctions to wear a £2,000 dress as she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18363180/putins-mistress-dress-z-symbol-parade-after-hiding/">hosted a Z-symbol parade</a> in support of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The new revelations come as it emerged Putin is set to<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18422816/putin-undergo-cancer-operation/"> undergo an operation for cancer</a> and hand power to his spy chief.</p>



<p>Kabaeva is retired rhythmic gymnast once dubbed &#8220;Russia&#8217;s most flexible woman&#8221;.</p>



<p>She won Bronze at the 2000 Olympics in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sydney/">Sydney</a> and went on to win Gold at the 2004 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/10504587/greek-capital-athens-isnt-just-about-famous-ruins-it-makes-a-great-city-break/">Athens</a> Games.</p>



<p>Putin was pictured giving her a medal in 2001 before she was stripped of six of her world championship medals for doping.</p>



<p>After retiring, Kabaeva began her career in politics and was a Member of the Russian Parliament between 2007 and 2014, representing the United Russia party.</p>



<p>She posed semi-nude for a men&#8217;s magazine in 2004.</p>



<p>Putin announced his divorce from Ocheretnaya in 2013, and a spokesman denied he was having an affair, claiming he was too busy.</p>



<p>In 2016, Kabaeva appeared in public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1883377/vladimir-putins-lover-spotted-in-public-wearing-wedding-ring/">wearing a ring on her ring finger</a>, which she seemed to attempt to hide from the cameras.</p>



<p>Another of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13325644/putin-love-child-social-media/">Elizaveta Krivonogikh</a>&nbsp;in November 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13302399/vladimir-putin-secret-love-child-cleaner-erotic-shows/">Elizaveta was named</a>&nbsp;as Putin’s secret daughter by investigative media outlet Proekt backed by a visual computing expert at a British university.</p>

<p>Her mother Svetlana Krivonogikh, 45, is alleged to have had an affair with the strongman leader when he was head of the FSB counterintelligence service, prime minister and during his first term as Russian president.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin has lost his ninth general while fighting in Ukraine following an attack on a military base.</p>



<p>The tyrant&#8217;s war has taken a toll on Russia&#8217;s army as Major General Andrei Simonov became the most recent top commander to die in battle.</p>

<p>Footage shared on social media appears to show the strike from a rocket salvo.</p>



<p>The attack also reportedly destroyed over 30 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks.</p>



<p>Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said during an interview that about 100 Russians were killed in the attack, including Simonov.</p>

<p>Last month Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284616/eighth-russian-general-killed-ukraine-blow-putins-failed-invasion/">was laid to rest</a> with full military honours in St Petersburg.</p>



<p>Previously Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18000210/putin-loses-fifth-general-blow-invasion-ukraine/">was killed in battle</a>&nbsp;at Chornobaivka, near the southern city of Kherson.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th Combined Arms Army and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17877568/russian-general-killed-ukraine-vladimir-putin/">Vitaly Gerasimov</a>, died in fighting.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky&nbsp;was reportedly<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17837254/russian-general-dead-ukraine-sniper/">&nbsp;shot dead by a sniper</a> at the battle for Hostomel Airfield about 30 miles outside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17795690/kyiv-kiev-ukraine-spelling-pronunciation/">capital Kyiv</a>&nbsp;in early March.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17781459/missile-strikes-third-night-fighting-2/">General Magomed Tushaev&nbsp;</a>died when his Chechen special forces column, including 56 tanks, was obliterated near Hostomel, north-east of the city.</p>



<p>Major-General Oleg Mityaev, 47, died in Mariupol as well as Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev who also died in fighting.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the invasion on February 24, Russia has lost over 21,000 but Moscow has failed to give accurate figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>&nbsp;claims it has killed more than 23,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">dramatic footage</a> showed the moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike, believed to be from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>

<p>Concerns for Vladimir Putin&#8217;s health were raised after he was described as &#8220;ashen and bloated&#8221; in images released by the Kremlin.</p>



<p>Here is the latest on the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian President&#8217;s </a>health.</p>

<h2 id="is-vladimir-putin-ill">Is Vladimir Putin ill?</h2>



<p>Photos of Vladimir Putin have appeared to show him with a bloated face.</p>



<p>The images were released before Russia was slammed for bombing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17815165/what-happened-at-babyn-yar/">Babyn Yar </a>Holocaust memorial in Kyiv.</p>



<p>Fiona Hill, the British former senior White House expert on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>: &#8220;Putin’s not looking so great, he’s been rather puffy-faced.</p>



<p>Hill added that it is known that the 69-year-old has back issues but it could be &#8220;something worse&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17981023/vladimir-putin-body-language-disease-symptoms/">Body language experts</a> have claimed that he could be suffering from a &#8220;serious disease and on the verge of a breakdown&#8221;.</p>



<p>A new investigation by Proekt media has revealed the tyrant is “constantly” accompanied by a doctor specialising in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18133008/chilling-new-clues-putin-thyroid-cancer-parkinsons/">thyroid cancer</a>.</p>



<p>The report states that thyroid cancer specialist surgeon, Yevgeny Selivanov, has flown to be beside the Russian leader no less than 35 times in the Black Sea resort Sochi.</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid-19</a> pandemic, the world&#8217;s press kept a close eye on Putin as he met more than once with people who would go on to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11296459/coronavirus-fears-putin-shook-hands-tests-positive/">test positive for the virus</a>.</p>



<p>And he was forced to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16133486/vladimir-putin-self-isolate-covid/">self-isolate in September 2021</a>, after several people close to him went down with the virus.</p>



<p>There has been much speculation about his health over the years, with researchers in 2015 claiming they identified signs in Putin&#8217;s gait which could point to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13125878/does-putin-have-parkinsons-who-replace-resigns/">Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a>. </p>



<p>The team spotted how the Russian had a tendency to keep one arm pinned to his side.</p>



<p>It has also been claimed the President had been<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17931327/putin-roid-rage-cancer-treatment/"> treated for cancer.</a></p>



<p>Political analyst Valery Solovei claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13253481/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">Putin underwent surgery</a>&nbsp;in February 2020 and another Russian source went on to claim it was an abdominal cancer operation.</p>



<p>Solovei also went on to suggest that Putin is suffering from symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>



<h2 id="what-has-the-kremlin-said">What has the Kremlin said?</h2>



<p>It is rare for the Kremlin to comment on Putin&#8217;s health, but it did issue a firm denial of the Parkinson&#8217;s disease claims.</p>

<p>A DISTURBING tale of forbidden love between two incestual siblings shocked the world when they vowed to stay together for their children. </p>



<p>Susan Karolewski was reunited with her older brother Patrick Stuebing 20 years after he escaped their abusive home when he was adopted aged three, in the former East <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/">Germany.</a> </p>



<figure id="attachment_18393345" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729037057.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=600" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18393345" width="600" height="375" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Susan and Patrick were reunited 20 years after he was adopted by another family and fell in love</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<p>But just six months after their biological mother died, the pair, then 16 and 23, described how their fondest for each other turned into a disturbing sexual relationship. </p>



<p>The couple went on to have four children, two of which are severely disabled, with Patrick serving two jail terms after being found guilty of incest. </p>



<p>The pair sparked a media storm when the relationship came to light in 2001 and vowed to challenge Germany&#8217;s incest laws that made sex between siblings illegal. </p>



<p>In 2012 Patrick appealed to the Court of Human Rights in a bid to seal their shocking union by claiming he and Susan had a right to family life. </p>

<p>Patrick was born into a struggling family in 1977 in Leipzig and was one of eight children. </p>



<p>At the age of three, he was fostered after being attacked with a knife by his alcoholic father. </p>

<p>He was adopted by his foster parents aged 7 nearly 100 miles away in the city of Portsdam. </p>



<p>His sister, Susan, was born in 1984 on the day their parent&#8217;s divorce was finalised. </p>



<p>Susan, who is mentally disabled, grew up in the same abusive household her brother had been able to escape and was poorly educated, barely able to read and write. </p>



<p>Some of the six brothers and sisters died after being born with disabilities, while another was run over aged 7. </p>



<h2 id="forbidden-lovers">FORBIDDEN LOVERS </h2>



<p>The pair eventually met in 2000 when Patrick sought out his biological family but their relationship intensified just six months after their mother, Ana Marie, died of a heart attack. </p>



<p>Susan became heavily dependent on her brother and was described by a reporter as being an obsessive nail-biter with a simple way of speaking. </p>



<p>Susan was just 16 when she and Patrick, then 23, first began their disturbing incestual relationships when the siblings started sharing a room. </p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-439288/Forbidden-love-brother-sister.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mail in 2007,</a> he said: &#8220;We both stayed up late into the night to talk to each other about our hopes and dreams. </p>



<p>Susan said: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know each other in childhood, it&#8217;s not the same for us. </p>



<p>&#8220;We fell in love as adults and our love is real. There is nothing we could do about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were both attracted to each other and nature took over from us.   It was that simple. What else could we do? </p>



<p>&#8220;We followed our instinct and our hearts.&#8221; </p>



<p>By October 2001, Susan fell pregnant with her first child and gave birth to a baby boy with severe disabilities, named Erik.  </p>



<p>But a nurse became suspicious and contacted German cops before Patrick received a year&#8217;s suspended jail term for incest and Susan, 17 and still treated as a juvenile, was placed in care. </p>



<p>The pair continued to meet in secret and Susan had three more children, keeping her bump covered with baggy clothes. </p>



<p>A daughter Sarah, who was also born disabled, as well as Nancy and Sophia. </p>



<p>Patrick was jailed for ten months for his second incest conviction and then for a further two and a half years after being convicted for the third time. </p>



<p>The pair denied that their children were born disabled due to their incestuous relationship. </p>



<p>Speaking in 2007, Patrick said: &#8220;Two of our children are disabled but that is not necessarily anything to do with the fact that we are siblings. </p>



<p>&#8220;There are disabled people in our family. We had six brothers and sisters who did not survive in some cases because they were disabled.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="court-appeal">COURT APPEAL </h2>



<p>While Patrick was behind bars Susan told reporters that she could not live without him &#8211; despite conceiving a fifth child with another man.</p>



<p>The mum-of-five however gave up her rights to the child before the baby went to live with its father. </p>



<p>Patrick underwent a vasectomy in 2004 and attempted to change the German law that made incest illegal in a bid to keep himself out of prison. </p>



<p>But in 2008 The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany upheld the law and rejected his appeal. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18393351" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729036649.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18393351" width="640" height="360" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The pair have four children together with two currently in foster care</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>In 2012 Patrick also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that the couple had a right to family life and privacy. </p>



<p>Again the appeal was rejected after the court believed the couple had been treated fairly by German authorities. </p>



<p>The couple often visited son Erik at his foster home and sensationally claimed that had their first child not been taken away, they would not have had any more children. </p>



<p>Patrick said: &#8220;When you see your child being looked after by someone else when they should be with you, that&#8217;s hard for any parent to bear. </p>



<p>&#8220;So if he is handicapped, well, that is all the more reason we should be able to look after him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Talking of his vasectomy he said: &#8220;There is no reason for them to jail me now. I do not want to go back to jail and I know we will never voluntarily leave each other. </p>



<p>&#8220;If anyone doubts our love they should just see we will not be kept apart.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2014 the German Ethics Council made a shocking u-turn and voted in favour of allowing incest between siblings. </p>



<p>They claimed the risk of disability was not enough to warrant the law after reviewing the German couple&#8217;s case. </p>



<p>The law still remains in Germany with incestual relationships between siblings being illegal. </p>

<p>HEARTLESS Michael Jackson would let his guards bludgeon bunnies to death before chucking them to his alligators in front of terrified kids, the star&#8217;s maid has revealed. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-jackson/">King of Pop</a> also allowed his child pals to hurl huge rocks at his terrified lion Kimber, let his elephants be chained by their legs in tiny enclosures – and even encouraged visitors to pet his giraffes even though the animals had previously attacked an adult and a youngster, she said.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18416097" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729060866-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18416097" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>JDMC</figcredit></figure>Jackson&#8217;s former maid Adrian McManus has spoken out about animal cruelty she witnessed at Neverland[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18416126" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2202e6ee-18eb-406d-a47a-0fbfac700c8f.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18416126" width="960" height="626" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The star had a huge collection of exotic animals</figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>



<p>Adrian McManus, 60, who used to be one of Jacko&#8217;s personal maids said it still breaks her heart to think about how the singer&#8217;s animals were treated at his Neverland zoo.</p>



<p>It comes after The Sun revealed how Jackson delighted in watching his kids run riot, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18393607/michael-jackson-neverland-chimps-attacked-kids-molested-maids/">attacking kids and staff.</a></p>



<p>In one sickening incident, McManus said she witnessed guards grab a live bunny, smash its heads on some rocks, then throw it to Jackson’s collection of alligators.</p>



<p>“Michael had a pool built with a secure fence where he housed around four or five alligators,” she said.</p>

<p>“They were huge creatures, about six feet long. The only people ever allowed in were the handlers, but Michael liked to look over the fence to see them being fed.</p>



<p>“During one lunch break I was down there with some of the maids, just looking at the animals. One of Michael’s bodyguards, not an animal handler, just walked into the gated area, carrying a big white rabbit.</p>

<p>“I ran away from that fence immediately and jumped on a golf cart and headed back to the main house. It took me days to get over it. </p>



<p>“Those guys carried guns, frightened many of us and we were afraid of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>McManus, who was the star&#8217;s maid from 1990-1994, said it soon became a regular occurrence and that the twisted ritual would sometimes be carried out in front of Jackson&#8217;s terrified child pals. </p>



<p>“This became quite common with different staff doing similar killings,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2 id="cruel-and-inhumane">&#8216;CRUEL AND INHUMANE&#8217;</h2>



<p>“And it got to a point where Michael heard about this new ritual, probably because some of the kids and maids were upset.</p>



<p>“I was told Michael told the guards: ‘Don’t be doing that when the kids come around’. But it was too late because some of the children had already seen them do that.</p>



<p>“It was not a warning to not behave so despicably, but simply an order to not upset the kids.</p>



<p>“A member of the security team told me that some of the bodyguards were doing the same with rabbits and rats to feed the snakes.</p>



<p>“The treatment was cruel and inhumane.”</p>



<p>McManus also recalls how the elephants, giraffes and lion were<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8590560/michael-jackson-neverland-ranch-rig-paedo-abuse-rooms/"> badly treated too. </a></p>



<h2 id="lion-stoned-by-kids">&#8216;LION STONED BY KIDS&#8217;</h2>



<p>MJ even let his child pals through huge rocks at his terrified lion Kimber.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the most horrible things I saw was how the lion was treated,&#8221; McManus recalls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael would be with the kids, walking them around the enclosures.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the little boys would pick up rocks, the size of tennis balls, and throw them at the cage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many of them were too big to get through the bars, but it rattled them and upset the creature greatly.</p>



<p>&#8220;They were trying to make the lion Kimber roar. But he was more scared and cowered to the back, fearing more attacks.</p>



<p>&#8220;It meant the lion seemed nervous and on edge. Certainly staff were very wary about going near the lion.</p>



<h2 id="animals-drugged">&#8216;ANIMALS DRUGGED&#8217; </h2>



<p>&#8220;Michael saw all this unfold often and never said anything to the kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>When inspectors came, the poor lion was drugged and taken away because Jackson didn&#8217;t have the right permits, McManus alleges.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they knew a visit from The Occupational Safety and Health Administration was coming, they drugged him up and took him away,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Jacko also encouraged kids and visitors to pet giraffes even after they cut a man&#8217;s head open and left a child crying in pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day I went into work and there was chaos in the animal&nbsp;enclosures, because a guest had been hurt by a giraffe,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2 id="giraffe-attacks">&#8216;GIRAFFE ATTACKS&#8217; </h2>



<p>&#8220;I was told the giraffe simply swung his long neck around and its head smashed into a guest&#8217;s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It left him in excruciating pain and had cut open part of his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s injuries were so deep and significant that he needed stitches to repair the damage.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we never learned what happened to him and anyone asking questions would be told to stop. It was all hushed up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Another occasion a giraffe was meeting kids at a family day Michael had laid on&#8230;&nbsp;but one child was knocked to the floor because the creature thought it was some treats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw the kid&#8217;s head struck by the curious giraffe, which sent him falling really hard on the tough turf. He was holding his head and crying in pain.</p>



<h2 id="elephants-in-chains">&#8216;ELEPHANTS IN CHAINS&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;Nothing was done and guests seemed to just brush it off because it was Michael&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>&#8220;That incident never stopped guests being told it was okay to pet or interact with the giraffes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was heartbreaking because those creatures had no idea of how to deal with people, but were treated like circus animals.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heartbreakingly she also saw elephants, chained up by the legs and cruel bullhooks in tiny enclosures </p>



<p>&#8220;I saw elephants in the habitat which seemed very small areas for animals that size. They were close together and had very little room to exercise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time I saw them there their legs were chained up. I saw guys who worked there holding these long metal bars with round hooks, which I believe were bull hooks. </p>

<p>A BRIT martial arts boxer is weathering the fight of his life after smashing his skull and limbs in a horror <strong>motorbike</strong> crash in Thailand.</p>



<p>Christian Richardson, from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/york">York</a>, had recently won his first Muay Thai contest when he was struck down by a lorry on April 13.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18427609" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 617px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729780970.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=607" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18427609" width="607" height="351" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>York Press/Chris Richardson</figcredit></figure>Brit Christian Richardson was hit by a lorry in Thailand[/caption]

<p>The 32-year-old escaped with his life but had several shattered bones and is in hospital after undergoing a number of operations.</p>



<p>He is too ill to fly home to the UK, and his desperate family are trying to raise £60,000 for his treatment.</p>



<p>Sister Emmy Watson says her younger brother &#8220;miraculously didn&#8217;t die or have any brain or spinal injuries&#8221;.</p>



<p>Chris was leaving a coffee shop in <a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/thailand">Thailand</a> when he was hit by a pickup truck, and suffered &#8220;many injuries and broken bones&#8221;.</p>

<p>He was treated at a hospital in Koh Samui for three days before being airlifted to Bangkok.</p>



<p>His heartbroken family say he is unable to transfer to a hospital in the UK as he is battling an infection and needs facial and eye surgery to repair a broken cheekbone and a bad orbital floor fracture.</p>



<p>Emmy says they are on tenterhooks waiting to find out whether his insurance company will fork out for his medical bills &#8211; which she says is &#8220;unlikely&#8221;.</p>



<p>She has started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/chris-motorbike-accident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for his surgery &#8211; with the first two days of treatment costing an eye-watering £25,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;The insurance company has been assessing the case, although we think it unlikely that they will pay, a decision has not been made yet and as a result our family has had to pay out significant sums of money,&#8221; Emmy wrote on the page.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many thanks in advance to anyone who is able to help in any way they can. </p>



<p>&#8220;We need to support our fighter get through this as I know we all want to see him get back to training and having a laugh with us over a pint of Guinness.&#8221;</p>



<p>So far, well-wishers have donated more than £25,000.</p>



<p>Emmy says that if the insurance company covers the costs, all donations will be refunded.</p>



<p>It comes after a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18404049/video-british-tourist-boxer-knife-thief-thailand/">Brit tourist </a>in Thailand was left covered in blood after fighting a knife-wielding boxer who allegedly stole his bag on a beach.</p>



<p>Fraser William Cowen, 23, was paddling in the sea with friends when he saw the thug run off with his belongings in Krabi, southern&nbsp;Thailand, last Sunday.</p>



<p>He sprinted after Suwit Puengsom &#8211; a former professional Muay Thai boxer &#8211; as he was trying to make a getaway on a motorcycle.</p>

<p>THIS is the hilarious moment a sea lion brazenly took a dip in a hotel pool before pinching a bemused guest&#8217;s sunbed as gobsmacked tourists watched on.</p>



<p>Cheeky Wendy and her pup Lulu are regular guests at the exclusive resort in the Galapagos Islands and are known at the hotel for their antics.</p>

<p>Comical footage captured by a holidaymaker shows the cute creature hauling herself up some steps from the sea to the facility&#8217;s outdoor area.</p>



<p>Wendy then invaded the hotel&#8217;s pool &#8211; diving in head first without a second thought.</p>



<p>But after a speedy cruise through the water, the sassy sea lion then sprung out of the water and made a beeline for the only sun lounger sat on by a guest.</p>



<p>The amusing clip shows the confused tourist quickly jumping to his feet as Wendy barges him out the way and nabs his seat.</p>

<p>He can be seen grabbing his towel off the sunbed in a hurry before throwing his arm in the air in confusion as Wendy makes herself comfortable.</p>



<p>Tourists at the hotel are warned about Wendy and are asked to try to stay at least six feet away from the sun lounger stealer.</p>



<p>Guests are also warned to avoid attempting to stroke or feed Wendy and her pup &#8211; who often spend hours sprawled out in the sun on the hotel&#8217;s recliners.</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s a good reason holidaymakers are told to keep their distance, as the slippery sea creatures have a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18314652/worlds-worst-sea-lion-attacks-maul-bite-savage/">troublesome track record of attacking humans</a></p>

<p>The mammals&#8217; dangerous reputation is often overshadowed by more formidable beasts lurking in the ocean and their inclusion in circuses and shows &#8211; meaning they are easily underestimated.</p>



<p>Their curious nature is often mistaken as friendliness by swimmers, with many forgetting their animal instincts will always reign supreme.</p>



<p>Humans are playing an underwater game of Russian roulette by taking a dip into their environment &#8211; no matter how many cute cartoons you may have seen.</p>



<p>Although attacks are rare, coming within 8ft of the beasts can have disastrous consequences.</p>



<p>Their speed, power and unsettling element of surprise make them a terrifying opponent in their underwater territory &#8211; and on land.</p>



<p>One sea lion managed to become an overnight sensation by demonstrating such cunning abilities back in May 2017.</p>



<p>The beast dragged a little girl from behind off a Candian dock in British Columbia in front of horrified holidaymakers.</p>



<p>In another horrifying incident, a 13-year-old girl was mauled by one of the mammals as she frolicked in the ocean in 2019.</p>



<p>Oblivious Megan Pagnini was knee-deep in the ocean at Pismo Beach, California, while her pals filmed her in front of the sunset.</p>



<p>The extraordinary clip shows the sea lion suddenly springing out of the water and attacking the teen as her friends watched in horror.</p>

<p>It managed to tear a deep chunk out of her leg during the terrifying incident &#8211; while changing her opinion of the seemingly cuddly creature.</p>



<p>But animal rights campaigners rushed to the sea lion&#8217;s defence &#8211; reminding people they &#8220;are not circus performers and not trained to be next to people.&#8221;</p>

<p>BRITAIN&#8217;S security services were on high alert on Saturday amid fears Putin&#8217;s army of saboteurs &#8220;could infiltrate the UK to attack key targets&#8221;, it was claimed.</p>



<p>Senior officers at MI5 &#8211; the UK&#8217;s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency &#8211; are said to have warned Home Secretary Priti Patel and her team about the high-level threat from Russia.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chief of Staff Steve Barclay are also understood to have been told of the soaring threat to UK safety which could stem from Russia&#8217;s intelligence service, the FSB.</p>



<p>The fears have now reportedly forced the agency&#8217;s special branch to ramp up the monitoring of all travellers into Britain, sources told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1603708/Putin-Russia-army-saboteurs-Britain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunday Express</a>.</p>



<p>While spooks at GCHQ &#8211;  who provide support and guidance to make the UK safe &#8211; are reportedly liaising with European allies amid the fresh fears, the paper claimed.</p>



<p>The paper says the new plans from the Kremlin are in retaliation for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">Britain&#8217;s relentless support</a> of Ukraine following Russia&#8217;s invasion.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/">threats to the UK</a> could range from “deniable” attacks on vital infrastructure to operations &#8216;intended to humiliate the British government&#8217;.</p>



<p>Kremlin operatives have also allegedly been tasked with reducing public support for the UK Government&#8217;s heroic efforts which are helping Ukraine fight Putin&#8217;s butchers.</p>



<p><strong>It comes as:</strong></p>

<p>Such efforts include the UK sending over 10,000 anti-tank NLAW weapons to Ukraine, which have proven invaluable in holding back Mad Vlad&#8217;s invading forces.</p>



<p>Ukrainian troops have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17936782/ukraine-troops-britain-queen-missile/">hailed the lethal British donations</a>&nbsp;as &#8220;beautiful&#8221; and thanked the Queen for the &#8220;gifts&#8221;.</p>

<p>While the British&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18143261/ukrainian-troops-blast-russian-helicopter-british-missiles/">Starstreak</a>&nbsp;high-velocity missile system has also been seen <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18144176/russia-target-british-weapons-accuses-escalating-war-ukraine/">wreaking havoc</a> on Russian forces.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns of what is to come, a security source told the Sunday Express Russia could now infiltrate the UK and launch attacks.</p>



<p>They said: “There is a serious concern that officers or agents attached to Russia’s security services may attempt to enter the UK and target strategic locations.</p>



<p>“We are well aware of their capabilities and have seen how Putin is using these agencies in Eastern Europe.”</p>



<p>Ed Johnson, head of global intelligence at the Sibylline strategic risk group, told the paper saboteurs see Britain as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18414176/west-prepare-war-russia-nato-putin-cruise-missiles-submarine/">number one target</a>&#8221; and will &#8220;aim to sow chaos, panic or distrust in the Government&#8221;.</p>



<p>He claimed this could range from &#8220;taking down a substation and amplifying the effect through a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/18243853/anonymous-leaks-kremlin-files-claimed-hack/">cyber attack</a>&#8221; to bringing &#8220;hard currency into Britain to&nbsp;finance separatist organisations&#8221;.</p>



<p>MP&#8217;s, agents and officials could also be targets for funding while Russian operatives could even be tasked with releasing &#8220;embarrassing documents&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said Russia’s FSB intelligence service “now has a lot to prove” after providing shoddy pre-invasion intelligence which led to Russia&#8217;s catastrophic miscalculation of Ukrainian resistance.</p>



<h2 id="troll-attacks">TROLL ATTACKS</h2>



<p>The claims follow a massive new disinformation campaign launched by Russia which threatens to further destabilise Britain.</p>



<p>Legions of sinister online Russian trolls are expected to amplify prevalent social media accounts that are &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; to Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>It has been claimed trolls will do this by boosting followers and sharing their content &#8211; all the while keeping within the rules of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>



<p>It comes as research funded by the British Government suggests a wave of recent cyberattacks is likely linked to troll farms in St Petersburg.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office believe one facility &#8211; located in a former factory &#8211; is funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka &#8216;Putin&#8217;s Chef&#8217;.</p>



<p>Prigozhin is the founder of Russian bot-farm the Internet Research Agency.</p>



<p>A source close to the research told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/30/russian-troll-farm-accused-recruiting-regular-internet-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a> that on 23 occasions the factory ordered its trolls to the Twitter and Instagram accounts of politicians including Boris Johnson and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. </p>



<p>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss along with British news websites were also targeted.</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the findings, Ms Truss said: “We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin’s war.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added how the Government will continue to &#8220;work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations”.</p>



<p>The Sun Online have approached the Home Office and Foreign Office for comment.</p>



<p>Back in 2018, Russian spies managed to sneak into the UK and launch the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6693507/novichok-poisoning-salisbury-dawn-sturgess-suspects-latest-russian/">Salisbury attack</a>.</p>

<p><strong>VLADIMIR Putin was last night on the verge of declaring all-out war on Ukraine as he prepares to mobilise more forces to step up his merciless assault.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">The Russian president</a> has previously referred to the invasion only as a “special military operation”.</p>

<p>But he is now expected to openly use the word “war” and unleash fresh hell on civilians already pounded by indiscriminate bombing.</p>



<p>Military sources said he was planning to use his country’s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14650081/russias-tanks-missiles-victory-day-parade/">Victory Day Parade</a> in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18390888/how-kremlin-tightly-controls-putin-hide-ill-health/">Red Square</a> on May 9 to announce mass-mobilisation, enabling him to call up more men to fight.</p>

<p>As a result, Putin is under growing pressure from generals to unleash an all-out war, with fears growing he will respond with renewed brutality.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> top brass are furious about their humiliating defeat around Kyiv and they blame puffy-faced Putin — who is rumoured to be sick — for putting constraints on operations.</p>



<p>They want permission to blitz more targets in Ukraine, including high-profile government buildings.</p>



<p>Defence Secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15963472/who-is-defence-secretary-ben-wallace/">Ben Wallace</a> said he expected Putin to use his May 9 address to declare “war with the world’s Nazis”.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace told LBC: “He is probably going to declare on May Day that, ‘We are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass-mobilise the Russian people’.</p>



<p>“Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. We have to help Ukrainians and keep the momentum pushing them back.”</p>



<p>Declaring war would let Moscow mobilise fighting-age men to replenish their damaging battlefield losses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> claims it has killed more than 23,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no-longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ministry-of-defence/">The Ministry of Defence</a> said Russia had been “forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in north-east Ukraine”. </p>



<p>It added; “Many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale.”</p>



<p>Ukraine’s President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> said Russian troops were turning the Donbas region “into ruins”.</p>



<p>He said: “In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area.</p>



<p>“Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited.</p>



<p>“Absolutely everything is being decided in this war.”</p>



<p>He warned if Russia succeeded in Donbas it would become like <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18424500/horror-conditions-civilians-kids-mariupol-bunker/">Mariupol</a>, which he called a “concentration camp in the middle of ruins”.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8912206/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky/">Mr Zelensky</a> said the Russians were worse than the Nazis, who occupied eastern Europe 80 years ago, because they were lying about their atrocities.</p>



<p>Hopes of finding a way to evacuate civilians have been dashed day after day, as Russia insists the only way to leave is into Russian territory.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18361839/vladimir-putin-troops-reveal-mission/">Putin’s troops</a> have also established so-called filtration camps where civilians trying to flee are checked to see if they have served in the government, police or military.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the bodies of three more men were discovered in a pit in liberated <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18406214/inside-butchers-bucha-russian-soldiers-named-pictured/">Bucha</a>, near Kyiv.</p>



<p>Officials said their hands and feet had been tied and there was evidence of torture.</p>



<p>A residential area was seen lying in smoking ruins yesterday following Russian bombardment.</p>



<p>Aerial photographs show apartment blocks and homes destroyed, some still smouldering and blackened by fire, at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18342493/ukrainian-girl-told-too-ugly-to-rape-russian-soldiers/">Irpin</a> on the outskirts of Kyiv.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a Russian missile struck the airport in Odesa, while <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> said its armed forces had hit 17 Ukrainian military facilities yesterday.</p>

<p>THIS is the moment Hollywood star Angelina Jolie was bundled to the safety of a bunker as sirens rang out in war-torn Ukraine.</p>



<p>In defiance of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>’s threats to unleash World War Three, the film favourite visited Lviv &#8211; where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18296999/boy-three-wounded-russian-shelling-lviv/">seven people were killed in a horror missile strike</a> last week.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/angelina-jolie/">Jolie</a> is the biggest Hollywood star to step foot inside the bomb-blitzed country in the latest sign of the world’s support.</p>



<p>She met refugees who had fled devastated Donbas where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> troops launched an all-out assault after their defeat at Kyiv.</p>



<p>The UN goodwill ambassador was also spotted in a coffee shop in Lviv in western <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine">Ukraine.</a></p>



<p>And footage has emerged of the star and her entourage being briskly escorted to safety as sirens blared out across the city.</p>

<p>Jolie can be heard insisting &#8220;I&#8217;m okay&#8221; as she waved to the camera.</p>



<p>Her visit to Ukraine will likely enrage the Kremlin after Putin’s right-hand man complained that Western aid to Kyiv amounted to a “proxy war” that could trigger nuclear Armageddon.</p>



<p>She travelled independently with her pal Baroness Arminka Helić – who campaigns against rape as a weapon of war. She was not on an official UN mission.</p>



<p>Dressed in a plain grey tracksuit she signed autographs for locals who thanked her for standing with them in their country&#8217;s darkest hour.</p>

<p>Footage of her coffee shop visit sparked jokes across Ukraine – as it showed a youngster at the next door table engrossed in his mobile phone who did not realise she was there.</p>



<p>Eyewitness Maya Pidhoretska wrote on Facebook: &#8220;Nothing special. Just Lviv. I just went to have coffee. Just Angelina Jolie.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lviv had been considered a safe haven for refugees fleeing to Poland &#8211; about 70km away from its border &#8211; but has come under fire in recent weeks.</p>



<p>The star also visited children undergoing treatment at a Lviv hospital for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April.</p>



<p>The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.</p>



<p>Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram: &#8220;She was very moved by (the childrens) stories.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Jolie went to Lviv’s railway station to meet families evacuating from Pokrovsk, a city in eastern Donetsk which has been blitzed by Russian strikes.</p>



<p>During the visit to the station, Jolie met volunteers working with the displaced, who told her that each of the psychiatrists on duty spoke to about 15 people a day. </p>



<p>Many of those in the station are children aged from two to ten, according to volunteers.</p>



<p>&#8220;They must be in shock &#8230; I know how trauma affects children, I know just having somebody show how much they matter, how much their voices matter, I know how healing that is for them,&#8221; she said in reply.</p>

<p>Jolie also visited an orphanage, a rehabilitation centre and aid distribution point.</p>



<p>The 46-year-old is a special envoy for the United Nations refugee agency, which says more than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in the past two months &#8211; which represents around 30 per cent of Ukraine&#8217;s pre-war population.</p>

<p>TERRIFIED civilians including dozens of kids remain trapped in horror conditions beneath a steel plant as brave Ukrainians stage a final stand against Russia in the besieged city of Mariupol.</p>



<p>Horrifying footage shared by solidiers <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18283107/ukrainian-defenders-mariupol-tunnels-steelworks-russians/">holed up in a bunker under the Azovstal iron and steel works</a> &#8211; the port city&#8217;s last remaining holdout &#8211; shows mums and tots among those desperately waiting to be evacuated.</p>

<p>Mariupol has been battered by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> troops ever since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> ordered his troops into Ukraine in February &#8211;&nbsp;with large parts of the city reduced to rubble by constant air and artillery pounding.</p>



<p>Troops defending Ukraine from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian&nbsp;</a>36th Marine Brigade and the Azov Battalion are using tunnels underneath the steelworks to make a last stand against the Russians.</p>



<p>The plant has become the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18353693/brit-fighters-trapped-mariupol/">final refuge for hundreds of Ukrainians in Mariupol</a> &#8211; including 60 children, according to Commander of Ukraine&#8217;s 36th Separate Marine Brigade Major Serhiy Volyna&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as the hero Ukrainian troops cling on to the final piece of Mariupol, the United Nations has been frantically brokering a civilian evacuation from the last Ukrainian stronghold in the bombed-out ruins of the city.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s estimated around 100,000 civilians remain in the city &#8211; with 1,000 living beneath the sprawling Soviet-era steel plant, according to Ukrainian officials, as food and supplies run out. </p>



<p>Ukraine has not said how many fighters also are in the plant, the only part of Mariupol not occupied by Russian forces, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000.</p>



<p>Graphic videos and images shared from inside the plant purport to show&nbsp;kids holed up there while injured men need stained bandages changed as others have open wounds or amputated limbs.</p>



<p>A skeleton medical staff was treating at least 600 wounded people, two Ukrainian women who said their husbands are among the fighters refusing to surrender there told Associated Press.</p>

<p>Some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene, they said.</p>



<p>According to reports, some kids at the steel plant are losing their hair and teeth because of stress after watching their parents be killed.</p>



<p>A woman identified only as Viktoria told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/low-supplies-and-dirty-bandages-inside-the-living-hell-of-mariupols-azovstal-steel-plant-vkdccklh9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times</a> she has spoken to her brother, a national guard soldier sheltering in Azovstal, who has told her there are &#8220;many elderly and children&#8221; at the plant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some (children) are losing hair and teeth,&#8221; she said, adding that some have grown grey hairs and are starting to stutter.</p>



<p>But with stacks of rubble as a result of constant attacks, some cellars and bunkers at the plant are now feared unreachable &#8211; leaving innocent children trapped.</p>



<p>Russians have control of all of the city except the plant as fighting continues around it, with almost no phone service, electricity or internet access.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s reported at least 20 women and children were evacuated from the plant today,  including six children under the age of 14 &#8211; the first group able to leave since Putin ordered the plant be sealed off last week.</p>



<p>The facility has a series of bunkers underneath it, dating from the Cold War when they were built to protect its workers from nuclear attack.</p>



<p>The highly secure, maze-like bunkers are thought to contain around 1,500 Ukrainian troops and go six storeys underground.</p>



<p>It comes as Putin&#8217;s furious army chiefs have <a href="http://thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">urged him to launch an all-out war on Ukraine</a> as &#8220;payback&#8221; over the shambolic invasion, officials have warned.</p>



<p>Russia&nbsp;had expected it could march across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>&nbsp;without much of a fight when troops invaded for a &#8220;special operation&#8221; in February &#8211; but they have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance</a>&nbsp;and weeks of fighting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;army chiefs have become increasingly frustrated with the scaled-down offensive in eastern Ukraine and his handling of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a>&nbsp;&#8211; with a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; exploding in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a>.</p>

<p>Military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>



<p>An all-out war would allow Moscow to draft in more conscripts, impose martial law and also bid for support from its international allies &#8211; such as Belarus.</p>

<p>A BRAVE mum waited seven hours to be brought to safety after she was bitten by Australia&#8217;s most venomous snake while hiking in a remote gorge.</p>



<p>Megan Brouwer, 36, was with her husband and five-year-old son when the venomous serpent lunged at her in the Karijini National Park &#8211; located 300km from the nearest town. </p>

<p>It took seven hours for rescue workers and emergency services to lift her from the bottom of one of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">West Australia&#8217;s</a> steepest gorges and bring her to safety.</p>



<p>The family had just started their return hike in the picturesque Knox Gorge when Ms Brouwer&#8217;s husband yelled &#8220;snake&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just knew in the way that he yelled it that it was either on me or very close to me,&#8221; she told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-29/karijini-knox-gorge-western-brown-snake-bite-rescue/101027146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;So I jumped around frantically for a moment then saw it in the corner of my eye, slithering away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she looked down at her legs and saw blood and a puncture wound from the brown snake. </p>



<p>Luckily, an off-duty doctor was nearby and applied a bandage to the wound.</p>



<p>The doctor, who had a first aid kit to hand and a satellite phone, managed to raise the alarm with the emergency services.</p>



<p>Ms Brouwer said: &#8220;[The off-duty doctor] had a pressure bandage and applied that for me. </p>

<p>&#8220;She also had a satellite phone in hand… but unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t connecting, we were so far in the gorge.</p>



<p>&#8220;So she then ran to the top of the gorge &#8211; which took her about an hour or so.&#8221;</p>



<p>It took Karijini rangers, local police, State Emergency Service, and St John Ambulance volunteers a mammoth seven hours to bring Ms Brouwer and her family to safety at the nearest hospital.</p>



<p>She was taken across three pools of water while strapped on a stretcher before she was lifted up to a narrow path lined with dozens of loose rocks.</p>



<p>The mum said the exit route was &#8220;pretty hairy&#8221; at times and the whole experience was &#8220;like something I&#8217;d never experienced before&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;The path itself got quite narrow at the edge of the cliff, and manoeuvring a stretcher around trees and up the cliff face was pretty scary for me,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There were also some unexpected things like wasps nests and lots of loose rock so footing was really, really important.&#8221;</p>



<p>Luckily Ms Brouwer had received a &#8220;dry bite&#8221; from the highly poisonous snake.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve since learned that if he had got me a second time maybe that would have been a poisonous bite.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m all good. I know a lot more about snakes and I know how best to be prepared when you&#8217;re hiking in very remote parts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ms Brouwer thanked the rescue team for their efforts.</p>

<p>A CONTRACTOR thought he had hit the jackpot when he found a whopping £150,000 hidden behind a bathroom wall &#8211; but it ended up being a nightmare. </p>



<p>Bob Kitts was renovating the bathroom of an old home near Lake Erie, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/cleveland/">Cleveland</a> when he found two green locked boxes suspended by a wire below the medicine cabinet.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18423566" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729686079.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18423566" width="960" height="695" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Bob Kitts and homeowner Amanda Reece pose with the money found in the wall[/caption]



<p>Inside he found envelopes with a return address for the P. Dunne News Agency.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ripped the corner off of one,&#8221; Mr Kitts said in a deposition in a lawsuit filed by Mr Dunne’s estate, according to the New York Times.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw a 50 and got a little dizzy.”</p>



<p>It turns out the envelopes contained £124,000 and a cardboard box had another £26,000. </p>

<p>But the discovery of the rare late-1920s bills turned into a living nightmare for Mr Kitts as he and the homeowner, Amanda Reece, couldn&#8217;t decide on how to split the money. </p>



<p>She offered to give him 10 per cent of the cash, but he wanted 40 per cent &#8211; and things soon became difficult. </p>



<p>The Dunne estate also later sued, with 21 heirs claiming the rights to the money.</p>



<p>Yet there wasn&#8217;t much left to claim. </p>

<p>Ms Reece testified she had spent about £11,000 on a luxury trip to Hawaii with her mum and she had also sold some of the bills on eBay and to a coin dealer.</p>



<p>She also claimed about £47,000 was stolen from a shoe box in her wardrobe &#8211; although she said she never reported the incident to the cops.</p>



<p>Things became even worse after Mr Kitts said Ms Reece accused him of stealing the money.</p>



<p>She allegedly started leaving him threatening phone messages as the situation turned nasty. </p>



<p>Finally, Ms Reece dropped her claim to the remaining £20,000 and the courts gave Mr Kitts 13.7 per cent and the rest to Mr Dunne’s 21 heirs.</p>



<p>Cuyahoga County probate magistrate, Charles Brown, said the cash in the envelopes belonged to the heirs as they were labelled with Mr Dunne&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>And he said the cash in the cardboard box should belong to Ms Reece as the homeowner &#8211; but she dropped her claim, so Mr Kitts could take the money as he found it.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->
	<blockquote class="article__quote">

				<cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color">
					<span class="quote-credit">Bob Kitts</span>				</cite>
					</div>
	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>Ms Reece, a mortgage loan officer, testified in a deposition that she had been struggling with debt problems at the time.</p>



<p>Gid Marcinkevicius, a lawyer who represented the Dunne estate, said: “I called it the greed case.</p>



<p>&#8220;If these two individuals had sat down and resolved their disputes and divided the money, the heirs would have had no knowledge of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because they were not able to sit down and divide it in a rational way, they both lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Kitts claimed he lost a lot of business at the time because he was portrayed as greedy.</p>



<p>“I was not the bad guy that everybody made me out to be,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t do anything wrong. It was a neat experience, something that won&#8217;t happen again.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that regard, it was pretty fascinating; seeing that amount of money in front of you was breathtaking. </p>

<p>But now it has been reported that 69-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin </a>could soon vanish as he goes under the knife, with power transferred to Nikolai Patrushev.</p>



<p>Shadowy Patrushev, 70, is seen as a key architect of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine war</a> strategy and the man who convinced Putin that Kyiv was awash with neo-Nazis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The claim was reported on Russian media outlet General SVR, which first raised issues of Putin’s health around 18-months ago.</p>



<p>They quote an anonymous former high-ranking Kremlin military figure as saying: “Putin has discussed that he will be undergoing medical procedures.”</p>

<p>“He will have surgery and while he is incapacitated,” he says, adding that he “thinks it&#8217;ll be for a short time”.</p>



<p>The source said the choice of spymaster Patrushev, which came after a two-hour “heart to heart” with Putin, was the “worst option”.</p>



<p>He went on to speculate that Putin’s health problems could deteriorate.</p>

<p>“What if, all of a sudden, Putin manifests particularly severe health problems?,” he said.</p>



<p>“We know very well that he has cancer, and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, as we have said many times.</p>



<p>“It was possible to contain it for some time, but now the course of the disease is progressing.”</p>



<p>When exactly Putin will go into hospital is unclear but it is unlikely to before May 9, when he presides over the grandiose Red Victory Day commemoration of the defeat of Hitler.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">UK&#8217;s Defence Secretary&nbsp;Ben Wallace&nbsp;warned </a>Putin could use the day to announce the mobilisation of his reserves for a final push in Ukraine.</p>



<p>He told LBC: &#8220;He is probably going to declare… that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got…and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.”</p>



<p>It comes as military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>



<p>An all-out war would allow Moscow to draft in more conscripts, impose martial law and also bid for support from its international allies &#8211; such as Belarus.</p>

<p>THIS is the dramatic moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike as Vladimir Putin loses more than 23,000 troops.</p>



<p>Striking footage showed the devastation caused by the strike from what was believed to be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a> 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>

<p>In the clip the drone hangs in the air as it appears to eye up its <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> targets &#8211; understood to be Kurganets-25 tanks.</p>



<p>It then drops the bombs, plummeting towards the oblivious war machine before a strike rips apart the tank in a massive inferno.</p>



<p>It is unclear where the attack took place.</p>



<p>The shocking footage of the strike was shared online by the editor of the OSINT Bunker Podcast.</p>

<p>The humiliating scenes come as Putin&#8217;s troop losses now amount to more than 23,200, <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/general-staff-23000-russian-troops-killed-in-ukraine-since-feb-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyiv Independent</a> reports.</p>



<p>According to the figures, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> has also lost more than 1,000 tanks and 190 planes.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Britain&#8217;s Defence Secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15963472/who-is-defence-secretary-ben-wallace/">Ben Wallace</a> estimated some 15,000 Russian troops have been killed.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace said: &#8220;This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles.</p>



<p>&#8220;Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted Russia has suffered &#8220;significant losses of troops&#8221; &#8211; calling it &#8220;a huge tragedy for us&#8221;.</p>



<p>After failing to capture Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has turned cities to rubble and killed thousands, Russia is now focusing on the east and south of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Russian troops continued to pound Ukraine&#8217;s eastern Donbas region on Saturday &#8211; but failed to capture three target areas, Ukraine&#8217;s military said.</p>



<p>The Russians were trying to capture the areas of Lyman in Donetsk and Sievierodonetsk and Popasna in Luhansk, the General Staff of Ukraine&#8217;s Armed Forces said in a daily update. </p>



<p>&#8220;Not succeeding &#8211; the fighting continues,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>Moscow hopes to take full control of the eastern Donbas region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk &#8211; parts of which were already controlled by Russian-backed separatists before the invasion.</p>



<p>Russia claimed its troops had struck 389 Ukrainian targets overnight on Friday.</p>



<p>Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, saud Russians were shelling the entire region &#8220;but they cannot get through our defence&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A senior US defence official said Moscow&#8217;s offensive is going much slower than planned.</p>



<p>The official believes the Russians are at least several days behind where they wanted to be as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east.</p>



<p>&#8220;As Russian troops try to move north out of the bombed-out city of Mariupol so they can advance on Ukrainian forces from the south, their progress has been slow and uneven and certainly not decisive,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence also said Russian forces are likely to be suffering from &#8220;weakened morale, along with a lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Russian forces have been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in northeast Ukraine,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>RUSSIA&#8217;S lethal anti-tank mine which can blast 100ft in the air and fire explosives from above has been seen in Ukraine for the first time.</p>



<p>The so-called &#8220;smart-mine&#8221;, which is triggered when its target gets within 100m, has never been used on the battlefield before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&#8216;s PTKM-1R top-attack mine launches itself into the air, scanning the ground for its target, and then firing an explosive slug from above.</p>



<p>Armoured vehicle turrets have thinner plating, making them more vulnerable to attack.</p>



<p>The mine, which is believed to have been introduced into service by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a>&#8216;s army in 2020, is similar to the US M-93 &#8220;Hornet&#8221; wide-area munition.</p>



<p>It was reportedly discovered in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> on April 26, in the latest sign of further military escalation in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">conflict</a> there, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/29/russia-military-anti-tank-weapons-mines-deployed-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>.</p>

<p>The mine contains sensors that listen for the sound of approaching vehicles, interpreting the vibrations to detect whether or not a tank is rolling by.</p>



<p>In theory, the mine is intelligent enough to distinguish between tanks and other vehicles, ignoring civilian cars and less important military hardware.</p>



<p>A picture was shared on Twitter of one of the mines placed in a field in Ukraine, reportedly taken three days ago.</p>



<p>The mine is placed on the ground facing upwards with its eight legs folded outwards, according to the <a href="https://armamentresearch.com/russian-ptkm-1r-top-attack-anti-vehicle-mine-documented-in-ukraine-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Armament Research Services</a> blog.</p>

<p>Four directional acoustic sensors and seismic sensors are set off when the target vehicle comes within 100m.</p>



<p>At this point, the projectile&#8217;s flight path is calculated, and onboard systems put the target in their sights.</p>



<p>The mine then tilts down at a 30-degree angle towards the tank.</p>



<p>When it gets close enough, a 6.2lb explosive warhead is launched around 100ft into the air, as the mine&#8217;s infrared censors scan the ground below for the tank.</p>



<p>An explosive metal projectile is fired from the warhead at such high speeds that it can penetrate 7cm (almost three inches) of steel armour.</p>



<p>This whole launch process takes just a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Tank armour has improved greatly in recent years and is often made from lighter ceramic alternatives to the traditional steel plating.</p>



<p>This means they are far more manoeuvrable while still protecting the crew inside.</p>



<p>Weapons developers have, therefore, tried to create a new generation of high-tech anti-tank weapons which strike from above, targeting the weaker turrets.</p>

<p>In November last year, the Russian military posted a video on YouTube, demonstrating the PTKM-1R&#8217;s power.</p>



<p>Slow-motion footage captures the moment it strikes an unmanned tank, hanging in the air for a split second before firing down at its target.</p>



<p>It isn&#8217;t known if the weapon has been used to destroy any Ukrainian tanks so far.</p>



<p>The country has become a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18123507/russian-tanks-annihilated-driver-runs/">graveyard for Russian tanks</a>, and Ukraine&#8217;s military estimates that as of Friday, 986 have been destroyed since the start of the war.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18046624/britain-ukraine-anti-tank-missiles/">Britain has sent thousands of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine</a>, greatly aiding the war effort.</p>



<p>The Next-generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon, or NLAW, is just a metre long, making it easy to carry on the battlefield.</p>



<p>It has a range of up to 800m and can penetrate armour more than 500m away, despite its relatively low cost of just £20,000 each.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, drone footage captured the moment an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">entire Russian tank column was obliterated</a>.</p>



<p>Troops from the Ukrainian 54th Mechanized Brigade reportedly targeted the terrifying column of tanks with UAV corrected artillery.</p>



<p>They destroyed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a>&nbsp;convoy in just a matter of minutes with a series of devastating strikes from hundreds of feet in the air.</p>



<p>Incredible footage shows the combat vehicles being taken out one by one in Donetsk &#8211; reportedly forcing any surviving soldiers to withdraw.</p>



<p>The tanks exploded into fireballs, leaving the narrow country road littered with scraps of the vehicles.</p>

<p>It comes as a former Nato chief warned that the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18414176/west-prepare-war-russia-nato-putin-cruise-missiles-submarine/">West must &#8220;prepare for war with Russia,&#8221;</a> sparking fresh fears of a global conflict.</p>



<p>Russia released a propaganda video on Friday of a submarine launching a volley of cruise missiles from under the Black Sea at Ukrainian targets.</p>



<p>Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy strategic commander for Europe, told&nbsp;BBC Radio 4’s Today program&nbsp;the Kremlin was likely to respond aggressively but assisting Ukraine was still the &#8220;right approach&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;The worst case is war with Russia.</p>



<p>&#8220;By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin himself darkly warned he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">could use nuclear weapons against the UK and European allies</a>&nbsp;in a speech earlier this week.</p>



<p>Today Russian state TV broadcast a chilling map claiming to show how fast a Sarmat ICBM could strike from the Kaliningrad enclave in the Baltic.</p>



<p>It gleefully warns Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin&#8217;s</a> army chiefs have become increasingly frustrated with the scaled-down offensive in eastern Ukraine and his handling of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a>&nbsp;&#8211; with a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; exploding in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a>.</p>



<p>Military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>



<p>An all-out war would allow Moscow to draft in more conscripts, impose martial law and also bid for support from its international allies &#8211; such as Belarus.</p>



<p>A source close to Russian military chiefs told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/29/vladimir-putin-poised-declare-all-out-war-ukraine-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>: &#8220;The military are outraged that the blitz on Kyiv failed.</p>

<p>“People in the army are seeking payback for failures of the past, and they want to go further in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The UK&#8217;s Defence Secretary&nbsp;Ben Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408151/putin-world-war-three-within-days/">warned Putin could use Russia&#8217;s victory day parade on May 9</a> to announce the mobilisation of his reserves for a final push in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told LBC: &#8220;He is probably going to declare… that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got.. and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. </p>

<p>&#8220;We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.&#8221;</p>



<p>And ex-Nato chief&nbsp;Richard Sherriff warned the West must &#8220;gear itself up&#8221; for a &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; with Russia in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The editor of the state-owned broadcaster RT Margarita Simonyan said it was “more probable” that Putin would launch a nuclear strike than allow&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;to lose the war.</p>



<p>Mr Sherriff told BBC Radio 4: &#8220;The worst case is war with Russia. By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s top generals are already <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398930/vladimir-putin-generals-ukraine-war-disaster-coup/">said to be turning on the tyrant</a> over the invasion as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18141050/vladimir-putin-ousted-two-years/">fears of a military coup</a> mount.</p>



<p>The powerful Russian &#8220;siloviki&#8221; &#8211; or security bloc &#8211;&nbsp;have reportedly blamed Putin for a &#8220;serious error&#8221; after retreating from the capital of Kyiv and concentrating on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">taking control of the Donbas in the east</a>.</p>



<p>Thousands more Russian troops have poured into eastern Ukraine &#8211; but they are making limited advances.</p>



<p>Putin’s military chief General Valery Gerasimov is now thought to be heading to the frontline to inject &#8220;momentum&#8221; and &#8220;authority&#8221; into the struggling troops.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are credible reports that he is going to go forward,” one western official reportedly said.</p>



<p>&#8220;In overall terms, it does show the continuing command and control challenges that the Russians are having.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="dwarves-in-the-kremlin">&#8216;DWARVES IN THE KREMLIN&#8217;</h2>



<p>Igor Girkin, a retired military intelligence officer who led separatist forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has slammed Moscow&#8217;s &#8220;failures&#8221; in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In a post online, he said: &#8220;What else has to happen before the dwarves in the Kremlin realise they are in an all-out, harsh war and start to act accordingly?&#8221;</p>



<p>And Alexander Arutyunov, a retired Russian commando and usually a pro-Kremlin blogger, said: &#8220;Vladimir Vladimirovich, can you please make up your mind: are we fighting or are we playing around?&#8221;</p>



<p>The ex-military intelligence commander&nbsp;said: “Strike them all over, completely destroy all their aerodromes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Turn them into Moon craters so that not a single plane with a Bayraktar [military drone] can take off.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must destroy all their railway lines with missiles of such big size that they spend years&nbsp;repairing&nbsp;them…</p>



<p>&#8220;If I understand it, why don’t your top guys get it? This is beyond me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Russia analyst&nbsp;Alexey Muraviev has previously warned that Putin faces a&nbsp;potential coup&nbsp;from within his military and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Mr Muraviev told Sky News Australia that the coup may come as they want to try and win the war &#8211; not to stop aggression in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;I think that there have been tensions between Russia and the intelligence community and Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because clearly, there&#8217;s been a clear error of judgment that was made and it was probably driven by Putin himself about the situation in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;About the initial planning and the initial phase of the invasion where the Russian military naturally assume that they&#8217;re going there as liberators rather than the invaders.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that sort of false narrative was presented to them by the Supreme Commander in Chief, and when it fired back when the Russians began taking heavy casualties, Putin began quietly blaming the security services.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which I don&#8217;t think went really well also because he&#8217;s coming from within the security apparatus.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes as Britain announced it is sending around 8,000 of its troops &#8211; the largest deployment in Europe since the Cold War &#8211; to take part in exercises across eastern Europe this summer.</p>



<p>British troops will be joined by tens of thousands of troops from Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance.</p>

<p>CALLOUS Michael Jackson rejected his once devoted chimp Bubbles because &#8220;he got too old &#8211; just like his child pals&#8221; causing the heartbroken animal to attempt suicide, The Sun can reveal.</p>



<p>In an exclusive interview, Adrian McManus, 60, who was one of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-jackson/">King of Pop&#8217;s</a> personal maids, has lifted the lids on the horrifying abuse of the animals at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18389129/what-happened-michael-jackson-neverland/">Neverland ranch</a> in California &#8211; claiming chimps were left to run wild and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18393607/michael-jackson-neverland-chimps-attacked-kids-molested-maids/">often attacked children and staff.</a></p>



<figure id="attachment_18415186" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 729px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d66034b-a4a8-4fe2-a597-92a96dcc414a.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=719" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18415186" width="719" height="837" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">MJ is alleged to have rejected Bubbles when got too old</figcaption><figcredit>SIPA - Rex Features</figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_undefined" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 10px"><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475392964.jpg?strip=all" alt=" Bubbles clutches a publicity photograph of him and Michael" class="alignnone" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bubbles clutches a publicity photograph of him and Michael</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Bubbles was believed to be Jacko&#8217;s number one pet, who he treated as his own child, but McManus says Bubbles had been kicked out by the star before she started working for him in 1990. </p>



<p>Despite declaring his love for Bubbles to the world &#8211; even taking him on tour with him and teaching him his famous Moonwalk dance  &#8211; McManus said Jacko never spoke about him and didn&#8217;t even have a picture of him.  </p>



<p>Chillingly she likened his treatment of the lovable chimp to the way he treated the children in his life &#8211; who he would lavish with gifts and attention before ditching them when they grew older.</p>



<p>McManus said Bubbles was abandoned in favour of his younger chimp Max.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bubbles was not in the house or with Michael by the time I started cleaning his room,&#8221; McManus told The Sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;There were no photos of Michael and Bubbles in the rooms I cleaned. Honestly I cannot recall Michael talking in depth about him. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was only when I asked and he never told me where Bubbles was.</p>



<p>&#8220;By then he had moved onto Max. It was a bit like the little boys in his life, when they grew too old they would be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>McManus said that the star confided in her that Bubbles had become dangerous &#8211; and claimed the chimp was as strong as 35 men.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael told me that Bubbles was too dangerous to have in his house as he was now a teenager and could not be easily controlled,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;He told me &#8216;Adrian, Bubbles has the strength of 35 men, so if anything goes wrong it could be dangerous.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Interestingly I do recall the personnel manager saying that all the staff had insurance policies for hand injuries on site.</p>

	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>&#8220;The suggestion was that there was coverage for anyone being bitten by the animals. I do not know whether that was because something had happened in the past, but it would not surprise me.</p>



<p>&#8220;If Bubbles was as wild and strong as Michael said, and had free rein like Max I could not imagine what could have happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bubbles now spends his life in a retirement home in Florida after allegedly attempting suicide amid the claims he suffered abuse while living with the King of Pop.</p>



<p>The Jackson family has strongly denied Michael abused Bubbles.</p>



<h2 id="suicide-bid">SUICIDE BID</h2>



<p>However the depressed chimp tried to take his own life after he left Jackson&#8217;s zoo of horrors. </p>



<p>He is alleged to have been saved by medics — but no further details of the alleged incident have ever been revealed.</p>



<p>Now 38, which is late-middle-aged in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15672152/worlds-most-horrific-chimp-attacks/">chimpanzee</a> terms, Bubbles is holed up in the Center for Great Apes in Florida — which acts retirement home for famous chimps and orangutans.</p>



<p>This is a far cry from his life with Jacko where he was constantly under the media spotlight.</p>



<p>Tellingly, these days Bubbles will often turn his back when he sees a camera, despite having been the most photographed chimp in the world.</p>



<p>McManus says she attacked twice by Jackson&#8217;s animals, once by Max the chimp and once by Jacko&#8217;s Brandy and Patrick. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18413794" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 747px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1a15063d-08d7-4416-a654-c6512b7dc44c.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=737" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18413794" width="737" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bubbles the chimp now at his new home &#8211; a sanctuary in Florida</figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>



<p>But rather than blame the animals, she points the finger firmly at mad Jackson for thinking he was a &#8220;real life Doctor Doolittle&#8221;</p>



<p>She said all the animals including elephants, giraffes and chimps were untrained and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8590560/michael-jackson-neverland-ranch-rig-paedo-abuse-rooms/">badly treated</a> &#8211; with many dying or just disappearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael said he was an animal lover, but many animals were poorly treated,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The zoo should not have been there because no-one ever really properly looked after the animals and all of the staff were in danger. I am shocked no-one got seriously injured or attacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michael should never have been allowed to have kept those animals.</p>



<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart to think about all the cruelty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Animals died and disappeared all the time at Neverland, but unusually it was considered normal.</p>



<p>&#8220;No-one seemed to investigate or ask questions. </p>



<p>&#8220;Animal encounters going wrong would be treated like a joke and gossip by staff, rather than actually serious concerns.&#8221;</p>

<p>RUSSIAN soldiers have been complaining bitterly about their shoddy equipment, including flimsy helmets and useless first-aid kids.</p>



<p>In a viral video, a soldier crushes a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> helmet with just his foot to show how poor quality they are.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18199648/rusich-neo-nazi-mercenaries-collect-ears/">mercenaries</a> have also shared pictures of their inferior first-aid kits alongside the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> one, to show the contrast in equipment.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian kit seems to contain a number of tools, including scissors, an intubation tube to help someone breathe with a blocked airway, and much more.</p>



<p>In contrast, Russian troops have been sent to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war</a> with a kit appearing to contain nothing more than several instruction manuals and something to tie off a tourniquet.</p>



<p>Russian mercenaries who allegedly posted the picture on social media complained: &#8220;This is what Putin and Shoigu brought us,&#8221; referring to the defence minister <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18266028/sergei-shoigu-heart-attack-poisoning-claims-leonid-nevzlin/">Sergei Shoigu</a>.</p>

<p>The photo&#8217;s original source is unclear, but it&#8217;s believed it was originally shared on several popular Russian Telegram accounts and blogs, including one which is crowdfunding to buy Putin&#8217;s soldiers equipment.</p>



<p>In a video shared online by a Canadian foreign fighter who joined the Ukrainian military, a Russian helmet is seen being easily crushed underfoot.</p>



<p>A second earlier video shared on Twitter shows two Ukrainian soldiers picking up an abandoned Russian helmet.</p>



<p>One takes off the helmet cover to reveal a large hole where a bullet or shrapnel has torn through the thin metal.</p>

<p>Despite Russia having the fifth biggest military budget in the world &#8211; around £52.4 billion last year &#8211; their own soldiers&#8217; welfare doesn&#8217;t appear to have been a priority.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Russians have invested a lot of money in their military, and I&#8217;m certain the combat first-aid kits would not have broken the bank,&#8221; former White House National Security Council director for Russia Jeffrey Edmonds told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/vladimir-putin-put-on-blast-over-pathetic-first-aid-kits-for-russian-troops-in-ukraine">The Daily Beast</a>.</p>



<p>He went on: &#8220;If I were a Russian soldier, I might think, &#8216;Well, okay, my general health in combat really isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s valued that much,&#8217;. It just shows a level of concern for your soldiers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of Russia&#8217;s military equipment could date back to the 1990s, or even earlier to before the fall of the USSR.</p>



<p>In a briefing last week, the nonprofit investigative group the Conflict Intelligence Team said: &#8220;A modern first-aid kit costs a lot of money, and the Soviet first-aid kit is already in stock, there is no need to buy it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Such a first-aid kit is not useless, but it is much worse than the ones the Ukrainians have… The Ukrainian army has much more time to save the wounded before they die.&#8221;</p>

<p>It follows reports that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18309956/russia-troops-cameras-game-pads-sat-navs-ukraine/">Russia&#8217;s tinpot army</a> has been forced to use off-the-shelf cameras, gamepads, and sat navs to fix up its planes and drones.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s soldiers have become bogged down in Ukraine &#8211; with the country now littered with corpses and the wrecks of Putin&#8217;s vehicles.</p>



<p>Kremlin soldiers have reportedly been left under-equipped, under-resourced, facing starvation, and even suffering from their vehicles running out of fuel.</p>



<p>And photos and videos show some of the ragtag, off-the-shelf gear which Russian troops are being forced to use to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Footage&nbsp;shows a soldier&nbsp;dismantling a Russian military surveillance drone that crashed in Ukraine, only to find that the drone is not as advanced as one might expect.</p>



<p>The clip, released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, shows that the drone uses a Canon camera that is mounted on a board with duct tape.</p>



<p>And the mode dial of the camera has been sealed with glue- not exactly the high-tech military equipment Russia boasts to have.</p>



<p>The camera used in the drone is a Canon EOS Rebel T6i, a £200-£300 DSLR camera launched in 2015.</p>



<p>And elsewhere in the clip, it shows the drone is jerry-rigged with a plastic bottle to use as a fuel tank.</p>

<p>Additionally, a report by Belarusian TV channel VoenTV appears to have accidentally revealed that Russian drones are controlled by cheap Logitech gamepads.</p>



<p>While desperate <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18342216/russians-creating-mad-max-armour-plated-vehicles/">Russians have been creating &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; vehicles</a> with extra armour bolted on in fear of being wiped up by British anti-tank NLAW missiles.</p>



<p>Pictures from across the war-ravaged country appear to show how Putin&#8217;s monsters have tried to adapt their vehicles to shield themselves as they advance in their bloody invasion.</p>



<p>But the modifications &#8211; which look straight out of the blockbuster dystopian franchise Mad Max &#8211; vary markedly.</p>



<p>One photo shows what looks like a troop carrier with a large bolted-on armour plate covering the windshield.</p>

<p>&#8220;She just walked away and continued walking out the mall, and he followed her.&#8221; </p>



<p>Viewers on social media felt bad for the man who is seen looking downcast as he makes an exit. </p>



<p>One person said: &#8220;It’s sad he thought he had a one up on her to propose at the McDonald’s in front of everyone. </p>



<p>&#8220;I just know he wasn’t listening to her cause she probably said how she wanted her proposal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another wrote: &#8220;She has a right to decline… proposal in McDonald’s is wild as f***.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>A CARIBBEAN leader nicked in a major cocaine bust is said to have moaned to undercover agents that “the British didn’t pay him much”.</strong></p>



<p>British Virgin Islands premier Andrew Fahie, 51, was allegedly held in a sting by agents posing as traffickers from a Mexican cartel.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18419836" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729516601.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18419836" width="960" height="768" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Andrew Fahie was arrested in an undercover sting operation[/caption]

<p>THE UK is sending war crimes experts to help Ukraine with its investigations into atrocities by Russian invaders, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced.</p>



<p>The Foreign Office said the team of experts, due to arrive in neighbouring <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/poland/">Poland </a>in early May, will support the Ukrainian government in gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes and include experts in conflict-related sexual violence. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18420206" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729267287.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18420206" width="960" height="667" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Mortuary workers stand next to stretchers with bags containing bodies of victims in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv[/caption]



<p>Ms <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/liz-truss/">Truss </a>said: “Russia has brought barbarity to Ukraine and committed vile atrocities, including against women.</p>



<p>“British expertise will help uncover the truth and hold Putin’s regime to account for its actions. Justice will be done.”</p>



<p>She went to The Hague yesterday to meet the president of the International Criminal Court, which is probing the atrocities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow </a>does not recognise the authority of the ICC, presenting obvious difficulties.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence said Russia is paying a high price for limited gains of land in Ukraine&#8217;s east.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Battle of Donbas remains Russia&#8217;s main strategic focus, in order to achieve its stated aim of securing control over the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts,&#8221; the department said in its latest intelligence update.</p>



<p>&#8220;Due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces.&#8221;</p>

<p>BRIT ISIS terrorist Alexanda Kotey was jailed for life in the US over his role in killing Western hostages in Syria yesterday before the daughter of one of his victims told him: &#8220;Rot in hell.&#8221;</p>



<p>The heartless jihadi didn&#8217;t react and walked out of the court room after being forced to listen to agonising victim impact statements.</p>

<p>Bethany Haines &#8211; whose dad David, an ex RAF Scot, was executed in 2014 while doing aid work &#8211; walked up to Kotey, pointed and told him to &#8220;go rot in hell&#8221;.</p>



<p>London-born Kotey was one of the so-called <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5536512/who-alexanda-kotey-el-shafee-elsheikh-where-now/">Islamic State militants nicknamed The Beatles</a> by their captives due to their English accents.</p>



<p>Kotey, along with ringleader Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, and El Shafee Elsheikh&nbsp;were responsible for the brutal killings of several Western hostages, including Alan Henning and David Haines. </p>



<p>Bethany said she could never forgive her father&#8217;s &#8220;remorseless&#8221; killers.</p>

<p>&#8220;These two men are selfish and only care about themselves and until they accept their actions, admit to what they’ve done, and apologise, then there is no chance they will be forgiven by me. I have no pity for them,&#8221; she told the court.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;Celebrating birthdays or Christmas is not an enjoyable experience for me anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;My dad should be celebrating with me, but instead he is in a mass grave in the hills of Raqqa. </p>



<p>&#8220;He hasn’t been laid to rest, he was dumped like a bag of rubbish.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she had &#8220;struggled wondering why monsters, like these two men, are on this earth but my father isn’t&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kotey was emotionless as Judge Thomas Selby Ellis handed his verdict down at Alexandria District Court, Virginia, as Kotey&#8217;s family watched on from the public gallery.</p>



<p>The 38-year-old was given a life sentence for each of the eight counts <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16037495/isis-beatles-member-admits-torture-hostages/">he pleaded guilty to</a> and which are being run concurrently.</p>



<p>Judge Ellis described the sick jihadi&#8217;s actions as &#8220;egregious, violent and inhumane&#8221;.</p>



<p>Speaking of Kotey&#8217;s victims, the judge said: &#8220;These were not prisoners of war, these weren&#8217;t soldiers in the field&#8230; they were soldiers for good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Athea Haines, Haines other daughter, told the court she was just four when her father was killed &#8211; she is 11 now.</p>



<p>The girl sobbed into her mothers arms as she said: &#8220;I miss him so much. Sometimes I get sad when I see my friends from school and club laughing and playing with their dads. </p>



<p>&#8220;That is something I will never have a chance to do again. It is not easy to be that kid in school whose dad was killed by terrorists&#8221;.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Shirley Sotloff, the mother of slain journalist Steven Sotloff, walked closer to Kotey and Elsheikh to address them and demanded they look at her.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;The sickness in our stomachs the minute we wake up and the psychological trauma that we relive over and over and over. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are forever broken by the loss of our beloved son and defined as the people from the horror movie&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kotey pleaded guilty to charges in September last year and apparently agreed to co-operate with US authorities as part of his plea deal.</p>



<p>His charges included four counts of hostage taking resulting in death; conspiracy to commit hostage taking resulting in death; conspiracy to murder US citizens outside the country; conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, hostage taking and murder, resulting in death; and conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation resulting in death.</p>



<p>Kotey admitted he left the UK with the belief that &#8220;the Islamic concept of armed jihad was a valid and legitimate cause and means by which a Muslim defends his fellow Muslim against injustice&#8221;.</p>



<p>He also admitted to capturing hostages and said when that came to an end, he moved onto working in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/isis/">ISIS</a>&#8216; recruitment division.</p>



<p>His charges were in relation to the slaying of four US hostages &#8211; journalists <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16041438/mum-hostage-killed-isis-beatle-begs/">James Foley</a> and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.</p>



<p>Kotey&#8217;s co-defendant, Elsheikh, was convicted earlier this month and is expected to be sentence at a later date.</p>



<p>Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015, and Davis was jailed in Turkey in 2017.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5543527/first-custody-picture-of-captured-brit-isis-fighter-who-was-member-of-the-beatles-beheading-gang-with-jihadi-john/">Kotey</a>&nbsp;grew up in Paddington, West London, and has been described as having a Ghanaian and Greek-Cypriot background.</p>



<p>The jihadi, believed to be aged around 36, was a convert to Islam as a teenager.</p>

<p>A LITTLE boy and girl playfully clamber through a wrecked Russian armoured car — proving that innocent fun can be had in the grimmest of places.</p>



<p>Another child, perches on a burnt-out military hulk in the liberated Ukrainian village of Lukashivka near <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844661/russia-deliberately-killing-civilians-ukraine-chernihiv-zhytomyr/">Chernihiv </a>in a long-awaited sign of normal life.</p>

<p>The pair were on a rescue mission to evacuate civilians when they were held on suspicion of spying, 30 miles from a nuclear power plant.</p>

<p>Paul, 45, from Manchester, and Dylan, 22, from Cambridgeshire, travelled to Ukraine alone and were working as volunteers, according to the UK non-profit organisation Presidium Network.</p>



<p>Paul’s mum Linda described his capture as her “worst nightmare”.</p>



<p>She said her son, a Type 1 diabetic who could die without access to insulin, had travelled to Ukraine about ten days ago. She said: “I begged him not to because Russia’s bad.</p>



<p>“I was on FaceTime with him up to 4am on Monday morning and that was it — gone.”</p>

<p>Asked how she was feeling, she replied: “Like I want to die, like I don’t know what to do any more. I don’t know. It’s horrible.” </p>



<p>She said her son was “too caring” and “too kind”.</p>



<p>Sophie Goldring, who went to college with Dylan, said she was in contact with him on Snapchat. She said: “He wanted to go to Ukraine to help.”</p>



<p>Another friend, Allan Moore, 29, said Dylan was “just a kid from a council estate who went out there to help”.</p>



<p>Dylan had been sharing fundraising appeals on Facebook.</p>



<p>In his last message on April 16 he wrote: “At the moment fundraising is for another vehicle to enable us to evacuate more people at a time but the fundraiser will continue and will be updated to what the needs would require at that stage.”</p>



<p>Dylan is believed to have been in Ukraine for at least six weeks.</p>



<p>The Presidium Network, which has been organising relief for civilians in Kyiv, said the men were driving to help a woman and two kids evacuate.</p>



<p>Dominik Byrne, one of the network’s founders, said: “We want to tell the Russians that these aren’t spies. These aren’t military people.</p>



<p>“These are just humanitarian workers who got caught in a bad situation.”</p>



<p>He said the men were mostly helping with the distribution of medical aid and also helping terrified civilians flee to safety.</p>

<p>THE terrifying moment a group of teenagers encountered a crocodile while swimming at a tourist hotspot has been caught on camera. </p>



<p>Osmar Ochoa was swimming with a group of friends in Tulum, Mexico, when he came across the deadly beast. </p>

<p>Nail-biting footage then shows Osmar edging closer toward the wild animal.</p>



<p>His underwater camera captures heart-stopping footage of the crocodile as it decides where to head next. </p>

<p>ANOTHER British fighter captured in Ukraine has been paraded on Russian TV after apparently suffering gunshot wounds.</p>



<p>He was named as Andrew Hill, a dad of four from Plymouth, and appeared to be wounded with a head bandage and his left arm in a sling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hill looked tired and terrified and kept his head bowed as he looked at the floor, occasionally glancing up nervously as he asked if he would ever get back to England.</p>



<p>He is the third Brit fighter to be held &#8211; after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin</a> were also paraded by their Russian captors.</p>



<p>And it comes a day after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">Scott Sibley became the first Briton to be killed in the conflict</a>.</p>



<p>Hill said he had been shot and begged to go to hospital in the forced video appearance today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking weak and fearing for his safety, Hill was subjected to an interrogation on Rossiya 1 state TV.</p>



<p>When he asked how long he would be held before being allowed back to England, he was told: “I can&#8217;t tell you anything about that, but you can rest assured you&#8217;re safe.”</p>



<p>Andy said he was carrying a Czech-made CZ assault rifle when he was captured, and that Russian troops had administered first aid.</p>



<p>The channel said: “Andrew Hill laid down his arms and surrendered to the Russian military in the Mykolaiv region, after the group of mercenaries in which he fought was defeated and he himself was injured.”</p>

<p>He was used to trumpet a Russian message when asked: &#8220;What would you like to say to other Englishmen who decide to go to Ukraine?”</p>



<p>He replied: “They need to really think about it. This doesn’t involve us.”</p>



<p>In other exchanges, the Brit said he was divorced and that his father died on New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>



<p>“Is there anybody else who can care about you?” the TV interrogator asked</p>



<p>He replied: &#8220;My children, I have four children, and I do have a partner whom I’m dating now.”</p>



<p>Hill also explained how he flew to Poland and crossed the border from the town of Rzeszov into Ukraine alone.</p>



<p>He said he was not paid to fight &#8211; contradicting the TV interrogator&#8217;s description of him as a mercenary.</p>



<p>Hill then pleaded: &#8220;Am I safe?&#8221; and was assured he will not be harmed.</p>

<p>He said Russian soldiers had given first aid for the gunshot wound in the arm, and asked if he would be taken to hospital after the interview.</p>



<p>“Yes, you will be taken care of,” the interrogator said.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, ex-soldier Shaun Pinner, 48, was paraded on TV twice and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18289020/russians-taunt-captured-hero-brit-fighter-propaganda/">taunted by Russians</a> who lied that his Ukrainian comrades wanted him dead.</p>



<p>Aiden Aslin, 28, was seen covered in bruises and being threatened with the death penalty in a disturbing video that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18384222/boris-johnson-talktv-video-aiden-aslin-removed-facebook/">Facebook eventually agreed to take down</a>.</p>



<p>Both men were captured during the siege of Mariupol.</p>



<p>Yesterday it was reported that Royal Marines veteran Scott Sibley, 36, had been killed fighting alongside Ukrainian defenders in besieged Mykolaiv.</p>



<p>Friends said he was &#8220;the bravest person&#8221; they knew and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408138/brit-scott-sibley-killed-fighting-ukraine/">showed commando spirit to the end</a>.</p>

<p>THE LEGENDARY Ghost of Kyiv fighter pilot has been killed in battle after Ukraine claimed he shot down 40 Russian warplanes.</p>



<p>The brave fighter became popular at the start of Putin&#8217;s invasion when the Ukrainian military shared an image of him claiming he had shot down ten Russian jets.</p>

<p>Dad-of-one Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29, was killed on March 13, while fighting “overwhelming” enemy forces, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ghost-of-kyiv-who-shot-down-more-than-40-russian-aircraft-dies-in-battle-q3sq0hztx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Times</a> reported.</p>



<p>Ukrainian sources confirmed the identity and his death adding that they expected his helmet and goggles to go for sale at an auction in London.</p>



<p>The 29-year-old from the village of Korolivka in western Ukraine has left behind his wife Olenia and their eight-year-old son Yarik.</p>



<p>He was posthumously awarded Ukraine’s top medal for bravery in combat, the Order of the Golden Star, with the title Hero of Ukraine.</p>

<p>After his death, his parents gave an interview to NPR with his mum Nahtalia recalling how he used to watch the MiG jets when he was younger.</p>



<p>She said via a translator:  “He would always watch the paratroopers in their air exercises.</p>



<p>&#8220;And he would run in their direction to try to see where they landed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since early childhood, he always dreamed of the sky, about flying higher than the clouds.” </p>

<p>She added: “At any opportunity, he would fly close to our house, do a little aerobatic trick. </p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone in the village, every house and all the villages around would know that is Stepan flying.&#8221;</p>



<p>The pilot&#8217;s dad Evon, a construction worker, said the Ukrainian military would not give them any details of his son&#8217;s death.</p>



<p id="last-paragraph">He said: “We know he was flying on a mission. And he completed the mission, his task. </p>



<p id="last-paragraph">&#8220;Then he didn’t return. That’s all the information we have, really.”</p>

<p>The so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17786814/debunked-urban-legend-ghost-kyiv-promoted-ukrainian-govt/">Ghost of Kyiv</a>&nbsp;became a symbol of resistance in the face of Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion after Ukrainian government officials shared macho propaganda of the masked pilot appearing to shoot down enemy planes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And rightly so – this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircrafts.”</p>



<p>The footage starts with a cartoon mock-up of the plane, before going into the debunked footage of a destroyed Russian jet.</p>



<p>Text then appears on the video, which states: “Ukraine probably got its first ace since World War II. This is the anonymous pilot of the MiG-29, nicknamed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17796004/who-ghost-of-kyiv-real/">Ghost of Kyiv.</a></p>

<p>THE terrifying moment a huge great white shark swam under a group of paddleboarders has been captured on video.</p>



<p>The footage shows just how close the beast was to the shoreline as beachgoers looked on in horror.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18415322" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 402px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/c9042905-ca16-4dbe-b51f-ebfac2a5802c.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=392" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18415322" width="392" height="696" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Footage shows the moment the shark swam below shocked paddleboarders</figcaption><figcredit>Reddit</figcredit></figure>

<p>The sinister outline of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sharks/">shark</a> could be seen as it stalked the flimsy boards in scenes reminiscent of Jaws.</p>



<p>But luckily for those nearby, it decided to swim on as the short clip came to an end.</p>



<p>The user responsible for the Reddit post, claimed that it was simply a &#8220;normal&#8221; occurrence for regular paddleboarders in certain parts of world.</p>



<p>It came as other users in the comments noted just how calm the onlookers behaved as the huge beast passed by.</p>

<p>“How are these people so calm?! There is a shark in the water,” one exclaimed.</p>



<p>A second wrote: “Awesome sight to behold though. I&#8217;d love to see a shark up close in person.”</p>



<p>While a third added: “Such a beautiful creature. “A big boi too. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swim tho.”</p>



<p>The footage comes just a day after a panicked paddleboarder filmed his terrifying experience at the mercy of a huge tiger shark as it hunted turtles below him.</p>

<p>Video showed Aussie Brodie Moss as he was thrown into the sea after the predator had <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18401385/video-tiger-shark-paddleboarder-brodie-moss-youtube/">chomped on his board by mistake</a>.</p>



<p>Thankfully he was unharmed in the close encounter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He wrote alongside the video on Instagram: &#8220;A humbling reminder for myself that it’s their ocean and I’m just a visitor!</p>



<p>&#8220;I love sharks and this little accident was not the big fellas fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>The viral video was filmed in Western <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a> &#8211; notably one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16671715/australia-shark-attack-map-maulings-year/">the world&#8217;s hot spots for shark attacks</a>&nbsp;on humans.</p>



<p>In November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13265338/man-savaged-shark-bodyboarding-australia/">bodyboarder was savaged to death</a>&nbsp;near Broome, the eighth fatal attack that year.</p>



<p>A year later Brit dad Paul Millachip was mauled to death while swimming in Freemantle.</p>



<p>There were claims he was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16674023/australia-shark-attack-great-white-tiger/">attacked by a great white and a tiger shark</a>&nbsp;at the same time.</p>

<p>In February this year a British diving instructor was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17678121/brit-man-killed-shark-safety-net-australia/">killed by a 15ft great white</a>&nbsp;in Sydney.</p>



<p>Experts say most victims are bitten when the sharks mistake them for prey such as seals.</p>

<p>The footage shows a series of Kalibr long-range rockets emerging from the Black Sea and streaking into the sky.</p>



<p>It is the first time Russia has reported using its submarine fleet to attack Ukraine.</p>



<p>Just four days ago &#8220;leaked&#8221; pictures showed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18367747/leaked-pics-show-russian-submarine-loaded-with-nukes/">Kalibr missiles being loaded into a sub</a> in Crimean port Sevastopol.</p>



<p>&#8220;The crew of a diesel-electric submarine of the Black Sea Fleet launched a salvo of Kalibr cruise missiles at the military infrastructure of the Ukrainian armed forces from the Black Sea&#8221;, Russia&#8217;s defence ministry said today.</p>

<p>It claimed the rockets destroyed three electricity substations at Ukrainian railway junctions in Fastiv, Krasnosilka and Polonne.</p>



<p>Russia is said to have switched to firing from submarines at a safe distance after its <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/">Black Sea flagship the Moskva was sunk</a> in a humiliating blow to Putin.</p>



<p>The Kalibr rocket can reportedly carry conventional or nuclear warheads and strike targets 750 miles away.</p>



<p>Meanwhile residential blocks in the capital Kyiv were hit by yet more rocket blitzes yesterday and today &#8211; killing a journalist and injuring a number of civilians.</p>

<p>One strike came during a visit by UN Secretary-General António Guterres to areas around Kyiv that were pillaged by Russian forces before the retreat. </p>



<p>“The war is evil,” he said while standing beside destroyed blocks of flats in the smashed commuter town of Borodyanka.</p>



<p>Russia was forced to abandon its shambolic assault on Kyiv after heavy losses.</p>



<p>Instead of pursuing a peace deal, the Kremlin has stepped up threats to Western nations supplying military hardware to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Putin himself darkly warned he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">could use nuclear weapons against the UK and European allies</a> in a speech earlier this week.</p>



<p>Today Russian state TV broadcast a chilling map claiming to show how fast a Sarmat ICBM could strike from the Kaliningrad enclave in the Baltic.</p>



<p>It gleefully warns Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>



<p>Last night Britain&#8217;s defence secretary Ben Wallace warned Putin <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408151/putin-world-war-three-within-days/">could declare a new world war in days</a>.</p>



<p>He said he fears&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">the Russian tyrant</a>&nbsp;might use traditional Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which commemorate the end of World War Two, for a mass mobilisation of troops.</p>



<p>Those fears were echoed today by Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy strategic commander for Europe.</p>



<p>He told&nbsp;BBC Radio 4’s Today program&nbsp;the Kremlin was likely to respond aggressively but assisting Ukraine was still the &#8220;right approach&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: “The worst case is war with Russia.</p>



<p>“By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.”</p>



<h2 id="cancerous-growth">&#8216;Cancerous growth&#8217;</h2>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s military claims Russia has so far lost 22,000 troops in the unwinnable conflict, which has now entered its tenth week.</p>



<p>Russia switched its focus from occupying the whole country to an attempt to seized the eastern Donbas region and the southern corridor near Crimea.</p>



<p>But Ukraine is continuing to put up fierce resistance, bouyed by its amazing success so far in repelling the much larger invasion force.</p>



<p>Last night Mr Wallace told LBC radio: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he&#8217;s got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.</p>



<p>“We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.”</p>



<p>He vowed Britain would continue sending aid including anti-tank and anti-air missiles and plans to send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a>.</p>



<p>And he added he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;rattled&#8221; by the tyrant&#8217;s threats.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Because we have strong Armed Forces and a nuclear deterrent and we’re part of a Nato partnership of 30 nations who outgun him, outnumber him and have potentially all the capabilities at our disposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don’t fear him. I think we should be very grateful in this country that we have a nuclear deterrent, I think that is a really important part of his calculations.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m very grateful that somewhere under the sea, some amazing men and women are deep underwater, hiding, waiting, in case Britain needs to be protected. That’s important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now new CCTV images obtained by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/mexico/">Mexican</a> TV show the law student buying booze with friends on the night she vanished.</p>



<p>She is also seen walking to a party in the suburbs of Monterrey, and then an alarming clip shows her being chased down the street by a young man.</p>



<p>Debanhi is seen kicking and slapping at the man during an argument before pals intervene.</p>



<p>It was not clear if police believe this scuffle was relevant to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18373772/debanhi-escobar-missing-teen-mexico-murdered-last-video/">the tragedy that followed</a> in the early hours of April 9.</p>

<p>Debanhi was then seen getting a taxi home, but it dropped her off near the Nueva Castilla motel after a reported row.</p>

<p>Further CCTV images released by prosecutors show her final steps in the minutes after leaving the taxi. </p>



<p>She is seen walking further down the road, crossing to the middle and returning to the pavement.</p>

<p>Debanhi kept walking and stopped outside a haulage company at 4.29am.</p>



<p>Another video shows the teenager running towards the motel driveway at 4.35am and looking through the door of a restaurant a minute later.</p>



<p>There are no surveillance cameras in the area where Debanhi was found in the motel grounds, the attorney general&#8217;s office said.</p>



<p>Her body was discovered lying in an open-air cistern on April 21 after a worker noticed a foul smell.</p>



<p>Police had searched the grounds at least four times during her 13-day disappearance &#8211; sparking disbelief and fury from her family.</p>



<p>It remains unknown how she ended up in the cistern, but pathologists believe she was alive when she went in.</p>



<p>Eduardo Villagómez, director of the state’s forensic services, said she hit her head and drowned. </p>



<p>&#8220;She was alive (for a moment) where she was found and there was an opportunity for her to react,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The cause of the death was a contusion to the skull, officials said. </p>



<p>It has not been determined if she fell or was pushed, but the case is being investigated as a homicide.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have to put together the puzzle with what we have and what is obtained to clarify the reason for Debanhi&#8217;s death,&#8221; said Gustavo Guerrero, the attorney general of Nuevo Leon State.</p>



<p>Debanhi&#8217;s father Mario Escobar is not ruling out murder and has considered exhuming her body for a second autopsy.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;There are many hypotheses, like my daughter could have been alive, like could she have been kidnapped, how she fell without seeing, how she could have been placed there.</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, we do not rule out any line of investigation. I think I am calm… because they are answering what we have talked about.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="massive-human-failure">&#8216;Massive human failure&#8217;</h2>



<p>It comes after the family accused investigators of withholding information and not taking the case seriously.</p>



<p>Aldo Fasci, a senior Mexican politician, branded the failure to find Debanhi&#8217;s body sooner a &#8220;massive human failure&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Neuva Castilla motel had been the main focus of the investigation with dozens of volunteers, search dogs and drones meeting there every morning to plan out their search.</p>



<p>Distraught dad Mario blasted police as they removed her body from the scene last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thirteen days here! How many times were you here looking?&#8221; he shouted.</p>



<p>After a national outcry, the attorney general announced two prosecutors had been sacked from the missing persons and kidnapping unit for omitting details.</p>



<p>He released the CCTV images in a new push for transparency as Mexican authorities face claims of failing to tackle an epidemic of crimes against women.</p>



<p>Another young woman María Fernanda Contreras, 26, was found dead just four miles from Debanhi last week.</p>



<p>So far in 2022, at least 41 young women have gone missing just in the suburbs of Monterrey, and more than 1,700 are missing in the state since 2010.</p>



<p>Across Mexico, seven women go missing every day.</p>

<p>Protesters marched in Mexico City and elsewhere following the discovery of the two bodies in Monterrey.</p>



<p>President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador tried to reassure his people in a recent press conference, insisting that the news &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t worry&#8221; Mexicans because it &#8220;happens everywhere&#8221;.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin could turn the Ukraine war nuclear by dropping a bomb over the Black Sea or firing at a US target, a national security expert has said. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> has already warned its shambolic invasion of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18402754/russia-ukraine-invasion-threat-nuclear-world-war-putin/">likely to end in a nuclear world war</a> with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">the Russian tyrant</a> &#8220;more probable&#8221; to launch a nuke than accept defeat. </p>

<p>While the threats have been dismissed by both the US and the UK as mere bluster, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/">fears of an all-out war using nuclear armaments are a realistic possibility</a> as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine falters and troops continue to meet fierce opposition.</p>



<p>Concerns were raised after Russia&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">test-fired its nuclear missile Sarmat 2</a>&nbsp;last week, with Putin boasting it was able to strike anywhere on earth and couldn’t be stopped by existing missile defences.</p>



<p>Joseph Cirincione, a distinguished fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/washington/">Washington</a>, D.C, has now revealed five chilling ways Putin could unleash nuclear weapons on the world. </p>



<p>Speaking on Bill Press Pods, he warned the Russian dictator could initially fire nukes into the Black Sea as a &#8220;demonstration shot&#8221; before using nuclear weapons on targets in Ukraine. </p>

<p>And in a worrying worst case scenario, Mr Cirincione said Putin could fire at Nato targets or even the United States.</p>



<p>The threat of a nuclear attack has been played down by the West. </p>



<p>UK Armed Forces minister&nbsp;James Heappey said there was no &#8220;imminent threat of escalation&#8221;, while Defence Secretary Ben Wallace wrote off the warnings as Putin &#8220;distracting the world and the public from what he’s actually doing in Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>But Mr Cirincione said: &#8220;The first possibility is you would use a nuclear weapon in a demonstration shot, so you would fire something into the Black Sea, for example. </p>

<p>&#8220;The purpose of this is to &#8216;escalate to de-escalate&#8217; if the war is going badly. </p>



<p>&#8220;If the Russians felt they were on the verge of defeat, they would fire off a nuclear shot to indicate the seriousness of the situation, and to cause the West to back off. </p>



<p>&#8220;If that were to happen, I would say the reaction would be shock and horror &#8211; but it would not require a military response. </p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do anything there. I would say the US response would be more diplomatic.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a second scenario, Mr Cirincione said Putin could unleash a &#8220;very low yield weapon&#8221; on a military target in Ukraine, killing thousands and causing major damage. </p>



<p>&#8220;Again, the US would not necessarily require a military solution,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>&#8220;The third possibility is that they use a serious nuclear weapon &#8211; Hiroshima sized or more &#8211; and it strikes and it destroys a city in Ukraine. </p>



<p>&#8220;At that point, that&#8217;s where things get quite serious. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would immediately expect to see long-range military response from Nato. Not Nato forces on the ground, but long-range strikes, which we are perfectly capable of doing. </p>



<p>&#8220;We could strike the launch site, for example, and definitely send a message saying &#8216;do not do this again&#8217;. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re trying to do, trying to control the escalation.&#8221; </p>



<h2 id="targeting-nato">TARGETING NATO</h2>



<p>But he insisted Nato would not fire a nuclear weapon on Russia in retaliation under this scenario. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is where we go to the fourth scenario&#8230; targeting a Nato base,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you saw a low-yield weapon used on a Nato target, then you would get a Nato air and ground assault, that would just wipe off the Russian military in Ukraine. </p>



<p>&#8220;We could do that, it would take a couple of weeks, but we could end the war if we wanted to. </p>



<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re trying to avoid is Russia firing again &#8211; another nuclear weapon. That&#8217;s where it gets extremely risky. Putin may feel he has no option but to launch.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;This is why the fifth and final stage &#8211; if Putin would use a nuclear weapon on a US target and used a long-range missile to fire at the US &#8211; then all bets are off.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question the US military command would be nearly universal in demanding we respond with a nuclear strike. </p>



<p>&#8220;It would probably be multiple strikes to knock out the command structure and some of their capabilities before they could respond &#8211; including knocking out Putin himself.&#8221; </p>



<p>Mr Cirincione said top US government officials would be working through the scenarios and preparing possible responses if Putin&#8217;s war escalates.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe these scenarios are being worked in the US government,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just gave you five, but I bet they have a list of 25  that go into more fine-tuning on what you would do and how you would do it. </p>



<p>&#8220;But I believe for many of these scenarios, you have to go quite a way up before you get to the US nuclear response.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;The risk of Putin going nuclear are low. The barriers against use are formidable. But he could do it and he might do it. </p>



<p>&#8220;We should be publicly discussing the options so the Western publics fully understand the risks and can have a say in the responses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov first raised the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18375080/nuclear-world-war-real-danger-britain-nato-target/">possibility of launching nuclear weapons</a>&nbsp;during an interview on Russian state TV on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Responding to a question on whether the current standoff between east and west could be compared to the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War, he said the situation was even more dangerous.</p>



<p>He explained this was because the weapons involved now were more powerful, the controls on them more lax, and communication between the two sides is non-existent.</p>



<p>Lavrov said: “During the Cuban Missile Crisis there were not many ‘written’ rules. But the rules of conduct were clear enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Moscow understood how Washington was behaving. Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left.”</p>



<p>Putin followed with a threat of his own &#8211; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">vowing a “lightning-fast” response</a>&nbsp;to any country who directly intervened in the conflict.</p>



<p>During a meeting of lawmakers in St Petersburg, he said: &#8220;If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia.</p>



<p>&#8220;They must know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning-fast. Fast.</p>

<p>While Putin did not directly mention the use of nuclear weapons, it would seem he was making a reference to the Sarmat missile.</p>

<p>A HERO British dad has been reportedly kidnapped by Russian forces after he was accused of being a spy.</p>



<p>The worried mum of volunteer Paul Urey has begged for her son to be released after he was detained by Russian troops in the city of Zaporizhzhia.</p>

<p>According to the non-profit organisation Presidium Network, he was captured alongside another British aid worker, Dylan Healy.</p>



<p>The two men were on a rescue mission to save a woman and two children in Dniprorudne.</p>



<p>Dominik Byrne, the co-founder and chief operating officer of the charity, said that the men who were working independently as humanitarian aid volunteers were last heard from on Monday.</p>



<p>He said the family were later interrogated by Russian forces, who asked them about the British spies.</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s mum  Linda Urey said in a statement: &#8220;My family and I are extremely worried.</p>



<p>&#8220;We know my son Paul and his friend who was humanitarian aid volunteer in Ukraine has been captured by the Russians.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was out there on his own accord. We want everyone’s support to bring son home and pray he is safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son Paul Urey is also Type 1 Diabetic and needs his Insulin.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have asked the Presidium Network to help us and also the FCDO to help as well.  We pray for him and hope he is safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paul has been described as a &#8220;family man with children&#8221; who decided to work in the humanitarian sector and travelled a lot.</p>



<p>He also worked for eight years in Afghanistan as a &#8220;civilian contractor working on back-office support.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Presidium Network said they lost contact with Paul on Monday at 4am.</p>



<p>Someone claiming to be him responded to messages later but failed to use code words and provide personal information.</p>



<p>The charity said the messages &#8220;were not written in their natural style and failed to issue code words for security,&#8221; adding that they &#8220;are verified as fake&#8221;.</p>



<p>Three hours after the men were taken, the woman’s house was stormed by armed Russian soldiers.</p>



<p>They made her husband lie on the floor and asked how &#8220;she knew these British spies&#8221;.</p>



<p>The charity added that they fear &#8220;the Russians will paint them as British Spies.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="first-uk-casualty">FIRST UK CASUALTY</h3>



<p>It comes after the first UK casualty was named yesterday as British armed forces <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">veteran  Scott Sibley</a> and another Brit volunteer is missing.</p>



<p>Trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan told Sky News: &#8220;I know that the Foreign Office will be working very closely with both the authorities and families to understand [what is happening] and support them.</p>



<p>&#8220;That will be ongoing at pace in the days ahead. It&#8217;s a tragic story and our hearts go out to the families involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added that Putin&#8217;s invasion &#8220;continues to be completely outrageous&#8221; and UK and its allies are &#8220;doing all they can in their fight to drive Putin out&#8221;.</p>



<p>Tributes were paid yesterday to dad Scott Sibley, who was killed in Ukraine while reportedly fighting Russian troops. </p>



<p>His former comrades described him as &#8220;the bravest person&#8221; they knew.</p>



<p>A second Brit volunteer is missing in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> after travelling to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">warzone</a> following the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> invasion.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can confirm that a British national has been killed in Ukraine and are supporting their family,&#8221; a Foreign, Development and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The spokesperson said about the second man: &#8220;We are aware of a British national who is missing in Ukraine and are supporting their family. We are urgently seeking further information.&#8221;</p>



<p>No further details about the British nationals have been released by the Foreign Office.</p>



<p>His loving wife Victoria posted: &#8220;We are overwhelmed with everyone&#8217;s kind messages and beautiful memories that have been shared with us so far.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sibley, who was pictured with the Ukrainian flag on his uniform appears to have been a former member of the Commando Logistic Support Squadron.</p>



<p>They posted on social media: &#8220;This week the Sqn has lost a former serving soldier. </p>



<p>&#8220;A man that showed Commando spirit until the end. RIP. Scott Sibley&#8221;</p>



<p>Devastated friends and family paid tribute to a &#8220;beautiful guy inside and out&#8221;.</p>



<p>His friend Alex Darwin, who served with him, wrote on a Facebook post: &#8220;I’m in complete disbelief.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you &amp; to of experienced your kind nature. </p>

<p>&#8220;You were there for me, &amp; I will forever be grateful.</p>



<p>&#8220;One hell of a beautiful guy, inside &amp; out! Stand down, Scott Sibley.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another friend shared: &#8220;Scott Sibley you were a good friend, and funny as hell. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will be missed by everyone who ever met you that&#8217;s for sure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Until the big re-org in the sky brother. Stand down soldier, your duty is over. RIP, It&#8217;s our stag now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Two Gofundme pages have been set up to help his family cover funeral costs.</p>



<p>One of them, set up by Craig Gant reads: &#8220;Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle.</p>



<p>&#8220;To me, he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.&#8221;</p>



<p>The second Gofundme page reads: &#8220;I know only a couple of us got to meet sibs outside of our community and many had arranged to meet him or couldn’t due to long distance, however each of us that had the pleasure of knowing sibs were affected by his contagious laugh and ability to cheer us up! (Or wind us up haha)</p>



<p>&#8220;We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways, if you would like to write anything with your donation feel free to do that his family can see how much he was loved by us all!</p>



<p>&#8220;Rest in peace Sibs we will never forget you&#8221;</p>



<p>The news follows the announcement that around 8,000 British troops are set to take part in exercises across Eastern Europe in a bid to combat Russian aggression.</p>



<p>This would be one of the largest British deployments since the Cold War.</p>



<p>Dozens of tanks will be deployed, from Finland in the north to North Macedonia in the south, in response to the ongoing military crisis in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The Queen&#8217;s Royal Hussars are set to be embedded into an armoured brigade in Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia.</p>



<p>Exercises will also take place alongside American troops in Poland.</p>



<p>Manoeuvers are scheduled to take place at least until June.</p>

<p>The Brit forces will be joined by tens of thousands of Nato and Joint Expeditionary Force troops.</p>



<p>This action had already been planned, but the Ministry of Defence said it had been enhanced in the wake of the war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse said: &#8220;The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression.</p>



<p>&#8220;The British Army&#8217;s series of exercises is fundamental to both.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British Army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century.&#8221;</p>



<p>Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: &#8220;The security of Europe has never been more important.</p>



<p>&#8220;These exercises will see our troops join forces with allies and partners across Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force in a show of solidarity and strength in one of the largest shared deployments since the Cold War.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as Brit volunteers Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28,  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">remain captured in Mariupol</a>.</p>



<p>Ex-squaddie Pinner was paraded by Russian state media in a chilling clip captioned: &nbsp;&#8220;Another mercenary was caught in Mariupol.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shaun Pinner is an English mercenary. He says that he no longer needs the war and he wants to go home. He won&#8217;t make it home.</p>



<p>&#8220;Captured Ukrainian soldiers testify about the atrocities of foreign mercenaries. And after the trial, they face the death penalty.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18265698/brit-fighter-captured-ukraine-first-pictures/">Pictures of Aslin</a> showing bruises and cuts on him, were shared online.</p>



<p>A good pal of Aslin has claimed that the soldier is &#8220;still alive&#8221; but Putin&#8217;s cronies have targeted his family trying to get them to &#8220;publicly cry and demand that he be swapped with the top traitor in Ukraine, Victor Medvedchuk.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the start of the invasion, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17895167/brit-fighting-ukraine-four-uk-fighters-missing/">a number of brave British soldiers</a> joined Ukraine in the fight against Putin.</p>

<p>A HEROIC US Marine veteran has been killed fighting Putin&#8217;s troops in Ukraine, his devastated loved ones have confirmed. </p>



<p>Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, had been for a private military contracting company when he was killed on Monday. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18412072" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729442188.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18412072" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook/ Willy Cancel</figcredit></figure>Former US Marine Willy Cancel has died while fighting alongside Ukrainians against Putin&#8217;s troops[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18412073" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729441788.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18412073" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook/ Brittany Cancel</figcredit></figure>He leaves behind grieving wife Brittany and their seven-month-old child[/caption]



<p>Cancel, who worked full-time as a corrections officer in Tennessee, flew to Poland on March 12 before crossing into Ukraine. </p>



<p>Rebecca Cabrera told CNN that her son had agreed to join the war effort as his company was searching for contractors to fight.</p>



<p>She said: “He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn’t come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn’t have to be involved in it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rebecca paid tribute to her son, saying he put others first.</p>





<p>She said: &#8220;He was just a really thoughtful person. He always put everybody ahead of himself even when situations were so stressful.</p>



<p>&#8220;He always kept everybody laughing and calm. He was the man that stood up when everybody else stood back.&#8221;</p>



<p>His widow, Brittany, 23, told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/former-marine-dies-fighting-alongside-ukrainians-widow-calls-him-a-hero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News Digital</a>: &#8220;He went there wanting to help people, he had always felt that that was his main mission in life.&#8221;</p>



<p>She admitted that she didn&#8217;t expect to be a widow at 23. </p>

<p>DESPERATE Russian commanders have resorted to drugging their own demoralised soldiers to stop them from running away, according to intercepted messages and phone calls.</p>



<p>In the messages, shared by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> Security Service, an exasperated <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> commander tells another he is &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/drugs/">shooting up</a>&#8221; his reluctant troops to make them fight in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war in Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>The video has been dubbed into English by Ukrainian voice actor Ivan Doan.</p>



<p>It opens with a text conversation reported to be between two Russian commanders on a messaging app, updating each other on the latest in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; the first asks, to which the second replies: &#8220;Not good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently referring to his own soldiers, he goes on: &#8220;They&#8217;re running away. My guys are also very scared now. Everybody&#8217;s tired. No strength left.&#8221;</p>

<p>He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m even shooting them up. Doesn&#8217;t help. I think they&#8217;re very tired.&#8221;</p>



<p>The video then goes on to an intercepted phone call which has been dubbed into English, again purported to be between two Russian soldiers.</p>



<p>One asks the other &#8220;how&#8217;s it going?&#8221;, to which the second replies: &#8220;It&#8217;s ok. Everybody&#8217;s apathetic already. Completely demoralised.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an apparent reference to the high Russian death count or desertion rate, he goes on: &#8220;The companies are like 10-15 people left at best. The officers are already panicking. They want it all to end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He goes on to say that his battalion has been fighting &#8220;for one and a half months daily,&#8221; and says that three days ago, &#8220;many f***ing panicked&#8221; following a Ukrainian ambush.</p>



<p>The soldier also describes many of the younger recruits brought in to sure up <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a>&#8216;s forces as &#8220;f***ing cowards&#8221;.</p>



<p>He concludes: &#8220;All-in-all, everybody&#8217;s fed up with all this,&#8221; and says all he wants to do is &#8220;go home, hug the kids, wife. That&#8217;s it, I don&#8217;t want anything else&#8221;.</p>



<p>It isn&#8217;t known exactly when and where the messages and calls were intercepted from.</p>



<p>However, this isn&#8217;t the first time Ukrainian authorities have intercepted Russian correspondence.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18361839/vladimir-putin-troops-reveal-mission/">Putin&#8217;s idiotic troops earlier revealed their plans</a> to capture Hostomel airport three days before on an unencrypted line.</p>



<p>When the elite VDV air assault troops tried to take the airfield 30 miles outside Kyiv,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18335072/brit-soldiers-training-ukrainian-troops-uk-bases/">Ukrainian troops</a>&nbsp;were lying in wait.</p>



<p>Their mission was pivotal to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18356517/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-health-rumours-easter/">Mad Vlad</a>’s plan to capture Kyiv in 72 hours.</p>



<p>But its failure wrecked his hopes of a rapid victory.</p>



<p>The blunder was revealed by the respected Rusi think-tank.</p>

<p>Ukrainian security forces also told how a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18279891/russian-soldiers-wife-rape-ukrainian-women-sickening-phone-call/">Russian soldier&#8217;s wife was recorded telling him to &#8220;rape Ukrainian women&#8221;</a> in a sickening intercepted phone call to the front line.</p>



<p>In the shocking clip, the&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;wife is heard telling her soldier husband that he is allowed to rape women in&nbsp;Ukraine, as long as he &#8220;uses protection&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t tell her about it when he gets home.</p>



<p>A woman&#8217;s voice is heard saying in the clip, shared by Ukrainian security services: &#8220;So yeah, do it over there. Ukrainian woman there. Rape them.&#8221;</p>



<p>She laughs before adding: &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me anything, understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>A man on the other end of the call replies: &#8220;So I should rape and not tell you anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman responds: &#8220;Yes, so that I wouldn&#8217;t know anything,&#8221; before both start laughing.</p>



<p>She then adds: &#8220;Just use protection,&#8221; before the man replies again: &#8220;OK.&#8221;</p>

<p>It comes as reports claim <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398930/vladimir-putin-generals-ukraine-war-disaster-coup/">Putin&#8217;s generals are turning on the tyrant</a> as their soldiers continue to be bogged down in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Senior figures in the Russian army and security services have become increasingly frustrated with Putin’s handling of the deadly war as a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; exploded in Moscow.</p>



<p>Ukraine estimated that more than 22,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of the war.</p>



<p>It is thought Putin&#8217;s generals want to be let off the leash to storm&nbsp;Ukraine&nbsp;&#8211; and even go to war with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a>&nbsp;after accusing the West of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">fighting a proxy war against Moscow</a>&nbsp;via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>The powerful Russian &#8220;siloviki&#8221; &#8211; or security bloc &#8211;&nbsp;have reportedly blamed Putin for a &#8220;serious error&#8221; after retreating from the capital Kyiv and concentrating on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">taking control of the Donbas in the east</a>.</p>



<p>Russia had expected it could march across Ukraine without much of a fight &#8211; but in reality, they have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance</a>.</p>



<p>Overnight, Russia bombed Kyiv with cruise missiles while the UN was on a visit to the capital.</p>



<p>One of the missiles hit a residential building near a defence plant, and the number of casualties was not immediately clear.</p>



<p>In a further sign of growing desperation from the Kremlin, it has been reported that Russian troops are plotting to steal food in occupied parts of Ukraine after Western sanctions sparked major shortages back home.</p>



<p>The plan, which evokes memories of Soviet dictator Stalin&#8217;s evil forced famine in Ukraine, was accidentally revealed by a Kremlin puppet parliament.</p>

<p>Dubbed the &#8220;Despicable Ten&#8221;, the men&#8217;s faces and names were released by Ukraine&#8217;s Ministry of Defence.</p>



<p>Among the 10 identified soldiers are Junior Sergeant Viacheslav Lavrentiev, a firefighter before the war, martial artist Private Grigoriy Naryshkin, and professional dancer Corporal Semen Maltsev.</p>



<p>A number of the group have reportedly continued to post on Facebook since the outbreak of war, including Private Vasiliy Kniazev, 24, who is said to have shared details of where the 64th Brigade was stationed in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Private Sergey Peskariov, 24, quit his job at a supermarket in November in anticipation of war with Ukraine.</p>



<p>Married Corporal Mikhail Kashin is said to have marked his birthday in Bucha by massacring civilians.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sergeant Nikita Akimov &#8211; who is said to have personally kidnapped and tortured Bucha civilians &#8211; has continued to post pictures of his young kids on Facebook.</p>

<p>&#8220;This unit [has] been awarded for its atrocities and returned to the battlefield. Justice for war criminals is inevitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just 10 days ago, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> chose to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18297520/putin-honours-army-unit-bucha-massacre/">honour the group blamed for the Bucha massacre</a>, presenting the 64th Brigade with awards for their &#8220;heroism and bravery&#8221;.</p>



<p>And the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18152525/russia-accused-genocide-bodies-streets-mass-graves-2/">commander of the Bucha &#8220;butchers&#8221;</a>, Lt Col Azatbek Omurbekov, was last week promoted to the rank of Colonel.</p>



<p>It has been revealed that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18180057/putins-butcher-of-bucha-rape-genocide-ukrainians-blessed-priest/">Omurbekov received a blessing from the Russian Orthodox Church</a> in November.</p>



<p>Months later, the troops he commanded are alleged to have massacred and tortured hundreds of Ukrainian civilians.</p>



<p>The men&#8217;s alleged identities were found after a joint investigation by the Prosecutor General&#8217;s office in Ukraine and the news agency Slidstvo.</p>

</ul>

<p>Speaking today, Ukraine&#8217;s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said: &#8220;We will not stop until we bring each of them to justice.&#8221;</p>



<p>All of the men named and pictured on Thursday are young &#8211; aged between 24 and 33 &#8211; and range in ranks from privates to sergeants to corporals.</p>



<p>Following the withdrawal from Bucha, they were moved to Belarus and then on to the western Russian border city of Belgorod.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18176011/russia-bucha-troops-back-to-warzone/">&#8220;Butchers of Bucha&#8221; are feared to have been redeployed to Ukraine</a>, and are said to be fighting in the eastern Donbas region, where most of the Russian army is now concentrated.</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18150183/bodies-ukraine-civilians-roads-russian-retreat/">400 corpses, many of them brutally mutilated</a> and tortured, were discovered in Bucha following the withdrawal of Russian troops.</p>

<p>Among the atrocities reportedly uncovered by Ukrainian forces were <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18164318/bucha-massacre-russian-war-crimes-ukraine/">&#8220;torture chambers&#8221; set up in basements</a> where civilians were executed by Putin&#8217;s soldiers.</p>



<p>Nine <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18255474/ukraine-war-russian-war-crimes-rape-women-pregnant-bucha/">women and girls in Bucha became pregnant</a> after being raped by Russian soldiers in the town.</p>



<p>It is believed that the &#8220;Despicable Ten&#8221; were supported in their massacres by the shadowy <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18199648/rusich-neo-nazi-mercenaries-collect-ears/">Wagner mercenaries</a>.</p>



<p>This feared neo-Nazi fighting force known as Putin&#8217;s private army has already been linked to a string of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14879449/putins-wagner-group-mercenaries/">war crimes around the world</a>.</p>



<p>Ukraine is said to be looking to defeat the 64th Brigade as a huge symbolic victory, similar to the sinking of the Moskva warship.</p>



<p>Russia continues to deny that any massacre took place in Bucha, and claims the images of mass graves and dead bodies were all faked.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the course of capturing the designated boundary, the enemy numbering up to a battalion was defeated, and more than 40 pieces of equipment destroyed,&#8221; the pro-Putin newspaper Red Star reported.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Nationalist unit lost all combat capability and was no longer involved in combat operations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Within three weeks, under the leadership of Colonel Omurbekov, brigade units at the occupied line repelled more than 50 attacks by the enemy using tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and heavy artillery.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ukrainian officials claim that the corpses of more than 1,000 civilians have been retrieved from around Kyiv and that French investigators are working with them to document alleged war crimes.</p>



<p>On Monday, it was revealed through forensic tests that many women were raped before being killed and dumped in mass graves.</p>



<p>A UN mission to Bucha has also documented &#8220;the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there,&#8221; according to the UN&#8217;s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>



<p>It comes as the Foreign Office confirmed a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">Brit fighter has been killed in Ukraine</a>, the first reported UK casualty since the start of the conflict.</p>



<p>British armed forces veteran and dad Scott Sibley, 36, died in fighting, as his former squadron paid tribute to a man with a &#8220;commando spirit&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can confirm that a British national has been killed in Ukraine and are supporting their family,&#8221; a Foreign, Development and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said.</p>

<p>BARBIE’S new outfit is out of this world as a pair of the dolls visit the International Space Station.</p>



<p>Their get-up evokes Jane Fonda’s cult 1968 sci-fi Barbarella.</p>

<p>They were blasted into orbit in a bid to encourage girls to pursue aerospace and STEM careers — and “reach for the stars”.</p>



<p>The dolls are modelled after NASA scientists Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.</p>



<p>Lisa McKnight, Global Head of Barbie and Dolls, said: &#8220;It is important that we encourage girls to reach for the stars and pursue careers in aerospace and STEM.</p>



<p>&#8220;With help from the International Space Station National Lab team, we are reminding girls that not even gravity can hold them back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Devastated friends and family paid tribute to a &#8220;beautiful guy inside and out&#8221;.</p>



<p>His friend Alex Darwin, who served with him, wrote on a Facebook post: &#8220;I’m in complete disbelief.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you &amp; to of experienced your kind nature. </p>



<p>&#8220;You were there for me, &amp; I will forever be grateful.</p>



<p>&#8220;One hell of a beautiful guy, inside &amp; out! Stand down, Scott Sibley.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another friend shared: &#8220;Scott Sibley you were a good friend, and funny as hell. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will be missed by everyone who ever met you that&#8217;s for sure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Until the big re-org in the sky brother. Stand down soldier, your duty is over. RIP, It&#8217;s our stag now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two Gofundme pages have been set up to help his family cover funeral costs.</p>



<p>One of them, set up by Craig Gant reads: &#8220;Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle.</p>



<p>&#8220;To me, he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.&#8221;</p>



<p>The second Gofundme page reads: &#8220;I know only a couple of us got to meet sibs outside of our community and many had arranged to meet him or couldn’t due to long distance, however each of us that had the pleasure of knowing sibs were affected by his contagious laugh and ability to cheer us up! (Or wind us up haha)</p>



<p>&#8220;We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways, if you would like to write anything with your donation feel free to do that his family can see how much he was loved by us all!</p>



<p>&#8220;Rest in peace Sibs we will never forget you&#8221;</p>



<p>The news follows the announcement that around 8,000 British troops are set to take part in exercises across Eastern Europe in a bid to combat Russian aggression.</p>



<p>This would be one of the largest British deployments since the Cold War.</p>



<p>Dozens of tanks will be deployed, from Finland in the north to North Macedonia in the south, in response to the ongoing military crisis in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The Queen&#8217;s Royal Hussars are set to be embedded into an armoured brigade in Finland, which shares an 830-mile land border with Russia.</p>



<p>Exercises will also take place alongside American troops in Poland.</p>



<p>Manoeuvers are scheduled to take place at least until June.</p>

<p>The Brit forces will be joined by tens of thousands of Nato and Joint Expeditionary Force troops.</p>



<p>This action had already been planned, but the Ministry of Defence said it had been enhanced in the wake of the war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse said: &#8220;The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression.</p>



<p>&#8220;The British Army&#8217;s series of exercises is fundamental to both.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British Army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century.&#8221;</p>



<p>Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: &#8220;The security of Europe has never been more important.</p>



<p>&#8220;These exercises will see our troops join forces with allies and partners across Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force in a show of solidarity and strength in one of the largest shared deployments since the Cold War.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as Brit volunteers Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28,  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">remain captured in Mariupol</a>.</p>



<p>Ex-squaddie Pinner was paraded by Russian state media in a chilling clip captioned: &nbsp;&#8220;Another mercenary was caught in Mariupol.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shaun Pinner is an English mercenary. He says that he no longer needs the war and he wants to go home. He won&#8217;t make it home.</p>



<p>&#8220;Captured Ukrainian soldiers testify about the atrocities of foreign mercenaries. And after the trial, they face the death penalty.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18265698/brit-fighter-captured-ukraine-first-pictures/">Pictures of Aslin</a> showing bruises and cuts on him, were shared online.</p>



<p>At the start of the invasion, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17895167/brit-fighting-ukraine-four-uk-fighters-missing/">a number of brave British soldiers</a> joined Ukraine in the fight against Putin.</p>

<p><strong>VLADIMIR Putin could declare a new world war within days, Britain’s Defence Secretary has warned.</strong></p>



<p>The warning comes after Russia claimed the invasion of Ukraine is likely to end in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18402754/russia-ukraine-invasion-threat-nuclear-world-war-putin/">nuclear world war</a>.</p>

<p>Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has warned that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">the Russian tyrant</a> might use traditional Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which commemorate the end of World War Two, to call up troops for a “war with the world’s Nazis”.</p>



<p>He also said Russia’s occupation of Ukraine risked becoming “a sort of cancerous growth” that must be cut out. </p>



<p>It comes after the editor of the state-owned broadcaster RT Margarita Simonyan said in a broadcast that it was “more probable” that the Russian President would launch a nuclear strike than allow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&nbsp;to lose the war.</p>



<p>And meanwhile, Putin paraded his military might through Moscow and St Petersburg in a rehearsal for the Victory Day.</p>

<p>Eager Russians took selfies with the military vehicles and troops &#8211;  even while thousands of their soldiers have been killed and hundreds of their tanks &amp; aircraft blown up in Ukraine. </p>



<p>Mr Wallace told LBC radio’s Nick Ferrari: “I would not be surprised . . . that he is probably going to declare on May Day that ‘We are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people’.”</p>



<p>He went on: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he&#8217;s got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.</p>



<p>“We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.” </p>

<p>Mr Wallace also said the UK would continue to supply weapons to the government in Kyiv and was looking at providing anti-ship missiles.</p>



<p>Western countries have been giving aid, weapons and equipment to the country &#8211; stopping short of sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone.</p>



<p>Britain has been supplying anti-tank weapons, anti-air missiles and plans to send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a>&nbsp;to help them fight against Russia.</p>



<p>Earlier this week Moscow <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386648/russia-threatens-strike-targets-britain/">threatened to strike military targets in the UK </a>with Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova&nbsp;saying the strikes could be authorised against Nato member states.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;Do we understand correctly that for the sake of disrupting the logistics of military supplies, Russia can strike military targets on the territory of those Nato countries that supply arms to the Kyiv regime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, this directly leads to deaths and bloodshed on Ukrainian territory. As far as I understand, Britain is one of those countries.”</p>



<p>Yesterday Moscow made more threats against the West.</p>



<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability.”</p>



<p>President Putin earlier insisted <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">any country intervening</a> in Russia’s “special operation” to rid Ukraine of so-called Nazis faced a “lightning-fast” response.</p>



<p>The Russian leader warned his country would use their weapons against anyone who &#8220;intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside,&#8221; referring to his<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18326876/putins-arsenal-superweapons-laser-canon-poseidon/">&nbsp;six superweapons</a>&nbsp;including the deadly Sarmat missile, &nbsp;dubbed &#8220;Satan 2.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Mr Wallace said he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;rattled&#8221; by the tyrant&#8217;s threats adding that Nato forces “outnumber and outgun” Russia.</p>



<p>He told LBC Radio: &#8220;I don’t feel rattled by it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because we have strong Armed Forces and a nuclear deterrent and we’re part of a Nato partnership of 30 nations who outgun him, outnumber him and have potentially all the capabilities at our disposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t fear him. I think we should be very grateful in this country that we have a nuclear deterrent, I think that is a really important part of his calculations.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are many, as we know, who wanted to get rid of it over the years.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m very grateful that somewhere under the sea, some amazing men and women are deep underwater, hiding, waiting, in case Britain needs to be protected. That’s important.&#8221;</p>



<p>Previously Russia&#8217;s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/">warned that the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221;</a> with British and Nato weapons being already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he claimed&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a>&nbsp;at all costs.</p>



<p>Fears over a possible nuclear strike were sparked last week after Russia&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">test-fired its nuclear missile Sarmat 2</a>&nbsp;with Putin boasting it had the capability of being able to strike anywhere on earth and couldn’t be stopped by existing missile defences.</p>

<p>In the capital city of a country renowned for its highly technical martial arts scene, amateur fighters gather regularly promising to exchange only blood and bruises in the underground club.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here you don&#8217;t have to know how to fight. You just need to have heart and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; club co-founder Chana Worasart told AFP.</p>



<p>The 30-year-old founded the club in 2016, partly inspired by cult Brad Pitt movie Fight Club, to allow amateur fighters to test their skills &#8211; or just vent their aggression.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I think the popularity is due to a variety of occupations and fighting styles that are different from the styles in the (professional) ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s certainly the appeal for the 23-year-old contestant and grocery store owner Surathat Sakulchue.</p>



<p>Fighters are expected to use all four limbs to dish out and absorb punishment, and are &#8220;quite different&#8221; to traditional Muay Thai fights, he explained.</p>



<p>He added that &#8220;fighting with containers surrounding us is just fun and exciting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unlike the movie&#8217;s famous line banning fighters from talking about their club to outsiders, the Bangkok-based outfit calls itself &#8220;the ring that will change violence into friendship&#8221;.</p>



<p>The group has become a local sensation, with a private Facebook group racking up 73,000 members as word spread of the underground matches.</p>



<p>Fighters are allowed to go all-out in a single three-minute round &#8212; with neither a winner nor loser declared &#8212; but the bouts aren&#8217;t quite no-holds-barred.</p>



<p>Elbowing, grappling, throwing opponents to the ground and punching to the back of the head are strictly prohibited.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the gatherings have not escaped the notice of the Thai police.</p>



<p>Authorities were alerted in 2016 to the underground matches &#8211; which allegedly violated the Boxing Act and are punishable with a one-year jail sentence and fines of up to about $600.</p>



<p>But despite a small police presence on occasion, the fights have continued.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the club insists it is not governed by the Boxing Act at all, meaning organisers are not holding unsanctioned fights.</p>



<p>Co-founder Chana says the group is approved by the Department of Provincial Administration.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t oppose the idea of turning this into legal, sanctioned fights, but at the same time, we can&#8217;t lose the underground identity, so the question is &#8216;where is the balance?'&#8221;</p>

<p>It is all a far cry from the scrappy club&#8217;s beginnings when there were no clear rules.</p>



<p>Now there are fighting guidelines, screening procedures, a risk-acceptance pledge as well as protective equipment and on-scene medical care.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t ask fighters to kill each other. If you&#8217;re too tired or too injured to go on, then we&#8217;ll stop the fight,&#8221; said Chana as another bout began.</p>



<p>After paying his respects with folded hands and touching gloves with his opponent, amateur fighter Ilya Ostroushchenko got to work.</p>



<p>Landing a kick to his opponent&#8217;s torso, Ostroushchenko bashed out a combination of punches &#8211; and a left hook to the face finally sent his opponent stumbling to the rubber mat.</p>

<p>A BRITISH tourist was left covered in blood after fighting a knife-wielding BOXER who allegedly stole his bag on a beach.</p>



<p>Fraser William Cowen, 23, was paddling in the sea with friends when he saw the thug run off with his belongings in Krabi, southern <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/thailand/">Thailand</a>, on Sunday.</p>

<p>He sprinted after Suwit Puengsom &#8211; a former professional Muay Thai boxer &#8211; as he was trying to make a getaway on a motorcycle.</p>



<p>And brave Fraser is seen on CCTV video footage leaping at the thief and wrestling him to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They went toe-to-toe while grappling with each other before the martial arts expert bit Fraser&#8217;s thumb, pulled out a knife and made off with the bag.</p>



<p>Fraser, from Plymouth, Devon, was covered in cuts following the scrap &#8211; but still cracked a smile while recovering at the police station.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said: &nbsp;&#8220;I’d had quite a few drinks so I wasn’t really thinking. If I was, I might not have chased after him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw him take my stuff and I thought ‘hang on, I’m not letting him get away with that&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was more like an act of stupidity rather than bravery.&nbsp; I just ran after him.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I’d known the thief was a boxer with a knife I probably wouldn&#8217;t have done it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just ran over and kind of dived at the motorbike. I actually headbutted the bike which knocked him to the ground.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were going toe-to-toe fighting for about two minutes. We were wrestling and I was just trying to overpower him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had hold of my bag to stop him from leaving then he bit my thumb. I was like ‘Oi, bro, let go of my thumb’.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then he pulled out a knife and was waving it around. He cut the strap of the bag and then ran away.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was just pure animal instinct that took over. I was hardly thinking.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fraser said the bag had cash, credit cards, a phone, and hotel keys in it, but he said the local police were quick to react.</p>



<p>They arrested Suwit, 31, on Tuesday and he admitted stealing the Brit&#8217;s bag at the Ao Nang beach in the early hours of the morning.</p>



<p>Fraser added: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t afraid. I just wanted to stop him from taking my stuff.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really grateful for how fast the police caught the thief. I can&#8217;t thank them enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>Police Colonel Somsak Thongkliang said: &#8220;Suwit still had an injury on his right knee while trying to escape from the tourist.</p>

<p>&#8220;The suspect was a famous Thai boxer with the nickname Den-Saenchai. We have already detained him and brought him to Ao Nang police station for further legal proceedings.&#8221;</p>



<p>The suspect was remanded in custody and is due to appear in court today.</p>

<p>RUSSIA has warned its invasion of Ukraine is likely to end in a nuclear world war, adding “we’re all going to die someday”.</p>



<p>The latest chilling statement came from Margarita Simonyan, editor of the state-owned broadcaster RT, who is a high-profile mouthpiece for the Kremlin.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18403348" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729240111.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403348" width="960" height="384" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Russian State Media</figcredit></figure>Margarita Simonyan has issued the latest threat about a nuclear world war[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18403193" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728986153-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403193" width="960" height="621" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Russia test-fired its new Sarmat 2 nuclear missile recently[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18403209" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727623034-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403209" width="960" height="665" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been issuing his own threats to the West[/caption]



<p>In a broadcast last night it said it was “more probable” that President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> would launch a nuclear strike than allow <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> to lose the war.</p>



<p>Simonyan said: “Either we lose in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> or the Third World War starts. I think <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-3/">World War Three</a> is more realistic, knowing us, knowing our leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most incredible outcome, that all this will end with a nuclear strike, seems more probable to me than the other course of events.</p>



<p>“This is to my horror on one hand,” she told a panel of experts, “but on the other hand, it is what it is. We will go to heaven, while they will simply croak&#8230; We&#8217;re all going to die someday.”</p>

<p>Simonyan’s statements comes close on the heels of a number of threats issued in the past 48 hours from fellow propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, Sergei Lavrov, the country&#8217;s foreign minister and Putin himself.</p>



<p>While those threats have been dismissed by both the US and the UK as mere bluster, fears of an all-out war using nuclear armaments are a realistic possibility as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine falters as it continues to meet fierce opposition.</p>



<p>Concerns over a possible nuclear strike from Russia were also raised after it <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">test-fired its nuclear missile Sarmat 2</a> last week, with Putin boasting it had the capability of being able to strike anywhere on earth and couldn’t be stopped by existing missile defences.</p>



<p>Lavrov first raised the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18375080/nuclear-world-war-real-danger-britain-nato-target/">possibility of launching nuclear weapons</a> during an interview on Russian state TV on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on whether the current standoff between east and west could be compared to the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War, he said the situation was even more dangerous.</p>



<p>He explained this was because the weapons involved now were more powerful, the controls on them more lax, and communication between the two sides is non-existent.</p>



<p>Lavrov said: “During the Cuban Missile Crisis there were not many ‘written’ rules. But the rules of conduct were clear enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Moscow understood how Washington was behaving. Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left.”</p>



<p>When asked about the threat of nuclear war, he added: “The risks are very significant. I do not want the danger to be artificially inflated [but] it is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated.”</p>



<p>That was followed by remarks, seemingly made off-the-cuff, by Solovyev while discussing with the head of the Roscomos space agency the deployment of Sarmat 2.</p>



<p>“As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,” Solovyov said, implying the UK deserved to be obliterated because it has become “<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/">totally boorish</a>,” in a possible reference to the UK’s support of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, said 46 of the missiles will be constructed with the first deployed to units in&nbsp;Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, later this year.</p>



<p>“Everything is according to plan with us,” he said. “It is all according to plan.”</p>



<h2 id="threat-of-lightning-fast-response">THREAT OF &#8216;LIGHTNING-FAST&#8217; RESPONSE</h2>



<p>Putin then followed that with a threat of his own, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">vowing a “lightning-fast” response</a> to any country who directly intervened in the conflict.</p>



<p>During a meeting of lawmakers in St Petersburg he said: “If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia.</p>



<p>“They must know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning-fast. Fast.</p>



<p>“We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won’t brag about them. But we will use them.”</p>



<p>While Putin did not directly mention the use of nuclear weapons, it would seem he was making a reference to the Sarmat missile.</p>



<p>His remarks, echo ones he made at the start of the “special military operation” in February when he warned that any country seeking to interfere would face consequences “never seen before in their history”.</p>



<p>It comes as state media has also been playing up the prospect of a world conflict, claiming that Russia was now engaged in a conflict with NATO.</p>



<h2 id="they-declared-a-war">&#8216;THEY DECLARED A WAR&#8217;</h2>



<p>State TV host Olga Skabeeva, said on Tuesday that a summit in Germany involving 40 defence ministers held to coordinate arms deliveries to Ukraine amounted to a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386648/russia-threatens-strike-targets-britain/">declaration of war</a>.</p>



<p>“They declared a war,” she told viewers. “World War III, no longer just a special operation, with 40 countries against us.”</p>



<p>Political scientist Mikhail Markelov, agreed, adding that those 40 countries were “today’s collective Hitler”.</p>



<p>That view was shared by another state media personality Dmitry Kulikov, who said: “This is a big war. The West declared it against us.</p>



<p>“Let’s be worthy of our predecessors, everyone who lived through that. What made us think that our lives should be better than those of our grandparents?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why should we be free of our historical mission?”</p>



<p>At the start of the war many experts predicted the conflict would only last a matter of days or weeks, with Russian forces sweeping in to take control and replace the existing Ukrainian government with a regime loyal to Moscow.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18401077" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AP-MAP-RUSSIAN-ADVANCES-EAST-OF-UKRAINE-APR-28-v2-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18401077" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kherson is the only major Ukrainian city to fall to Russian forces, so far</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>But 62 days later Russia is struggling and having failed to take Kyiv it has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">refocused its forces in the Donbas region</a>.</p>



<p>So far, Kherson, on the Black Sea coast, is the only major city to fall into Russia’s hands.</p>



<p>Western allies have rallied behind Ukraine with both the US and UK promising to send weapons and arms.</p>



<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declared earlier this week that Ukraine will be supplied all the weapons it needs to “win” the war and “weaken” Russia.</p>



<p>In a speech last night, UK defence secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/liz-truss/">Liz Truss</a> said arms deliveries will “keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine”.</p>



<p>That would mean not only re-taking the parts of Ukraine Russia has occupied since the invasion but also re-taking the areas attacked and annexed since 2014, namely Crimea and rebel-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>

<p>Ms Truss said the war could last for 10 years, but the West must be ready “for the long haul”.</p>



<p>She warned if Putin was successful in his military objective, then there would be “untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe”.</p>

<p>Brodie shared the footage to his 1million Instagram followers and on his YBS Youngbloods YouTube channel.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tiger shark and this turtle &#8211; big showdown, and I&#8217;m right in the thick of it,&#8221; he is heard saying.</p>



<p>The massive shark is seen thrashing near the surface as the writhing turtle tries to escape its jaws.</p>



<p>The chase continues alongside and under his board in the ocean off Western Australia.</p>

<p>At one point Brodie spots the danger as he finds himself in the middle between predator and prey.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh this is intense, they&#8217;re underneath me,&#8221; Brodie says.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in the best position right here. Oh, I&#8217;m between a tiger and a turtle. Uh oh!&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment the shark lunges out of the water and sinks its teeth into his board.</p>

<p>Brodie crashes into his water along with his camera, which falls to the seabed.</p>



<p>He is able to reach it and it captures his face as he swims back to the surface seconds later.</p>



<p>Thankfully he was unharmed in the close encounter.</p>



<p>He wrote alongside the video on Instagram: &#8220;A humbling reminder for myself that it’s their ocean and I’m just a visitor!</p>



<p>&#8220;I love sharks and this little accident was not the big fellas fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ocean enthusiast Brodie, 32, has built a large fan base with videos of him camping and fishing along the Western Australia coast.</p>



<p>In 2019 he quit his job as an electrician to become a full-time YouTuber.</p>



<p>He <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-17/brodie-youngbloods-moss-quits-job-to-become-a-youtuber/11391924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told ABC</a>: &#8220;I started making enough money to cover my bills and in the end, my full-time job as an electrician was getting in the way of being a YouTuber.</p>



<p>&#8220;(Quitting) was kind of spooky. I had bills to pay, I had a mortgage and a full-time job.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was pretty narrow-minded, I thought that I had to have a full-time job, that there wasn&#8217;t much money to make on social media.&#8221;</p>



<p>It paid off and he now makes much more from his sun-soaked adventures than he did as a tradie.</p>



<p>His videos &#8211; also featuring his dog, girlfriend and members of his family &#8211; regularly rack up millions of views.</p>



<p>Many show close encounters with sharks, whales, turtles and sea snakes.</p>



<p>Western Australia is one of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16671715/australia-shark-attack-map-maulings-year/">the world&#8217;s hot spots for shark attacks</a> on humans.</p>



<p>In November 2020 a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13265338/man-savaged-shark-bodyboarding-australia/">bodyboarder was savaged to death</a> near Broome, the eighth fatal attack that year.</p>



<p>A year later Brit dad Paul Millachip was mauled to death while swimming in Freemantle.</p>



<p>There were claims he was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16674023/australia-shark-attack-great-white-tiger/">attacked by a great white and a tiger shark</a> at the same time.</p>

<p>RUSSIA has used trained dolphins in a desperate bid to protect its naval fleet.</p>



<p>Moscow has deployed two dolphin pods at its naval base at Sevastopol after the<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/"> flagship Moskva&nbsp;was sunk by Ukraine</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>According to satellite images analysed by the <a href="https://news.usni.org/2022/04/27/trained-russian-navy-dolphins-are-protecting-black-sea-naval-base-satellite-photos-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Naval Institute </a>(USNI), the two dolphin pods were moved to the Black Sea base in February at the start of Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dolphins could be deployed for counter-dive operations and to block Ukrainian forces from entering the harbour. </p>



<p>Sevastopol is the Russian Navy&#8217;s most crucial naval base, where a large number of ships are anchored which means they are vulnerable to underwater attacks.</p>



<p>Russia is known for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10714396/iran-fleet-russian-killer-dolphins/">training dolphins for military purposes</a> in the past, using them to attack foreign ships with mines.</p>

<p>The highly-intelligent animals were even trained to swim up to enemy boats with mines strapped to them, blowing holes in the ships &#8211; and themselves.</p>



<p>Both the US and Soviet Union trained military dolphins throughout the Cold War.</p>



<p>The Soviet Union navy had a number of marine mammal programmes including dolphin training at  Kazachya Bukhta near Sevastopol.</p>



<p>Bottlenose dolphins were trained in the 1970s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1617744/us-navy-spent-years-trying-to-turn-dumb-sharks-into-lethal-cold-war-suicide-bombers/">to carry out marine missions</a>.</p>

<p>The mammals were capable of planting bombs on ships and attacking divers with guns strapped to their heads.</p>



<p>The dolphin unit moved to Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union but barely stayed open.</p>



<p>It returned to action when it went under Russian control following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3702892/russia-plans-to-deploy-a-fleet-of-deadly-military-whales-to-guard-its-navy-bases-and-take-on-underwater-warfare-roles/">Moscow&#8217;s controversial annexation of the Crimea</a>&nbsp;in 2014.</p>



<p>A source told Russian news agency RIA Novosti at the time: &#8220;Our specialists developed new devices that convert dolphins’ underwater sonar detection of targets into a signal to the operator’s monitor.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Ukrainian navy lacked funds for such know-how, and some projects had to be mothballed.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was later revealed that a number of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6316633/ukraine-army-dolphin-spies-hunger-strike-captured-russia/">dolphins died as they refused to eat or follow orders</a> provided by the Russians.</p>



<p>Borys Babin, the Ukrainian government&#8217;s representative in Crimea, said the dolphins went on a hunger strike when they were seized by &#8220;Russian invaders&#8221;.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin&#8217;s top generals are said to be turning on the weak and sickly tyrant over the shambolic Ukraine invasion as fears of a palace coup mount. </p>



<p>Senior figures in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> army and security services have become increasingly frustrated with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin’s</a> handling of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a> as a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; explodes in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a>.</p>

<p>It is thought the army generals want to be let off the leash to storm <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> &#8211; and even go to war with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a> after accusing the West of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">fighting a proxy war against Moscow</a> via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>The powerful Russian &#8220;siloviki&#8221; &#8211; or security bloc &#8211;&nbsp;have reportedly blamed Putin for a &#8220;serious error&#8221; after retreating from the capital of Kyiv and concentrating on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">taking control of the Donbas in the east</a>.</p>



<p>Russia had expected it could march across Ukraine without much of a fight &#8211; but in reality they have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance.</a></p>



<p>Putin stupidly had believed victory was possible in a matter of days, but the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236387/russia-unleash-white-phosphorus-ukraine/">war has instead been raging for weeks</a>.</p>

<p>And his troops have been hit by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18032931/russian-soldier-complains-of-frostbite-and-victory-parade/">plummeting morale</a>&nbsp;after the quick triumph promised by the tyrant turned into a bloodbath.</p>



<p>Ukraine is now littered with the burnt out wrecks of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles, charred remains of downed aircraft, and the dead&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18032566/putin-loses-fifth-colonel-in-ukraine-invasion-russia/">bodies of soldiers</a>&nbsp;&#8211; many of who were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18037016/putin-ghost-buses-shipping-russian-bodies-belarus/">teenage conscripts</a>.</p>



<p>The Russian death toll has reached as high as 17,000 with several generals and other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18032566/putin-loses-fifth-colonel-in-ukraine-invasion-russia/">top commanders&nbsp;</a>among those killed.</p>



<p>Last month, Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces out of Kyiv and managed to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles east of the capital in a major victory.</p>

<p>The Kremlin declared that the first stage of its campaign to “denazify and demilitarise” Ukraine was a success despite the retreat of Russian troops &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18067717/russia-defeated-kremlin-focus-only-liberating-separatists/">and it&#8217;ll now focus its efforts on breakaway province Donetsk.</a></p>



<p>The mounting frustration from Russia&#8217;s top army and intelligence chiefs over the war also comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/">rumours swirl around the state of Putin&#8217;s physical health</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s thought the Russian dictator could now face an uprising from his inner circle amid the unprecedented criticism and growing demand for “all-out war&#8221; and &#8220;mobilisation&#8221;.</p>



<p>Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov told The Center for European Policy Analysis: &#8220;Does it matter? It matters a lot. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is the very first time the siloviki are putting distance between themselves and the president. Which opens up all sorts of possibilities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin is already bracing for a possible military coup after he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18242246/putin-military-coup-purging-spies-ukraine/">purged 150 spies over the invasion</a> of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The mad tyrant launched a &#8220;Stalinist&#8221; purge of his intelligence services &#8211; including sending spy chief Sergei Beseda to prison.</p>



<p>But the FSB is reportedly still pushing for hardline military action in Ukraine despite the jailing of its top boss.</p>



<p>And Alexander Arutyunov, a veteran Russian Spetsnaz&nbsp;officer, shared a video in pro-military groups pleading with Putin to escalate the war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn them into Moon craters so that not a single plane with a Bayraktar [military drone] can take off.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must destroy all their railway lines with missiles of such big size that they spend years&nbsp;repairing&nbsp;them…</p>



<p>&#8220;If I understand it, why don’t your top guys get it? This is beyond me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Margarita Simonyan, head of RT &#8211; the Kremlin propaganda media network &#8211; also hit out at the UK for suggesting its weapons supplies for Ukraine could be used to target Russian territory.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;The Anglo-Saxons are publicly suggesting that Ukraine should transfer the fighting to Russian territory.</p>



<p>&#8220;And supplying it with the means to carry out this plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What choice do you leave us, idiots? The complete annihilation of the remaining Ukraine?&nbsp;A nuclear strike?&#8221;</p>



<p>Russia analyst&nbsp;Alexey Muraviev has previously warned that Putin faces a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18141050/vladimir-putin-ousted-two-years/">potential coup</a> from within his military and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Mr Muraviev told Sky News Australia that the coup may come as they want to try and win the war &#8211; not to stop aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I think that there have been tensions between Russia and the intelligence community and Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because clearly, there&#8217;s been a clear error of judgment that was made and it was probably driven by Putin himself about the situation in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;About the initial planning and the initial phase of the invasion where the Russian military naturally assume that they&#8217;re going there as liberators rather than the invaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that sort of false narrative was presented to them by the Supreme Commander in Chief, and when it fired back when the Russians began taking heavy casualties, Putin began quietly blaming the security services.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which I don&#8217;t think went really well also because he&#8217;s coming from within the security apparatus.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>RUSSIA has managed to keep its leader under strict control in a bid to hide his poor health.</p>



<p>It is of the utmost importance for Kremlin to maintain Vladimir Putin&#8217;s strongman image.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18393323" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728844706.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18393323" width="960" height="580" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Kremlin has been desperately trying to hide Putin&#8217;s health problems[/caption]

<p>Moscow has remained tight-lipped as over the past few years Putin has made periodic disappearances from public life, what appearances he makes are carefully stage managed, and there are reportedly even time limits on his meetings with ministers. </p>



<p>The Russian tyrant&#8217;s health has long been the source of speculation, with Western intelligence suggesting he has <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1832396/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">serious health issues</a> such as cancer and Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Russian officials have always denied the claims there is something wrong with their leader.</p>



<p>But despite Putin&#8217;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov insisting that Mad Vlad&#8217;s health is &#8220;excellent&#8221;, his recent public appearances have<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/"> sparked rumours about his physical state</a>.</p>

<p>The despot seems always surrounded by security, following a detailed programme and only attending a small number of meetings- for a short time.</p>



<p>It appears that every bit of the dictator&#8217;s life has been carefully planned, only feeding speculations about his health.</p>



<p>He is believed to be followed by a team of doctors who carefully monitor his health &#8211; with him due to turn 70 in October. </p>



<p>The Russian leader was seen trembling in resurfaced footage as he greeted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belarus/">Belarusian</a>&nbsp;President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15064105/who-belarus-president-alexander-lukashenko/">Alexander Lukashenko</a>.</p>

<p>Video showed frail-looking Putin holding his hand out to greet Lukashenko before quickly retracting and walking around the room.</p>



<p>And on Sunday, the Russian President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18356517/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-health-rumours-easter/">was seen biting his lips and appearing unsteady </a>during a midnight mass for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13820228/easter-date-year/">Orthodox Easter</a>, fuelling rumours the Parkinson&#8217;s rumours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But viewers saw the ageing autocrat appearing to shift uncomfortably, sticking out his tongue and chewing his lips.</p>



<p>Previously, Putin was seen slouched, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping a table and tapping his foot</a>&nbsp;during a meeting with his defence chief.</p>



<p>The tyrant appears with a bloated face, constantly tapping his foot and with his hand gripping the edge of the table for the entire 12-minute meeting.</p>



<p>Putin has long prided himself on his &#8220;strongman&#8221; image but his dramatic change over the past few years has caused speculation that he<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17981023/vladimir-putin-body-language-disease-symptoms/">&nbsp;may be suffering from a severe physical illness</a>.</p>



<p>Experts have pointed out that he looks &#8220;bloated&#8221; and &#8220;weakened&#8221; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18133008/chilling-new-clues-putin-thyroid-cancer-parkinsons/">has even seen a doctor who specialises in Thyroid cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Back in November 2020, political analyst Valery Solovei claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13253481/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">Putin underwent surgery</a> and indicated that Mad Vlad&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17806903/does-vladimir-putin-have-parkinsons-disease/">suffering from symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</a></p>



<p>And now an investigation has noted how in the past years Kremlin appears to have a tighter grip on Putin&#8217;s schedule.</p>



<p>The report by investigative <a href="https://www.proekt.media/en/investigation-en/putin-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proekt media</a> states that in his first days as a head of state the tyrant paid little attention to minor health issues such as fever. </p>



<p>An official recalled that &#8220;he&nbsp;could only postpone a&nbsp;meeting until the evening if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;severe infection.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was crucial for Kremlin to maintain the leader&#8217;s image that they did not mention any health problems at all, including sports injuries. </p>



<p>The only time there has been a mention of his health was last year when Putin himself admitted falling off a horse</p>



<p>He said at the time: &#8220;They were once filming me, I was training, and it happened that the horse stopped in front of a barrier and I did a somersault, literally a somersault.&#8221;</p>

<p>The concerns about the Russian President&#8217;s health appear to have started in November 2012, as he had a number of business trips and long-distance flights cancelled.</p>



<p>The report notes that back on November 4, 2012, on National Unity Day, state media did not include Putin in the footage of the ceremony on Red Square. </p>



<p>The reason was the president&#8217;s noticeable limp. </p>



<p>After a few months, Kremlin proceeded to cancel Putin&#8217;s official flights while in December of that year, all events were limited to an hour as the dictator could not sit down for longer for health reasons.</p>



<p>Even a concert at the Bolshoi Theater was shortened for Mad Vlad and then Putin was unable to meet the Japanese Prime Minister with Kremlin officials claiming &#8220;the chief is&nbsp;not well, wears a&nbsp;corset, and generally needs back surgery.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="mysterious-disappearances">MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES</h3>



<p>As time went by, a series of mysterious disappearances sparked speculations about the Russian ruler as Kremlin was able to cover them by using pre-recorded footage.</p>



<p>In 2015, the dictator vanished for eleven days with Kremlin giving no explanation for his absence.</p>



<p>When asked about his disappearance after his return Putin joked: &#8220;It would be boring without gossip.&#8221;</p>



<p>In November of the following year, the Russian leader disappeared again for a few days while Kremlin published pre-recorded footage of him, according to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/questioning-vladimir-putins-health-and-past-unexplained-disappearances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National review</a>.</p>



<p>Two years later in February 2018, Putin cancelled public events but admitted he &#8220;had a cold.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the start of the pandemic in 2020, he made only a few rare public appearances while in September 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16133486/vladimir-putin-self-isolate-covid/">he went into &#8220;self-isolation&#8221;</a>&nbsp;and attended all the events via video links.</p>



<p>Public appearances and meetings with world leaders in recent months have also been bizarre &#8211; with Putin often seated at a massively long table.</p>



<p>Some have speculated its an attempt to project power, but others have suggested its an extreme example of social distancing and paranoia. </p>



<p>It has also been reported that a group of medics regularly follow Putin, especially in Sochi which he prefers to Moscow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin appeared confused and out of breath as he wheezed his way through his latest speech, threatening the West with nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian president</a> seemed to struggle to catch his breath and paused several times during the address to politicians, stumbling over his words and looking exhausted.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18397622" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 763px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/putin1-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=753" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18397622" width="753" height="676" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin appeared to stutter during his most recent speech</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_18397624" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 531px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/putin2-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=521" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18397624" width="521" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">At another stage, he seemed breathless</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_18397626" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 656px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/putin3.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=646" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18397626" width="646" height="716" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">He gasped as he took several long pauses during the address</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>At one stage, he appears breathless and stuttering, while on two other occasions, he seems to take quick gasps for air.</p>



<p>However, if his delivery to politicians in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> city of St Petersburg was low-energy, his words were anything but.</p>



<p>In his fiery address, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">Putin warned he would use nukes against the West</a> if it interferes in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">conflict</a> in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to lawmakers he said: &#8220;If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must know that our response to counterstrikes will be lightning fast. Fast.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also said that Russia&#8217;s military wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to use its most <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/">modern weaponry</a> in an escalation of the war of words between <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> and the West.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have all the weapons we need for this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won’t brag about them.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we will use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time questions have been raised about the health of the 69-year-old Russian leader.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, a video seemed to show <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383848/putin-limping-meeting-un-chief/">Putin limp and grimace</a> as he walked during talks in Moscow with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>



<p>He also brought back his ludicrously long 13-foot table for the two-person talks, having previously used it as a Covid-19 precaution.</p>



<p>Another resurfaced clip purports to show <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/">Putin&#8217;s hand shaking uncontrollably</a> as he met his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belarus/">Belarusian</a> counterpart Alexander Lukashenko.</p>



<p>A frail-looking <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18356517/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-health-rumours-easter/">Putin appeared unsteady during a recent Easter service</a> in Moscow, as he was seen biting his lips and fidgeting in the cathedral.</p>



<p>The Kremlin was later accused of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18363674/vladimir-putin-fake-easter-service-parkinsons/">faking the Russian president&#8217;s appearance</a> by using digitally altered images from last year&#8217;s Easter event.</p>

<p>Last week, during talks with his defence minister Sergey Shoigu, the elderly tyrant was filmed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping the table and slouching</a>, sparking further rumours he may be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s Disease.</p>



<p>Kremlin officials have always denied there is anything wrong with their leader, who turns 70 in October.</p>



<p>Professor Erik&nbsp;Bucy, a body language expert from Texas Tech University, told The Sun Online upon watching the video: &#8221;&nbsp;It’s an astonishingly weakened Putin compared to the man we observed even a few years ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;An able-bodied president would not need to keep himself propped up with a hand held out for leverage and would not be concerned about keeping both feet planted on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes after Putin&#8217;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18375080/nuclear-world-war-real-danger-britain-nato-target/">nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger</a>.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s crony claimed in a chilling message that British and Nato weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in Ukraine, and accused the West of fighting a proxy war against Moscow through its support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Russian leader&#8217;s paranoia is said to be growing out of control, with an expert claiming he is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18308066/warmongering-putin-psychosis-hearing-voices-inside-head-lockdown/">hearing voices inside his head</a>.</p>



<p>Putin has reportedly been avoiding close contact with others and meets only those in his inner circle after they have been forced to quarantine in hotels for two weeks.</p>



<p>It is said that some guests have even been made to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/996603/inside-disinfectant-tunnel-putin-protect-him-coronavirus/">walk through an elaborate disinfectant-spraying tunnel</a>.</p>



<p>Putin has been isolating himself since the start of the pandemic which might have caused &#8220;irreversible psychological&#8221; damage and even led to his decision to invade Ukraine, psychotherapist Noel McDermott&nbsp;has claimed.</p>



<p>The experts explained that spending a long period of time in isolation could have a great impact on a person&#8217;s mental health, cause their brain to become &#8220;broken&#8221; and even make them take drastic decisions.</p>



<p>Putin has also looked to retaliate against the UK following the punishing sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs by a number of Western countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Russia slapped more than 200 current and former British MPs with sanctions, while also cutting natural gas off to two Nato countries, Bulgaria and Poland.</p>



<p>Europe has accused Russia of using the threat of cutting off natural gas supplies as &#8220;blackmail&#8221;.</p>

<p>The country&#8217;s government warns the attacks in the Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria are an attempt to escalate tensions and justify an invasion.</p>

<p>A DAD’S birthday surprise backfired when his superhero costume reduced terrified kids to tears.</p>



<p>Footage shows him enter a room dressed as Ultraman when one son began crying in his high chair and another lad, also in a superhero suit, hid behind a woman.</p>

<p>Another woman filming the event, thought to be their aunt Ms Chen, rushes over to catch the boy that has climbed from the seat.</p>



<p>She unsuccessfully tried to put <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/16892086/cruel-parents-traumatise-kids-grinch-christmas/">the terrified youngster</a> back but he refuses and tries to escape, holding onto her and crying.</p>



<p>The other boy starts crying too, so the woman takes him from the seat, while the first boy, now on the floor hides behind her.</p>



<p>She then burst out laughing at the Ultraman walked towards the terrified kids.</p>

<p>A second video shows her kneeling and still holding the boy, while the other one continues hiding behind her. </p>



<p>At one moment, the frightened boy runs crying towards Ms Chen.</p>



<p>The parents planned to take a photo of the Ultraman with both children but  the children were too afraid.</p>



<p>Ultraman is a Japanese superhero and the main character in the Ultraman TV series who has great fighting skills that like superman, he uses to protect the universe.</p>

<p>The incident happened in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">Chinese</a> city of Huizhou in the Chinese province of Guangdong last Tuesday.</p>



<p>Last year <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/15838999/kids-traumatised-epic-fail-mum-hire-replacement-elsa-birthday-party/">kids were left screaming when parents hired a Bigfoot character guest</a> when plans to for a Frozen birthday party fell through.</p>



<p>Horrified children at the sixth birthday soiree were left in tears when the hairy mythical creature showed up at the door instead of the Disney princess.</p>



<p>The Oklahoma-based mum had been forced to switch the party theme after having issues with the cake.</p>



<p>The parents decided to invite Mrs Bigfoot to the party instead &#8211; but it didn’t not go down well at all.</p>

<p>In a bid to make the furry beast less intimidating, the mum and dad had asked Bigfoot to wear a blue tutu, a bow and bring balloons.</p>



<p>However, this was clearly not enough, and all hell broke loose when the character arrived at the home.</p>

<p>RUSSIAN oligarchs&#8217; seized superyachts could be yours for a knock-down price, provided you have a few tens of millions burning a hole in your pocket.</p>



<p>Tango, a 255-foot <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/yachts/">megayacht</a> owned by sanctioned <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, is likely to be sold off at auction as it costs so much to run.</p>

<p>The lavish vessel, worth an estimated £70 million, was seized by the US Department of Justice earlier this month in Palma de Mallorca, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/">Spain</a>.</p>



<p>Despite first being sanctioned by the US in 2018 Vekselberg, according to the DOJ, used &#8220;US dollar payments through US banks&#8221; to buy and maintain the boat.</p>



<p>This money also covered mooring fees and rooms at a luxury <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/maldives/">Maldives</a> resort.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18269284/alisher-usmanovs-superyacht-seized-germany/">Russian oligarchs have been fleeing in their yachts</a> to &#8220;sanctions safe havens&#8221; and beefing up their security in the wake of an international clampdown on Kremlin-friendly billionaires.</p>

<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17928837/russian-oligarch-yacht-seized-sanctions/">world&#8217;s largest sailing yacht worth £450m was seized</a> by Italian police after its owner, Andrey Melnichenko, was placed on an EU sanctions list.</p>



<p>The seizure of Tango was part of Task Force KleptoCapture, a US bid to go after Russian individuals&#8217; assets for enabling the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war</a> with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p>However, maintaining such a lavish vessel and keeping it seaworthy, while the DOJ looks to charge Vekselberg with bank fraud, money laundering, and sanctions violations, doesn&#8217;t come cheap.</p>



<p>In fact, if the yacht isn&#8217;t sold soon, it could end up on the scrapheap, just to pay off the carrying costs.</p>

<p>The massive ship has room for 14 guests and 22 crew members, who are needed to maintain every aspect of the yacht.</p>



<p>It has four 1,730 hp diesel engines and can reach speeds of 22 knots.</p>



<p>Currently the 189th-longest yacht in the world, Tango also features a private owner&#8217;s deck, a contra-flow swimming pool, an outdoor cinema and a massage parlour.</p>



<p>It is far from the largest or most extravagant superyacht seized by international authorities since the start of sanctions against Russian citizens.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Everton-linked oligarch <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18269284/alisher-usmanovs-superyacht-seized-germany/">Alisher Usmanov&#8217;s £455m yacht was seized</a>, containing a £30m gold staircase.</p>



<p>However, even a comparatively modest yacht like Tango will still cost a fortune to run, roughly £7m a year.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the maintenance and storage become prohibitively expensive, the government can go to the court and say, &#8216;we want to sell this and reduce it to cash,'&#8221; Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor and money-laundering expert told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/seized-russian-yachts-may-soon-be-on-the-auction-block?ref=scroll">The Daily Beast</a>.</p>



<p>He added that the government would look to sell it &#8220;at auction for a fair market value and turning it into a liquid asset&#8221;.</p>



<p>Tango was the first yacht seized under the new task force, but, as experts on asset forfeiture warned, keeping hold of a luxury yacht is far harder.</p>



<p>&#8220;A Bugatti can be kept under a tarp in a garage until a case is concluded,&#8221; one federal law enforcement official told The Daily Beast. </p>



<p>&#8220;The same can&#8217;t be said of a yacht that&#8217;s the length of a football field.&#8221;</p>



<p>Megayachts can fall prey to salt damage, bacterial growth in the engine caused by seawater entering the fuel tanks, barnacles, sun exposure, and even seagull poo.</p>



<p>Each of these seemingly minor issues can slowly destroy a ship and could make the Tango worthless by the time it is sold.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/18215808/yacht-stewardess-russian-oligarchs-24k-month-ridiculous-requests/">yacht stewardess who worked for Russian oligarchs</a> opened up on life on board the floating palaces.</p>



<p>The unnamed stewardess revealed she earns an astonishing £24k a month but receives ridiculous requests.</p>



<p>She told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1589317/Luxury-yacht-stewardess-secrets-Russian-American-french-millionaires-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Express</a>&nbsp;how the majority of her guests were Russian millionaires and billionaires.</p>



<p>&#8220;The big yachts, the private ones, the majority are from Russian oligarchs&#8230;. very rich Russian people that rent the yacht for a few days,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>And with no request off-limits, there can be some bizarre demands.</p>



<p>She says: &#8220;Once I got asked if I could make the dolphins jump during sunset. I said I was sorry but they were already booked.</p>



<p>&#8220;They ask for crazy stuff. One time they asked me if I could go to France to pick up a bottle of champagne they loved and we were in Italy!&#8221;</p>



<p>The crew member has a basic salary of £2,500 a month but can earn as much as £24,000 in the same period thanks to tips &#8211; which are £2,500-a-week at a &#8220;minimum&#8221;.</p>

<p>The footage of a zoo in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/nigeria/">Nigeria</a> was taken by international NGO Wild at Life after a concerned visitor called them about two lions. </p>



<p>The group work to reduce and halt the illegal trade of wild animals and rescue <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/animal-abuse/">mistreated animals</a> from zoos. </p>



<p>A spokesman described the lions as looking like “walking skeletons” due to their diminished appearance.</p>



<p>They also called the establishment keeping them a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6006446/thailand-zoo-animal-cruelty-cages/">“horror zoo”</a>.</p>

<p>After already rescuing abused lions in Burkina Faso and Nigeria, Wild at Life deployed a team – led by Chief Conservation Officer (CCO) Aslihan Gedik – to rescue the animals, and have since given them emergency food and medical care.</p>



<p>Pictures show one of the skinny lions at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11405059/zoo-forces-chimpanzee-bike-spraying-coronavirus-disinfectant/">horrific zoo</a> eating what appears to be raw meat after being rescued.</p>



<p>In a clip filmed last year, two lions can be seen lying down in their enclosure and appear to be incredibly thin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, as they walk around their bones are completely on show.</p>

<p>Pictures taken at the same time are equally upsetting, showing the lions&#8217; apparently malnourished state.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wildatlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild at Life</a> CCO Aslihan Gedik said: “Wild at Life has a very strong track record and know-how on rescuing lions from various places and conducting a successful campaign against canned hunting as well.</p>



<p>“Our main goal is to close all the lion breeding farms once and for all. We need to keep wildlife, wild.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier this month we revealed a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18199905/inside-worlds-saddest-zoo/">blind bear had been locked in a cage for 30 years</a> while miserable monkeys were kept in darkness at the world&#8217;s saddest zoo.</p>



<p>Dozens of other animals, including a lioness and monkeys are held in the dark in a dilapidated barn, were discovered when officials visited the zoo in Armenia.</p>

<p>Experts believe its body was preserved at the bottom of an ancient ocean before ice and snow melted to push fossils 9,000ft up in the newly formed Alps. </p>



<p>Dr Heinz Furrer, at the University of Zurich, said: “This was a massive predator, one of the biggest that has ever lived. </p>



<p>&#8220;It would have used its huge teeth to catch fish, squid and even big alligators or crocodiles.</p>



<p>“It may also have eaten smaller ichthyosaurs.”</p>

<p>Remains have been found before in Canada, but they were toothless. The ones in Europe had rows of gnashers good for skewering big prey and could move at 22mph.</p>



<p>They fed on about a ton of meat a day.</p>



<p>Researcher Dr Martin Sandler, of the University of Bonn, said: “They would have been very scary and put Jaws to shame!”</p>



<p>“Bigger is always better. There are distinct selective advantages to large body size. </p>



<p>&#8220;Life will go there if it can. Unfortunately, hunting large prey is very difficult and exhausting, which was probably their downfall.</p>

<p>“RUSSIAN drone! Run!” barked Misha, a hardened Ukrainian soldier, sending us fleeing for cover amid fears missiles could be heading our way in moments.</p>



<p>We scrambled for shelter after being buzzed by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> unmanned aerial vehicle ahead of a massive rocket and artillery bombardment that killed at least three.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18395364" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/PJN_Frontline_Kharkiv0026JPG-JS728834556.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18395364" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">We were present for a massive rocket and artillery bombardment that killed at least three.

<p>Frontline troops are already well familiar with the engine’s whine from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18309956/russia-troops-cameras-game-pads-sat-navs-ukraine/">spy drones</a>, which scour the ruins of high-rise flats in bomb-blitzed northern Kharkiv seeking possible targets.</p>



<p>This time the nerve-shredding sound broke the spooky calm in the devastated Saltivka district, forewarning <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18335072/brit-soldiers-training-ukrainian-troops-uk-bases/">the soldiers</a> of a looming attack.</p>



<p>Most homes here are abandoned, only a few desperate residents now living amid the ruins less than two miles from Russian lines.</p>



<p>Moments before the drone swoop, we saw an old man cooking on an open stove in a courtyard because his flat had no gas or power.</p>

<p>Seconds later, as Misha yelled “Run”, we started our dash through a maze of apartment blocks — retracing our steps towards our car.</p>



<p>Troops glanced at the sky in vain to try to spot the Russian aircraft.</p>



<p>A second soldier told us: “Sometimes you only have two or three minutes from when the drone goes up to when the shelling starts.”</p>



<p>Most of the homes we passed had been reduced to hollow shells and rubble by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18285374/russia-bombards-ukrainian-cities-kharkiv/">near ceaseless Russian bombardment</a>.</p>

<p>One block had totally collapsed from a suspected missile strike.</p>



<p>In another, the relentless rocket attacks had punched gaping holes through concrete walls.</p>



<p>Misha told us that in the worst bombardment he counted 80 blasts in one go — two full loads from a Grad multiple rocket launcher.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine’s</a> second city has also been hit by Kalibr cruise missiles, Iskander rockets and tank and artillery shells.</p>



<p>Vlad, a member of the city’s Territorial Defence Unit, told us when we had reached relative safety that “we were lucky” to have got out.</p>



<p>He said: “Half an hour after we left there was a massive bombardment where we’d been.</p>



<p>“There were tanks, artillery and Grad rockets, everything, and it lasted 90 minutes. It was big.”</p>



<p>Both sides jam each other’s drones so they are not always able to send a live video feed.</p>



<p>Vlad said it was possible the Russians had to land their drone before they could see its surveillance feed, which may have given us precious extra minutes to get away.</p>



<p>He said: “Maybe that’s why it took some time.”</p>



<p>No troops from the city’s defence force were killed in the bombardment because the early warning of the drone gave them time to retreat to underground bunkers.</p>



<p>They have dug a network to defend themselves, and the north-eastern city, from a dreaded ground attack.</p>

<p>However, Kharkiv’s governor said three civilians died and eight were injured in a nearby part of the city during Tuesday’s blitz.</p>



<p>More than 230 civilians have so far been killed in Kharkiv since the start of the war in February and 1,600 homes have been destroyed.</p>



<p>Yesterday Russian troops continued their attacks across eastern Ukraine as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">ruthless tyrant Vladimir Putin</a> vowed his war aims would be “unconditionally accomplished”.</p>



<p>At least one woman died in a hospital hit by shells in Severodonetsk, the regional governor said.</p>



<p>In the frontline town of Avdiivka, in Donetsk, officials accused Russian forces of unleashing horrific white phosphorous weapons.</p>



<p>The incendiary bombs burn through flesh at 2,700C.</p>



<p>Officials said they hit a coke plant and the town ­centre.</p>



<p>Local defence chief Pavlo Kyrylenko said: “As a result of the two rounds of shelling, several fires broke out in the city.”</p>



<p>It came as Ukraine’s human rights chief said 400 people had reported rapes by Russian forces in the first two weeks of April.</p>



<p>Liudmyla Denisova said she had appealed to UN aid agencies to send them trauma counsellors to stop staff burning out.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s armed forces said Russian troops continued to gain some ground in Donbas, which <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18311365/battle-for-donbas-ukraine-russia-war/">President Putin wants to conquer</a> by Russia’s annual Victory Day on May 9.</p>



<p>But Ukraine’s defenders repelled a number of incursions.</p>



<p>Troops were also fighting street to street in the ruins of Popasna.</p>



<p>Mykola Khanatov, head of the city’s military administration, summed up the situation there as “horror, sorrow, pain”.</p>

<p>Mr Khanatov said: “We are trying to organise the evacuation every day, but unfortunately we only control half of the city, the other half is occupied.”</p>

<p>MICHAEL Jackson &#8220;thrived&#8221; on watching his unruly chimps attack kids and staff and even &#8220;got his kicks&#8221; from training the primates to molest women at his Neverland ranch, his former maid has claimed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-jackson/">King of Pop</a> also allowed his child pals to hurl huge rocks at his terrified lion Kimber, let his elephants be chained by their legs in tiny enclosures &#8211; and even encouraged visitors to pet his giraffes even though the animals had previously attacked an adult and a youngster, she said.</p>

<p>Tonight, an ITV documentary with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ross-kemp/">Ross Kemp</a> will seek to find out what happened to Jackson&#8217;s menagerie of animals 13 years after the singer&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>The TV show, Searching For Michael Jackson&#8217;s Zoo, which airs tonight, reveals how many of the singer&#8217;s big pets died prematurely &#8211; with two giraffes dying in a fire and another from a broken neck.</p>



<p>Speaking for the first time about the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/animal-abuse/">animal abuse</a>, cruelty, torture, frequent attacks and sickening actions of workers at the star&#8217;s California ranch, MJ&#8217;s personal maid Adrian McManus said it still breaks her heart to think about what went on. </p>



<p>McManus worked as Jackson&#8217;s personal&nbsp;maid&nbsp;from 1990 to 1994.</p>

<p>Jackson insisted that she was one of just a few close staff who had access to his private quarters in Neverland.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/exclusives/">exclusive</a> interview, McManus told The Sun how she was attacked by MJ&#8217;s two orangutans Patrick and Brandy who grabbed her hair and wouldn&#8217;t let it go &#8211; and was also bitten by Max, Jackson&#8217;s untrained chimp, who was given the run of the house.</p>



<p>But rather than blame the animals, she points the finger firmly at crazed Jackson for thinking he was a &#8220;real-life Doctor Doolittle&#8221;.</p>



<p>McManus, 60, from Nipomo, California said: &#8220;Michael said he was an animal&nbsp;lover, but many animals were poorly&nbsp;treated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The&nbsp;zoo should not have been there because&nbsp;no one ever really properly&nbsp;looked after the animals&nbsp;and all of the staff were in danger. I am shocked no one got seriously injured or attacked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael should never have been allowed to have kept those animals. It breaks my heart to think about all the cruelty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Animals died and disappeared all the time at Neverland, but unusually it was considered normal.&nbsp;No one seemed to investigate or ask questions.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="animal-attacks-treated-as-joke">ANIMAL ATTACKS &#8216;TREATED AS JOKE&#8217;</h2>



<p>Now The Sun can reveal how uncaring Jackson &#8220;thrived&#8221; on the chaos his animals created &#8211; and frequent bites and attacks by them were treated &#8220;as a joke&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Thriller singer had an obsession with monkeys and after getting rid of Bubbles, he bought two chimps Max and Alex, a deformed baby monkey called Ariel and a little green monkey.</p>



<p>All of them were left to run riot, looked after by terrified staff with no training.</p>



<p>Most shockingly, McManus recalls walking in on one of the star&#8217;s child friends sat in shock with blood dripping down his face after one vicious attack by Max.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day a security team sped across the property to pick me up from cleaning the movie theatre in a small white pickup truck,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me I had to get to Michael&#8217;s room immediately as he was asking for me, but they didn&#8217;t know for what reason.&#8221;</p>



<p>She went on: &#8220;They raced back to the house, I ran into his private chambers and saw Michael sat on the right-hand side of his bed, looking furious.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of his child friends was sat there next to him, looking scared and nervous with blood trickling down his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael sternly said: &#8216;We couldn&#8217;t find you&#8230; I need you to go find some antiseptic and a band-aid as one of the chimps has bitten him.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;The boy, his eyes watering, said nothing, but his face was swelling up. He looked in utter shock and trauma.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael turned to him and raged: &#8216;I told you not to tease the chimp.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I ran to a walk-in pantry for medical supplies and handed him what creams we had, bandages and Michael cleaned him up on his own. It was not spoken about ever again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Soon after that experience, all the staff were sent to a doctor&#8217;s office in Solvang to get tetanus shots. We were told it was for our safety with the animals.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="get-his-kicks">GET HIS KICKS</h2>



<p>Chillingly, McManus, believes the chimps may have been trained to unknowingly sexually harass and molest women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;On another occasion, I was out by the merry go round ride at the back of the main house,” she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Me and another maid. on a break, went over to see them with their trainer. Max ran up to me, knelt down a little and stuck his head under my skirt.</p>



<p>&#8220;I panicked and asked &#8216;Who taught him that?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;It felt like he had been trained to do that move, but the handler just laughed at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then Max ran off and played on the merry-go-round.&#8221;</p>

<p>It claimed that Jacko, who died in 2009, used alarms, bells and one-way glass to alert him to anyone approaching the alleged rape chambers.</p>
<p>He famously turned the sprawling estate he bought in 1988 into a kid&#8217;s play park with a ferris wheel, zoo, pirate ship, bumper cars, a rollercoaster and amusement arcades.</p>
<p>Now as more bombshell claims emerge about Netherland, we look back at its sordid world.</p>

<h2>Creepy hideouts</h2>
<p>In  Leaving Neverland, James Safechuck claimed bells lined a series of doors that led to Jackson’s master bedroom, which would alert the entertainer to anyone approaching the suite.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We would get a blanket and we would lie it on the floor in the closet, so we could close the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there were bells and you could have a moment of hearing them trip so at least you knew if people were coming for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the alleged sex acts were not only confined to Jackson’s closet, Safechuck claims.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;He also had an Indian fort with like teepees so we would lay down sleeping and have snacks and have sexual relations there.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was also a game room and then upstairs in the arcade there was a bed and we would go up there and have sex there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Safechuck also said Jacko would carry out abuse in a creepy third floor attic and in another building on the ranch which was “far away from the main house” where Jackson housed some of his own memorabilia.</p>
<p>Then there was the cinema &#8211; with two private rooms fitted with one-way glass &#8211; where Jackson was almost caught out by the then schoolboy’s mother Stephanie.</p>
<p>Safechuck said: &#8220;The movie theatre had these two private rooms and you could see into the theatre… and we would have sex in those rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a bit dangerous. There was a bit of excitement there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outdoor pool and hot tub were further sites of child sex abuse, claimed Safechuck and alleged Jackson said he had purchased the remote home just for him.</p>

<p>In an exclusive piece for The Sun, Ross Kemp gave a tease of what could be expected in his new documentary about Jacko&#8217;s zoo.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Everyone remembers Bubbles the chimpanzee who was brought to Press conferences and featured in the Thriller star’s music videos.</p>

<p>The pair noticed something suspicious lurking in the water nearby when suddenly a crocodile lunged out of the water and onto their boat.</p>



<p>Kathryn said: &#8220;The whole time we were out there, we would go, &#8216;Is that a croc or is that a stick?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, the stick turned around.&#8221;</p>



<p>The couple filmed the moment the crocodile was drawn to their boat by the fishing line.</p>



<p>The dangerous beast is seen swimming quickly up to the vessel before snapping its jaws at the fishing line.</p>



<p>The crocodile&#8217;s attention is then caught by the mobile phone filming over the side of the boat.</p>

<p>The animal launches itself out of the water and butts its head against the phone.</p>



<p>For a moment it manages to hold onto the edge of the vessel with its two forefeet before it sinks back into the water.</p>



<p>The boat then jets away leaving behind the crocodile.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was an absolute shock, it only lasted about two seconds, but it felt like time stood still,&#8221; Kathryn said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She added the near death experience would make her think twice about being complacent in rivers in the Northern Territory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;They should be respected&#8230; we won&#8217;t be making that mistake again,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The video has since been shared on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a> and has racked in nearly 204k views, and over 8.3k likes.</p>



<p>The adventure seekers archive their travels around the country to social media and their YouTube channel: TIDES &#8211; Kat and Cam&#8217;s Kimberley Adventures.</p>



<p>Kathryn and Cameron aren&#8217;t the only ones to have had near-death experiences with crocs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia&#8217;s</a> Northern Territory is known for its deadly creatures &#8211; including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16494633/biggest-crocodiles-aussie-river-darwin/">crocodiles up to 20ft-long</a>.</p>



<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5097219/crocodile-jumps-out-river-terrified-tourists-australia/">terrified tourists were left stunned</a> when a saltwater crocodile leapt straight out of the Australian river just inches from a boat.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/zambia/">Zambia</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16912055/brit-backpacker-attacked-crocodile-africa-pal-punched-death-roll/">young British woman</a> was savaged by a crocodile before a brave pal saved her life by &#8220;furiously&#8221; punching the beast.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin has warned he will use nuclear weapons against the West if anyone interferes in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The threat comes as the Russian leader said the response  to counterstrikes will be &#8220;lightning fast.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18392326" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 917px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-22-3.png?strip=all&amp;w=907" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18392326" width="907" height="650" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin threatened he will use nuclear weapons</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Speaking to lawmakers he said: &#8220;If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia. </p>



<p>&#8220;They must know that our response to counterstrikes will be lightning fast. Fast.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won’t brag about them.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we will use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mad Vlad appears to be referring to his<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18326876/putins-arsenal-superweapons-laser-canon-poseidon/"> six superweapons</a> including Russia&#8217;s deadly Sarmat missile,  dubbed &#8220;Satan 2&#8221;  that was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">launched</a> last week.</p>



<p>The missile can fly 11,000 miles, carry 15 warheads and has the potential to destroy an area the size of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/">France</a>.</p>



<p>The tyrant continued by saying Kremlin &#8220;can&#8217;t allow an anti-Russia to be created on Russia&#8217;s historical territory&#8221; and added that Ukraine was &#8220;pushed&#8221; to attack Crimea and Donbas.</p>



<p>Accusing the West of using Ukrainians as &#8220;expendable materials,&#8221; he added that they &#8220;prepared en masse an economic war against Russia, step by step, using all kinds of pretexts and sometimes none at all to pass sanctions.&#8221;</p>

<p>It comes after Russia threatened to strike military targets in the UK after Britain supplied weapons to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the hits could be authorised against<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/"> Nato</a> member states.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;Do we understand correctly that for the sake of disrupting the logistics of military supplies, Russia can strike military targets on the territory of those Nato countries that supply arms to the Kyiv regime?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, this directly leads to deaths and bloodshed on Ukrainian territory. As far as I understand, Britain is one of those countries.”</p>



<p>It comes as pro-<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a>&nbsp;TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/?rec_article=true">threatened to blow &#8220;boorish Britain&#8221;</a> using the deadly 16,000mph Satan 2 nuke, over the UK&#8217;s support for Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,&#8221; he said on the Kremlin-controlled state TV channel.</p>



<p>Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">successfully launched the missile </a>earlier this month with Putin warning the test was &#8220;food for thought for those who try to threaten&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>,&#8221;</p>



<p>A video showed the killer missile being launched from an underground silo, triggering an enormous fireball.</p>



<p>It travelled almost the entire length of Russia &#8211; almost 3,600 miles &#8211; in around 15 minutes and landed at Kura Missile Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister warned a nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger as British and Nato weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>In a chilling message, Sergei Lavrov said the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221;  &#8211; saying the West is essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv. </p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything. </p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the war hawk said weapons shipments from Britain and other Nato countries &#8220;would be a legitimate target&#8221;  &#8211; reiterating what <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18144176/russia-target-british-weapons-accuses-escalating-war-ukraine/">Russian commanders have said previously</a> since the invasion at the end of February. </p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;. </p>



<p>But he claimed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> wanted to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a> at all costs. </p>



<p>Western countries have been supplying aid, weapons and equipment to Ukraine &#8211; stopping short of sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone.</p>



<p>Britain has been supplying anti-tank weapons, anti-air missiles and plans to send <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a> to help them fight against Russia.</p>



<p>And Lavrov stoked the fires once again as he outright accused the West of waging a hidden conflict against Russia. </p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.&#8221;</p>



<p>The foreign minister also criticised Kyiv&#8217;s approach to peace talks with Moscow.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Goodwill has its limits. But if it isn&#8217;t reciprocal, that doesn&#8217;t help the negotiation process.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described Lavrov&#8217;s comments as a sign of Russia&#8217;s weakness.</p>



<p>In a statement on Twitter, Kuleba said Russia had lost its &#8220;last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;This only means Moscow senses defeat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Britain also downplayed the Russian warnings.</p>



<p>Armed Services Minister James Heappey told the BBC: &#8220;Lavrov&#8217;s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heappey also said it was &#8220;completely legitimate&#8221; for Ukraine to use British weapons in attacks on Russian infrastructure.</p>



<h3 id="russian-threat">RUSSIAN THREAT</h3>



<p>He added that the UK would restart training inside Ukraine if the conflict became &#8220;frozen&#8221; in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>



<p>In response, Russia&#8217;s defence ministry said: &#8220;We would like to underline that London&#8217;s direct provocation of the Kyiv regime into such actions if such actions are carried out, will immediately lead to our proportional response.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we have warned, the Russian Armed Forces are in round-the-clock readiness to launch retaliatory strikes with high-precision long-range weapons at decision-making centers in Kyiv.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/invasion-has-cost-russia-an-estimated-15-000-lives-f52s2qgk7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Times</a>&nbsp;that Heappey’s remarks had the &#8220;potential to invite retaliatory attacks into Poland&#8221; adding that the West was becoming &#8220;increasingly involved in a proxy war.&#8221; </p>



<p>Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has warned that Russia&#8217;s threat of a &#8220;proportional response&#8221; against Britain for backing Ukrainian strikes behind Russian lines is &#8220;unlawful.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said Vladimir Putin&#8217;s regime is only adding to its &#8220;pariah status&#8221; by threatening other countries, including by shutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</p>



<p>Mr Raab, who is also Justice Secretary, told Sky News: &#8220;The Russian statement is unlawful and what we&#8217;re doing is lawful, we&#8217;re entitled, all states are entitled to provide military support to any state exercising the right of lawful defence against an aggressive invasion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Frankly if Russia starts threatening other countries it only adds further to their pariah status and will only further the solidarity and consensus in the international community that they must be stopped.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as earlier today a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386496/russian-ammunition-depot-ukraine-strike/"> Russian ammunition depot </a>in the Belgorod region exploded in a suspected strike by Ukraine.  </p>



<p>Two more attacks were also suspected with reports of explosions in the regions of the Voronezh and Kursk.</p>



<p>Ukraine has not confirmed the strikes &#8211; but video appears to show anti-air missile being fired in the area.</p>



<p>On Monday the US approved the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.</p>



<p>The Pentagon said the package could include ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.</p>



<p>Moscow&#8217;s ambassador to Washington told the US to halt shipments &#8211; warning that Western weapons were fuelling the conflict.</p>



<p>Moscow has stepped up its blame on the UK, claiming a secret “Psyops&#8221; unit operating in Ukraine has carried out war atrocities such as raping women and bombing children.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than five million people to flee.</p>



<p>Russia has yet to capture any of Ukraine&#8217;s biggest cities after its forces pulled back from the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv in the face of resistance last month. </p>

<p>Putin&#8217;s new war aims to focus mainly on the east &#8211; and more troops have been sent there for an assault on two provinces.</p>



<p>While focusing on the east and south, Russia has also been targeting other parts of Ukraine with missiles and airstrikes. </p>

<p>A TERRIFIED woman has shared the moment she feared for her life, when she discovered a chilling note from her abusive former partner.</p>



<p>The post shared on the social blogging forum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/reddit/">Reddit</a> shows a picture of a yellow post-it note labelled &#8220;vacation plans&#8221; with a sketch of a coffin matched with the woman&#8217;s measurements.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18391602" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 472px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/90dfa450-3c25-47ff-8e4e-8f2d2d6d10e3.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=462" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18391602" width="462" height="593" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A woman found a chilling post-it note from her ex-partner with a coffin drawn on to match her dimensions</figcaption><figcredit>Reddit</figcredit></figure>



<p>The caption reads: &#8220;I left my abusive partner and found this post-it note in his tool box that details his plans for a coffin that he labels “vacation plans :)”. </p>



<p>&#8220;It matches my measurements.&#8221;</p>



<p>The user explained she found the note after her partner moved out as he left his toolbox behind.</p>



<p>After he never collected it, she gave the tools to a friend &#8211; and then discovered the note.</p>



<p>The post has received over 2.2k upvotes with many users jumping to the comments to share their thoughts.</p>



<p>One user said: &#8220;Not sure what makes this &#8216;oddly terrifying&#8217; it’s literally just terrifying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another said: &#8220;Dodged a bullet. Or in this case a nail in the coffin&#8221;.</p>



<p>While a third said: &#8220;Am I about to be witness to a murder?&#8221;</p>



<p>Other users gave thorough responses to the post, drawing similarities to their own experiences and sharing advice.</p>



<p>One user said: &#8220;I sincerely hope you’ve taken all precautions to ensure he doesn’t find you,&#8221; before going on to share their own chilling experiences.</p>

<p>And now US officials have told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-down-russian-plane-carrying-hundreds-of-troops.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a> that one of the reasons Ukraine was able to target Putin&#8217;s forces was US intelligence.</p>



<p>The officials said the US informed Ukraine of the time and location Russia intended to strike.</p>



<p>A US official said: &#8220;From the get-go, we leaned pretty heavily forward in sharing both strategic and actionable intelligence with Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been impactful both at a tactical and strategic level. There are examples where you could tell a pretty clear story that this made a major difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>A former senior intelligence official told NBC: &#8220;There has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces.</p>



<p>He added that the information could be commercial satellite images &#8220;but also a lot of other intelligence about, for example, where certain types of Russian units are active.&#8221;</p>



<p>And Ukraine has been able to move air defences and aircraft, in some cases just in time, another US official said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Russian military has literally been cratering empty fields where air defenses were once set up.</p>



<p>&#8220;It has had an enormous impact on the Russian military’s ability on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ukrainian fighters were able <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18361839/vladimir-putin-troops-reveal-mission/">to attack a Russian transport plane </a>heading to Hostomel airport, 30 miles outside Kyiv, by using coordinates shared by the US, officials added.</p>



<p>The hit was crucial in the battle to save Kyiv as it weakened Putin&#8217;s troops&nbsp;who failed to secure the airfield, forcing them to use the road instead.</p>



<p>Top Russian general Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17837254/russian-general-dead-ukraine-sniper/"> was shot dead</a> by a sniper in the battle.</p>



<p>Another official added that the CIA is gathering intelligence in a bid to protect the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and is consulting with Ukraine on &#8220;how best to move him around,&nbsp;making sure that he’s not co-located with his entire chain of command, things like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Last month Putin lost another general, Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18000210/putin-loses-fifth-general-blow-invasion-ukraine/">was killed in battle</a>&nbsp;at Chornobaivka, near the southern city of Kherson.</p>



<p>It followed the death of Major General Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th Combined Arms Army and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17877568/russian-general-killed-ukraine-vladimir-putin/">Vitaly Gerasimov</a>, who was killed in fighting outside Kharkiv.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17781459/missile-strikes-third-night-fighting-2/">General Magomed Tushaev&nbsp;</a>died when his Chechen special forces column, including 56 tanks, was obliterated near Hostomel, north-east of the city.</p>



<p>Major-General Oleg Mityaev, 47, died in Mariupol as well as Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev who also died in the fighting.</p>



<p>Earlier today a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386496/russian-ammunition-depot-ukraine-strike/">Russian ammunition depot</a> in the Belgorod region was reportedly hit by Ukraine with pictures showing fire and smoke coming from the site.</p>



<p>Two more attacks were also suspected with reports of explosions in the regions of the Voronezh and Kursk.</p>

<p> A DIY fan thought he hit the jackpot when he discovered nearly £130,000 in cash in a set of kitchen cabinets he bought from eBay.</p>



<p>But much to his disappointment, Thomas Heller soon realised he couldn&#8217;t keep the winning stash.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18388505" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728986114.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18388505" width="960" height="538" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Thomas Heller discovered nearly £130k in cash in a cabinet set he bought from eBay[/caption]

<figure id="attachment_18388513" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728986146.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18388513" width="960" height="538" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>The social housing manager director took the envelopes to the police where they discovered even more cash[/caption]



<p>The 50-year-old social housing managing director from Bitterfeld, Germany had bought the oak veneer cabinets from an elderly couple&#8217;s estate sale in Halle on eBay earlier this month.</p>



<p>After some negotiating, Thomas managed to snap them up for a bargain price.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;The piece was supposed to cost €300 (£253). But we were able to negotiate the price down €240 (£203).&#8221;</p>



<p>But Thomas soon discovered the cabinets were worth a little more than the asking price, when he found a forgotten secret cash stash worth €150,000 (£126,166).</p>



<p>Thomas said: &#8220;One [envelope] was open and a lot of €100 bills were looking at me.&#8221;</p>



<p>After discovering cash in the first envelope, Thomas took both findings to the local police station where they discovered the second envelope had even more winnings.</p>

<p>He added: &#8220;They opened the second, locked cupboard in front of my eyes. There were larger bills in the envelopes. Two hundred, five hundred.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amazed by the amount of money and the man&#8217;s honesty, police took the case to the district court and began an investigation to find the kitchen&#8217;s original owner.</p>



<p>Investigators soon discovered that the money belonged to a 91-year-old woman from Halle, who was nursed in a retirement home after her husband passed away.</p>



<p>Police spokesperson Astrid Kuchta said: &#8220;The kitchen came from a household liquidation by an elderly couple from Halle.</p>



<p>&#8220;The two cash boxes were well hidden in areas of the furniture that were difficult to see.&#8221;</p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=15676&#038;game=polling"></script>



<p>Kuchta revealed that the buyer had bought the kitchen from a service provider who sold it on behalf of the previous owner.</p>



<p>The seller, who was in fact the elderly couple&#8217;s grandson, told the newspaper MDR he had no idea about the money.</p>



<p>Under German law, keeping found cash worth €10 (£8.41) or more is a criminal offence and is classified as embezzlement &#8211; with offenders possibly facing up to three years in prison.</p>

<p>RUSSIAN state TV has threatened to wipe &#8220;boorish Britain&#8221; off the map with Vladimir Putin&#8217;s 16,000mph &#8220;Satan 2&#8221; nuke for supporting Ukraine.</p>

<p>And in a chilling warning, pro-<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov threatened to blow Britain to smithereens using the terrifying projectile.</p>



<p>&#8220;As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The brazen host, acting at Putin&#8217;s mouthpiece on the Kremlin-controlled state TV channel, said Britain had got &#8220;totally boorish&#8221;, referring to the UK&#8217;s continued support for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> has already <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386648/russia-threatens-strike-targets-britain/">threatened to strike military targets in the UK</a> over its supply of weapons to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Western countries have been giving aid, weapons and equipment to the country &#8211; stopping short of sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone.</p>



<p>Britain has been supplying anti-tank weapons, anti-air missiles and plans to send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a>&nbsp;to help them fight against Russia.</p>



<p>Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said strikes could be authorised against Nato member states after Moscow accused forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons&#8221; into the country.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386648/russia-threatens-strike-targets-britain/#"></a></p>



<p>Head of the Russian space agency Dmitry Rogozin, a close Putin ally, told state TV anchor Solovyov that Russia &#8220;will have 46 combat complexes of strategic weapon Sarmat&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is according to plan with us,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Tyrant Putin hailed the development of the new missile &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">successfully test-fired earlier this month</a>&nbsp;&#8211; as &#8220;a big, significant event&#8221; for Russia&#8217;s defence industry.</p>



<p>He boasted that the projectile will &#8220;force those who try to threaten Russia to think twice&#8221;.</p>



<p>The dictator said: &#8220;The missile can break through all modern anti-missile defences.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is nothing like this anywhere in the world, and won&#8217;t be for a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>The missile is said to be the world&#8217;s longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>



<p>Russia successfully test-launched the missile last week with video showing the enormous 115-foot rocket being launched from an underground silo, triggering a huge fireball.</p>



<p>It travelled almost the entire length of Russia &#8211; almost 3,600 miles &#8211; in around 15 minutes as a watching Putin grinned with glee.</p>



<p>The missile then landed at Kura Missile Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the far east of the country, according to Russian defence sources.</p>



<p>The separate warheads in the Satan 2 missile are capable of detaching from the main 100-tonne missile before travelling towards their target at hypersonic speeds.</p>

<figure id="attachment_18388407" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727622928-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18388407" width="960" height="592" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Vladimir Putin meeting his defence minister Sergei Shoigu[/caption]



<p>The bombs are 1,000 times more powerful than those dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War Two.</p>



<p>It comes as Russia&#8217;s foreign minister warned a nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger as British and Nato weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Sergei Lavrov said the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221; &#8211; saying the West is essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into&nbsp;Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he claimed&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a>&nbsp;at all costs.</p>



<p>It comes as earlier today a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386496/russian-ammunition-depot-ukraine-strike/">&nbsp;Russian ammunition depot&nbsp;</a>in the Belgorod region exploded in a suspected strike by Ukraine.</p>

<p>He later told local media that when he removed his blindfold Pushpa told him she doesn’t want to get married.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunil Kumar, the deputy superintendent of police in Andhra Pradesh, told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmzpg/crime-india-slit-throat-arranged-marriage-attempted-murder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice World News</a>: &#8220;According to her statement, she just didn’t want to get married to this guy or anyone else.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added that while Pushpa was not pressured into marrying Naidu she did not share her doubts with her family and did not think about the consequences of her &#8220;immature&#8221; actions. </p>



<p>In an&nbsp;interview&nbsp;with a local TV channel Naidu, speaking from his hospital bed, said his parents arranged the match last year. </p>



<p>Pushpa has been charged with attempted murder and is now in custody.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If convicted, she could be jailed for ten years.</p>



<p>Now the couple&#8217;s parents blame each other for the incident.</p>

<p>RUSSIA has threatened to strike military targets in the UK after Britain supplied weapons to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">successfully launched the missile </a>earlier this month with Putin warning the test was &#8220;food for thought for those who try to threaten <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>,&#8221;</p>



<p>A video showed the killer missile being launched from an underground silo, triggering an enormous fireball.</p>



<p>It travelled almost the entire length of Russia &#8211; almost 3,600 miles &#8211; in around 15 minutes and landed at Kura Missile Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister warned a nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger as British and Nato weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>In a chilling message, Sergei Lavrov said the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221;  &#8211; saying the West is essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv. </p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything. </p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the war hawk said weapons shipments from Britain and other Nato countries &#8220;would be a legitimate target&#8221;  &#8211; reiterating what <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18144176/russia-target-british-weapons-accuses-escalating-war-ukraine/">Russian commanders have said previously</a> since the invasion at the end of February. </p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;. </p>



<p>But he claimed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> wanted to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a> at all costs. </p>



<p>Western countries have been supplying aid, weapons and equipment to Ukraine &#8211; stopping short of sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone.</p>



<p>Britain has been supplying anti-tank weapons, anti-air missiles and plans to send <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a> to help them fight against Russia.</p>



<p>And Lavrov stoked the fires once again as he outright accused the West of waging a hidden conflict against Russia. </p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.&#8221;</p>



<p>The foreign minister also criticised Kyiv&#8217;s approach to peace talks with Moscow.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Goodwill has its limits. But if it isn&#8217;t reciprocal, that doesn&#8217;t help the negotiation process.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described Lavrov&#8217;s comments as a sign of Russia&#8217;s weakness.</p>



<p>In a statement on Twitter, Kuleba said Russia had lost its &#8220;last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;This only means Moscow senses defeat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Britain also downplayed the Russian warnings.</p>



<p>Armed Services Minister James Heappey told the BBC: &#8220;Lavrov&#8217;s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heappey also said it was &#8220;completely legitimate&#8221; for Ukraine to use British weapons in attacks on Russian infrastructure.</p>



<h3 id="russian-threat">RUSSIAN THREAT</h3>



<p>He added that the UK would restart training inside Ukraine if the conflict became &#8220;frozen&#8221; in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>



<p>In response, Russia&#8217;s defence ministry said: &#8220;We would like to underline that London&#8217;s direct provocation of the Kyiv regime into such actions if such actions are carried out, will immediately lead to our proportional response.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we have warned, the Russian Armed Forces are in round-the-clock readiness to launch retaliatory strikes with high-precision long-range weapons at decision-making centers in Kyiv.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/invasion-has-cost-russia-an-estimated-15-000-lives-f52s2qgk7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Times</a>&nbsp;that Heappey’s remarks had the &#8220;potential to invite retaliatory attacks into Poland&#8221; adding that the West was becoming &#8220;increasingly involved in a proxy war.&#8221; </p>



<p>Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has warned that Russia&#8217;s threat of a &#8220;proportional response&#8221; against Britain for backing Ukrainian strikes behind Russian lines is &#8220;unlawful.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said Vladimir Putin&#8217;s regime is only adding to its &#8220;pariah status&#8221; by threatening other countries, including by shutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</p>



<p>Mr Raab, who is also Justice Secretary, told Sky News: &#8220;The Russian statement is unlawful and what we&#8217;re doing is lawful, we&#8217;re entitled, all states are entitled to provide military support to any state exercising the right of lawful defence against an aggressive invasion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Frankly if Russia starts threatening other countries it only adds further to their pariah status and will only further the solidarity and consensus in the international community that they must be stopped.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as earlier today a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386496/russian-ammunition-depot-ukraine-strike/"> Russian ammunition depot </a>in the Belgorod region exploded in a suspected strike by Ukraine.  </p>



<p>Two more attacks were also suspected with reports of explosions in the regions of the Voronezh and Kursk.</p>



<p>Ukraine has not confirmed the strikes &#8211; but video appears to show anti-air missile being fired in the area.</p>



<p>On Monday the US approved the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine.</p>



<p>The Pentagon said the package could include ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.</p>



<p>Moscow&#8217;s ambassador to Washington told the US to halt shipments &#8211; warning that Western weapons were fuelling the conflict.</p>



<p>Moscow has stepped up its blame on the UK, claiming a secret “Psyops&#8221; unit operating in Ukraine has carried out war atrocities such as raping women and bombing children.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than five million people to flee.</p>



<p>Russia has yet to capture any of Ukraine&#8217;s biggest cities after its forces pulled back from the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv in the face of resistance last month. </p>

<p>A RUSSIAN ammunition depot has exploded in what is suspected to be another strike by Ukraine across the border as they push back against Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>The ammo dump in the Belgorod region was reportedly ablaze and pictures show a huge plume of fire and smoke billowing over the landscape.</p>

<p>The war has now been raging for nearly two months &#8211; and Putin&#8217;s army have found themselves being decimated with an estimated 22,000 dead soldiers.</p>



<p>Russia has been humiliated and questions are mounting over what is next of Putin after the disastrous war, especially with mounting <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383848/putin-limping-meeting-un-chief/">questions over his health</a>. </p>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s suspected military strikes on Russian soil have sparked a new phase of tension in the war &#8211; with Putin fuming over the idea of Western weapons potentially being used in the attacks.</p>



<p>And Kremlin officials have chillingly warned that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18386648/russia-threatens-strike-targets-britain/">Russia could attack military sites in Western nations</a> &#8211; including Britain &#8211; which are being used to supply weapons to Ukraine. </p>

<p>In Kursk there were unconfirmed reports that Russian air defences had downed Ukrainian military drones.</p>



<p>Explosions were heard in the cities off Kursk and Oboyan, while locals heard the military planes flying over Oboyan.</p>



<p>In Voronezh region, there were reports Russian air defences were active to fend off an attack on strategic Baltimore military air base.</p>



<p>Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said on Telegram: &#8220;At approximately 03.35am I woke up from a loud bang that sounded like a blast. </p>



<p>&#8220;As I was writing this post, three more blasts were heard.”</p>



<p>He added: According to preliminary information, an ammunition depot is on fire near the village of Staraya Nelidovka.”</p>



<p>No civilian casualties were reported.</p>



<p>A blaze at Staraya Nelidovka in Belgorod region was reportedly extinguished.</p>



<p>The blasts follow suspected Ukrainian attacks earlier this week on two <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18362953/russia-oil-depot-explosion-fire-ukraine/">major oil facilities in Bryansk</a>.</p>



<p>Ukraine has previously been accused of staging attacks on Russian soil to disrupt Putin&#8217;s campaign.</p>



<p>Kyiv has however denied carrying out strikes across the border.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s been warned Moscow may be attempting to use staged attacks on their soil as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17639741/false-flag-operation-meaning-explained/">false flags</a>&nbsp;to justify escalating the war in Ukraine.</p>

<figure id="attachment_18386548" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Belgorod-explosions-8-east2west-news.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18386548" width="960" height="525" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ukraine has been accused of using drones and helicopters to run sorties into Russia</figcaption><figcredit>EAST 2 WEST</figcredit></figure>



<p>It comes as Putin&#8217;s top diplomat Sergei Lavrov warned the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18375080/nuclear-world-war-real-danger-britain-nato-target/">risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221;</a>.</p>



<p>He accused the West of essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>&#8220;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the war hawk said weapons shipments from Britain and other Nato countries &#8220;would be a legitimate target&#8221;.</p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a>&nbsp;at all costs.</p>



<p>Western countries have been supplying aid, weapons and equipment to Ukraine &#8211; stopping short of sending troops or imposing a no fly zone.</p>



<p>Britain has been supply anti-tank weapons, anti-air missile and plans to send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a>&nbsp;to help them fight against Russia.</p>



<p>But it is feared doing anything more could spark open war with Moscow &#8211; something which could easily spiral into a nuclear exchange.</p>



<p>And with this danger hanging over the region, the world is sitting the edge &#8211; with international tensions at highest point since the Cold War.</p>



<p>And Lavrov stoked the fires once again as he outright accused the West of waging a hidden conflict against Russia.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.&#8221;</p>



<p>The foreign minister also criticised Kyiv&#8217;s approach to peace talks with Moscow.</p>

<p>Following a major search mission involving the US Navy, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1228845/flight-recorder-from-crashed-egyptair-flight-believed-to-have-been-found/">plane&#8217;s black box was found</a> in deep water close to Greece.</p>



<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6718944/egyptair-ms804-flight-cause-fire-bomb-terrorist/">Egyptian authorities claimed the plane was brought down in a terrorist attack</a>, despite no group claiming responsibility.</p>



<p>It was claimed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2407115/explosives-found-on-victims-of-egyptair-flight-that-crashed-into-mediterranean/">explosives were found on the bodies of plane crash victims</a>, although this was later discredited.</p>



<p>However, an official investigation has concluded that smoke from the pilot&#8217;s cigarette accidentally ignited oxygen leaking from an emergency mask.</p>

<p>Egyptian pilots would often smoke in the cockpit, and incredibly, the practice wasn&#8217;t banned at the time of the 2016 crash, according to a 134-page report produced by aviation experts.</p>



<p>The setting on the oxygen mask had been switched by a maintenance engineer from normal to emergency, the experts said, as reported by the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera.</p>



<p>This caused the mask to emit oxygen, creating a highly volatile situation.</p>



<p>A hissing sound made by escaping oxygen was identified by investigators at around 2.25am on the morning of May 19, just minutes before the passenger jet crashed into the sea.</p>



<p>It isn&#8217;t known why the maintenance engineer had put the face mask into the emergency setting.</p>



<p>The experts&#8217; report has been sent to the Court of Appeal in Paris.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->
	<blockquote class="article__quote">

<p>An experienced pilot said the plane&#8217;s captain Mohamed Said Ali Ali Shoukair should have detected the faulty mask ahead of takeoff.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we go into the cabin, among the various checks we make before taking off is to check the flow of oxygen in the masks,&#8221; Italian pilot Daniele Veronelli told Corriere Della Sera.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the switch is in the normal position, the flow of oxygen is on request. If it is on the emergency setting, it will release oxygen at a greater pressure to blow away the smoke that could be in the cabin if there’s a fire on board.&#8221;</p>



<p>The report is yet to be released publicly, according to the Italian newspaper.</p>

<p>Grieving relatives have spoken out in anger at the news.</p>



<p>Julie Heslouin, who lost her brother, 41, and 75-year-old father in the disaster said: &#8220;We have been waiting since 2016 to understand why we lost our loved ones and officially no one told us anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2018, France&#8217;s civil aviation accident bureau BEA said it was &#8220;most likely&#8230; that a&nbsp;fire broke out in the cockpit while the aircraft was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly, resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft&#8221;.</p>



<p>At the time, there was no mention of oxygen leaks or pilots smoking in the cabin.</p>



<p>It was reported the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2611419/egyptair-plane-ms804-may-have-crashed-because-the-pilots-placed-his-iphone-6s-on-the-instrument-panel-causing-it-to-ignite/">EgyptAir flight may have crashed due to a smartphone overheating</a>.</p>

<p>A source from the French aviation probe suggested there could be a &#8220;troubling parallel&#8221; between where the fire broke out in the cockpit and where the co-pilot left his iPhone, according to&nbsp;Le Parisien newspaper.</p>

<p><strong>A FLICKER of normal life has returned to Kyiv as children played in parks surrounded by spring flowers.</strong></p>



<p>Families made the most of the sunshine with mums pushing kids on swings while other ­residents walked freely after months of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18295542/ukrainian-woman-misses-airstrike-inches/">Russian bombardments</a>. </p>

<p>Tensions eased after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18313998/ukraine-russia-ww3-vladimir-putin-nuclear-trump-germany-war/">Russian forces</a> were forced to retreat in a humiliating defeat last month.</p>



<p>But officials told residents to think twice about returning after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> warned it would retaliate with more long-range missile strikes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kyiv’s Mayor <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/17772467/vitali-klitschko-boxing-record-ukraine-wladimir/">Vitali Klitschko</a> ordered the dismantling of an iconic statue which symbolised Russia’s friendship with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p>The eight-metre bronze sculpture of two workers was erected in 1982.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin appeared to limp and grimace as he walked during talks in Moscow with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>



<p>Gesturing to the other end of his ludicrously long table, the tyrant&#8217;s voice appeared soft and slightly shaky yesterday as he invited the top diplomat to take a seat.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18384654" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 422px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/putin1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=412" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18384654" width="412" height="520" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin appeared to limp during a meeting earlier on Tuesday</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<p>In a short video clip shared online, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> is seen walking slowly and appearing to grimace.</p>



<p>He continues his trademark &#8220;gunslinger&#8221; walk with his left arm swinging and his right arm fixed by his side but looks to be in pain and limps.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> head of state brought out the bizarre 13-foot-long table that he has been pictured at in the past few months.</p>



<p>This marked a change from his most recent appearance last week, where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">Putin and his defence chief shared a tiny, almost intimate table</a>.</p>

<p>After acknowledging Mr Guterres&#8217; presence with a minuscule nod of his head, in a strangely soft voice, the Russian leader tells the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/united-nations/">UN</a> chief curtly: &#8220;Good afternoon. Please sit down.&#8221;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/">Putin&#8217;s health has been called into question</a>.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Russia was accused of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18363674/vladimir-putin-fake-easter-service-parkinsons/">faking Putin&#8217;s Easter church service</a> using digitally altered pictures from last year&#8217;s event.</p>



<p>Online sleuths claim the images from 2021 are virtually identical and were re-issued to hide the tyrant&#8217;s&nbsp;failing health.</p>

<p>UN chief Guterres is in Russia to discuss the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine crisis</a> with Putin.</p>



<p>While on his visit, he also met with the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov.</p>



<p>During his one-on-one with Putin, 69, Guterres again stated the UN&#8217;s position on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.</p>



<p>The UN describes the February 24 invasion by Russia as a violation of Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity and going against the UN Charter.</p>

<p>For his part, Putin insisted that Russia won&#8217;t sign any peace deal with Ukraine unless the country first agrees to &#8220;solve the issues of Crimea and the Donbas&#8221;.</p>



<p>This is likely to mean Ukraine surrendering these territories for good.</p>



<p>Crimea was annexed by Russia during the 2014 war.</p>



<p>Mr Guterres and President Putin also discussed proposed humanitarian assistance and civilian evacuation from the conflict zones, in particular the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18336824/images-show-mass-graves-near-mariupol/">besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol</a>.</p>



<p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18332535/ukraines-spartans-mariupol-holding/">Ukrainian troops and civilians remain holed up in the Azovstal steel mill</a> in the blitzed city, according to reports from Ukraine&#8217;s military.</p>



<p>&#8220;The President agreed, in principle, to the involvement of the United Nations and the International Committee for the Red Cross in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol,&#8221; Mr Dujarric said.</p>



<p>Mr Guterres described his talks with Sergey Lavrov as &#8220;a very frank discussion,&#8221; adding that &#8220;it is clear that there are two different positions on what is happening in Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>He went on: &#8220;It is my deep conviction that the sooner we end this war, the better &#8211; for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation, and those far beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ukraine&#8217;s president <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> earlier criticised Guterres for visiting Russia before coming to his country.</p>



<p>&#8220;The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be logical to go first to Ukraine, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation.&#8221;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Moscow also warned it could target British diplomats returning to Kyiv, after the UK&#8217;s &#8220;provocative&#8221; talk of bombing Russia.</p>



<p>The Kremlin issued the chilling threat after Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the UK would back Ukrainian airstrikes on Russia.</p>



<p>He said it would be &#8220;completely legitimate&#8221; for British weapons to be used in these attacks.</p>



<p>In an escalation of the war of words between London and Moscow, Russia&#8217;s defence ministry warned it would be prepared to strike &#8220;decision-making centres&#8221; in Kyiv in retaliation &#8211; even if British and other Western diplomats were there.</p>



<p>It comes after Boris Johnson announced last week that Britain will reopen its embassy in Kyiv two months after staff were evacuated following the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>THE body of a missing 21-year-old woman was discovered tied up and riddled with bullets on a country road in an apparent execution-style killing.</p>



<p>Ellen Nascimento da Silva had left her family&#8217;s home in Brasnorte, west-central <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/">Brazil</a>, on April 19 to visit a friend&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>According to her mother, she left the house at around 9pm carrying nothing but her mobile phone.</p>



<p>She said her daughter had planned to go travelling and had even packed a suitcase, but decided to leave it at home.</p>



<p>It was the last time she would see her daughter alive, and her horrifically wounded body was found dumped on a rural street three days after she left home.</p>



<p>Her hands were bound and her body was covered in gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>AT least five Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin may have been murdered, as the president purges his inner circle of former wealthy allies.</p>



<p>Since the start of the year, four gas industry bosses linked to the tyrant and a top medical executive have died in mysterious circumstances.</p>

<p>But sources believe they may have actually been murdered as it&#8217;s claimed there were similarities in their deaths.</p>



<p>On February 25  &#8211; the day after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Putin</a> ordered his troops into Ukraine &#8211; the body of Alexander Tyulakov, a senior Gazprom financial and security official at the deputy general director level &#8211; was discovered dead by his lover.</p>



<p>The 61-year-old&#8217;s neck was in a noose in his £500,000 home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just three weeks prior &#8211; in the same elite gated housing development in the Leningrad region &#8211; Leonid Shulman, head of transport at Gazprom Invest, was found dead.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old was discovered with multiple stab wounds in a pool of blood on his bathroom floor.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, wealthy Vladislav Avayev, 51, an ex-vice-president of Gazprombank and former Kremlin official,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18302868/russian-banker-found-dead-moscow-gazprombank/">was found shot dead in his elite Moscow penthouse</a>.</p>



<p>And days later, Sergey Protosenya, 55, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18330720/russian-oligarch-wife-daughter-axe/">was found dead by hanging in Spain.</a></p>



<p>Protosenya was a former deputy chairman of Novotek, a company closely linked to the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Here are seven clues which suggest the five may have been murdered amid fears Putin is purging his inner circle as his invasion of Ukraine continues to stall.</p>



<h2 id="similarities-in-deaths">&#8216;SIMILARITIES&#8217; IN DEATHS</h2>



<p>At least four of the alleged suicides have all <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18343407/putin-purge-four-suicides-top-russian-gas-executives/">been labelled as &#8220;suspicious&#8221; by Russian sources</a> &#8211; including a former FSB colonel on the Telegram messaging channel.</p>



<p>Writing on Mozhem Obyasnit &#8211; which means We Can Explain &#8211; Gennady Gudkov claimed there were similarities in the passing of top managers and their families from senior gas companies.</p>



<p>He claimed: &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the &#8216;rats&#8217; escape, they might talk.</p>



<p>“If we already understand that the regime is engaged in the elimination of its opponents and enemies, then why will they not deal with those who are considered traitors who have fled the system.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many cases of [suspicious deaths] are like settling scores.”</p>



<figure id="attachment_18352544" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727929357-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18352544" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Former Kremlin official and Gazprombank vice-president Vladislav Avayev was found dead by his daughter[/caption]



<h2 id="families-found-dead">FAMILIES FOUND DEAD<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18343407/putin-purge-four-suicides-top-russian-gas-executives/#"></a></h2>



<p>In the two most recent macabre incidents, the families of the two oligarchs have been killed &#8211; raising suspicions that the &#8220;suicides&#8221; were staged.</p>



<p>Vladislav Avayev, 51, was found shot dead along with his wife Yelena, 47, and his 13-year-old daughter Maria at their home in Moscow.</p>



<p>The bodies were discovered by Avayecv&#8217;s eldest daughter Anastasia, 26, alongside&nbsp;a total of 13 different weapons.</p>



<p>A law enforcement source said that a gun was found in Avayev&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>Kremlin analyst Olga Lautman said that Avayev previously worked in&nbsp;Putin&#8217;s presidential administration, as well as in the parliament, or Duma.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a chilling echo of Avayev&#8217;s death, Russian tycoon Sergey Protosenya, 55, his wife Natalya, 53, and his 18-year-old daughter Maria were discovered dead at their luxury Spanish villa.</p>



<p>Protosenya, who boasted a fortune of over £333million, did not leave a suicide note before allegedly hanging himself in the courtyard.</p>



<p>Natalia and Maria had been hacked to death in their beds with an axe in the Lloret de Mar on Spain’s Costa Brava, according to reports.</p>



<p>Police found the gruesome scene after the couple&#8217;s teenage son, who was in France at the time, raised concerns.</p>



<p>Alleged inconsistencies at the crime scene and the coincidental death of two gas oligarchs and their families in a matter of days have raised suspicions.</p>

<h2 id="oligarch-badly-beaten-before-death">OLIGARCH &#8216;BADLY BEATEN&#8217; BEFORE DEATH</h2>



<p>Just one day after Putin invaded Ukraine, the body of Gazprom deputy general director Alexander Tyulakov was found.</p>



<p>His hung body was discovered by his lover in his £500,000 home in Leningrad.</p>



<p>But according to reports, he had been badly beaten before his death &#8211; raising speculation over how he died.</p>

<p>In the same gated housing development in the Leningrad region, Leonid Shulman &#8211; head of transport at Gazprom Invest &#8211; was found dead on January 29.</p>



<p>He was discovered with multiple stab wounds in a pool of blood on his bathroom floor.</p>



<p>A note was found, the contents of which have not been disclosed, and the Russian Investigative Committee reportedly refused to discuss the deaths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s reported a knife was found in the bathtub, seemingly out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suspicions have been raised over the five deaths as they come amid a shake-up in ownership in Russian business.</p>



<p>The change was triggered by Western sanctions which have frozen many fortunes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineer and economist Protosenya had been chief accountant of Novatek company, the largest independent producer of natural gas in Russia, between 2002 and 2014, and later vice president.</p>



<p>He had a fortune of $440 million, it is claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Novatek is co-owned by close Putin friend Gennady Timchenko and the privileged giant had been recently excluded from the Kremlin leader’s edict to trade energy only in rubles.</p>



<p>The company is also closely linked to Pyotr Kolbin, a Putin childhood&nbsp;friend, allegedly a “shadow holder of Putin&#8217;s wealth”.</p>



<p>“So, under strange and similar circumstances, the families of managers of two key private companies managing the money of Putin&#8217;s entourage died,” stated&nbsp;Mozhem Obyasnit.</p>

<p>Last month, the bodies of Russian billionaire Vasily Melnikov and his wife and two sons were discovered in his luxury apartment in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, 250 miles east of Moscow.</p>



<p>All died from stab wounds, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant.</p>



<p>The paper quoted police investigators, who said they had determined that Melnikov killed his family before committing suicide.</p>



<p>However, neighbours and relatives have since come forward and said they struggle to believe Melnikov could have done something so evil.</p>



<p>The businessman had been an executive at medical firm MedStom, which had suffered greatly as a result of economic sanctions placed on Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian publication Glavred.</p>

<p>The 66-year-old was found hanged at his £18m home on the exclusive Wentworth Estate in Virginia Water.</p>



<p>A neighbour of Mikhail claimed he had told her that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17837907/russia-ukraine-mikhail-watford-putin-hit-list-fears/">Putin had put him on a hit list</a>.</p>



<p>She also said Mr Watford, known as Misha, had been a pal of Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky, found hanged at his home in Ascot, Berks, in 2013.</p>

<p>A BOSS has divided opinion by putting up a sign telling employees that &#8220;work is not meant to be fun&#8221; alongside a minion character.</p>



<p>The tongue-in-cheek poster received a cold reception on social blogging forum <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/reddit/">Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>The poster read: &#8220;Came into work this morning to find this taped to the wall.</p>



<p>&#8220;Boss went on tirade against me and co-worker yesterday for talking to each other with no customers in the store.&#8221;</p>



<p>The blunt sign reminded staff to &#8220;not dedicate work time to discussion of non-work topics&#8221;.</p>



<p>It went on: &#8220;Do not facilitate friendships during work hours.</p>

<p>The poster elicited quite the reaction online.</p>



<p>&#8220;We expect you to be miserable here. But don&#8217;t forget to smile!&#8221; wrote one Reddit user.</p>

<p>The self-declared &#8220;mean&#8221; manager who issued the demanding list has been accused of &#8220;abusing her power&#8221; by stunned social media users.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every shift is to do all shift duties I will be watching cameras all day every day!!!,&#8221; one of the orders says.</p>



<p>Others tell workers not to use their phones, have food while on duty or be late.</p>



<p>At the end of the rules, the manager declared she is &#8220;over trying to be nice&#8221;.</p>

<p>A BRIT couple found dead in a suspected murder-suicide have been pictured.</p>

<p>They dreamt of opening a bed and breakfast at the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains near Toulouse in the south of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/">France</a>, but ran out of money.</p>



<p>Concerned friends <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18371128/brit-couple-murdered-france-home-chilling-note/">found them dead in their home</a> in Boudrac, a small village with 130 people, on Sunday after they went missing for several days.</p>



<p>John and Kathryn bought their former holiday home for £200,000 last summer and planned to transform it into a bed and breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money problems stopped the project after they spend months and all their savings converting the home and out-house into guest accommodation.&nbsp;</p>
