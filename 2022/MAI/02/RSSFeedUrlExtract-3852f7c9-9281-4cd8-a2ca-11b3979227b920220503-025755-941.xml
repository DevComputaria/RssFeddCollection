      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Ecology Minister Roberto Cingolani’s comments come as 10 EU countries are reportedly prepared to buy gas in Russian currency</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Italian Minister of Ecological Transition Roberto Cingolani told Politico on Monday that Italian companies should <em>&ldquo;go ahead and pay in rubles&rdquo;</em> for Russian gas, as Moscow has demanded. Although his ministry later said that it does not back such a move, 10 EU nations are reportedly planning to do the same.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I think it would be good for a few months, at least, to allow companies to go ahead and pay in rubles, while we understand the legal framework and implications,&rdquo;</em> Cingolani <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-eu-energy-pay-russia-gas-rubles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, adding that he wants <em>&ldquo;a speedy and very clear pronouncement from the European Commission&rdquo;</em> on whether such an arrangement would breach EU sanctions.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Shortly afterwards, Cingolani&rsquo;s ministry issued a statement saying that the minister <em>&ldquo;has never been open to a payment in rubles.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>However, Italy depends on Russia for around 40% of its gas imports, and Cingolani said that while oil and gas companies <em>&ldquo;cannot risk&rdquo;</em> paying and breaking sanctions, they also <em>&ldquo;cannot risk &hellip; not paying&rdquo;</em> until recently-signed gas contracts with African countries come into effect.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded in March that <em>&ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo;</em> countries &ndash; those that back sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia&rsquo;s military offensive in Ukraine &ndash; would have to pay for gas in Russia&rsquo;s national currency. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off after they refused this demand.</p>

<p><strong></strong>However, Hungary has opened a euro account with Russia&rsquo;s Gazprombank for purchasing Russian gas. These euro payments are then converted into rubles by the bank, and transferred to gas suppliers in Russia, fulfilling the contract. Hungarian government official Gergely Gulyas told the public radio on Sunday that nine other EU countries were preparing the same payment scheme and not announcing it publicly.</p>
<p><strong></strong>A report by Bloomberg last week claimed that four EU states have already paid for gas by this mechanism.</p>
<p><strong></strong>It is unclear whether this setup breaches EU sanctions on Russia, as European buyers are technically not sending rubles to Russia. Cingolani said that EU companies could regard the transfer of euros to Gazprombank as the <em>&ldquo;final transaction,&rdquo;</em> while Russian suppliers would consider the deal done upon receipt of rubles.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;In this process there are gray areas, which could constitute a breach of sanctions. However you do it, there is a problem,&rdquo;</em> he stated.</p>
<p><strong></strong>EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Politico that the commission would <em>&ldquo;issue more detailed guidance on what companies can and cannot do within our sanctions framework&rdquo;</em> soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US tech giant has been barring third-party app developers from accessing contactless payment technologies, the EU argues</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The EU Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Apple on Monday over the US tech giant&rsquo;s supposedly abusive practices in the field of mobile wallets technology. The company has been using its <em>&ldquo;dominant position&rdquo;</em> in the market to bar third-party services from accessing software and hardware on its devices facilitating contactless payments, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a> states.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple&rsquo;s devices,&rdquo;</em> the EU Commission&rsquo;s competition policy head, Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, said, adding that the EU had preliminary data suggesting the US company might have restricted competition to benefit Apple Pay.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If confirmed, such a conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,&rdquo;</em> Vestager warned.</p>

<p>The hardware and software in question, jointly known as the near-field communication technology or NFC, allows interaction with payment terminals in stores and helps people make purchases with a quick tap. According to the European regulators, Apple bars PayPal and other similar services from accessing it on iPhones and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Apple will now have the opportunity to respond or challenge this assessment before the final judgment is announced. If it fails to reach a settlement with the EU, it can be fined up to 10% of its global revenue, which might equal $36 billion.</p>
<p>So far, the company has denied any wrongdoing. <em>&ldquo;Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,&rdquo;</em> it said in a Monday statement, adding that it would continue to work with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>The EU, in turn, has said that the Statement of Objections <em>&ldquo;does not prejudge the outcome of an investigation.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This is not the first time the US tech giant has faced antitrust accusations in the EU. Last year, the bloc brought similar charges against the company following a complaint by Spotify and some other services about the 30% commission Apple imposes on any purchases made inside the apps allowed on its devices. The case is still pending.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Italy fined Apple and Amazon some $230 million over what it called anti-competitive cooperation in sales on Amazon&rsquo;s Italian platform. The two tech giants struck a deal back in 2018 allowing certain resellers to sell Apple products and Beats electronic accessories on Amazon, thus affecting completion and prices, according to the national antitrust authority.</p>
<p>In June 2021, Germany&rsquo;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO) launched a probe into the Apple Store&rsquo;s operations, arguing it <em>&ldquo;empowers Apple to influence the operations of third parties.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Despite their warm fuzzy packaging and seemingly altruistic intentions, mental health and prayer apps are &ldquo;<em>worse than any other product</em>&rdquo; when it comes to user privacy and security, an analysis by browser firm Mozilla revealed on Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The vast majority of mental health and prayer apps are exceptionally creepy</em>,&rdquo; Mozilla&rsquo;s Jen Caltrider, the primary creator of the firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Privacy not Included</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/mental-health-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a>, which evaluated 32 such apps on their respect for users&rsquo; personal data, told the Verge on Monday. Caltrider noted that the apps one might think would recognize the sensitive nature of their data instead &ldquo;<em>track, share, and capitalize on users&rsquo; most intimate personal thoughts and feelings, like moods, mental state, and biometric data.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps slurping up biometric data and other seemingly private information are nothing new, but given the assumption of privacy that comes with the real-life relationship between a therapist and patient, or a believer and religious institution, one might hope that app developers would at least attempt to replicate such safe spaces when taking the whole process online.</p>
<p>However, the Privacy not Included guide found that out of 32 such apps, fully 29 received a privacy warning label, noting that they either stored large amounts of personal data under vague privacy policies or otherwise maintained poor security practices, such as weak passwords. One popular app, Talkspace, stashes entire chat transcripts between user and therapist. Another, an AI therapy chatbot called Woebot, actually collects information about users from third parties, then shares it for advertising purposes, all while pretending to be their silicon shoulder to cry on.</p>

<p>Mozillla researcher Misha Rykov referred to the apps his team analyzed as &ldquo;<em>data-sucking machines with a mental health app veneer</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</em>.&rdquo; But with real-life therapy increasingly expensive and the process of finding a therapist who 'matches' a patient hit or miss, the lure of a friendly voice just a click away is difficult to resist for some. But given the apps&rsquo; apparent core purpose of data mining and selling users&rsquo; deepest darkest secrets, it might be a better idea to hold one&rsquo;s tongue until one can meet up with a qualified therapist or at least a trusted friend &ndash; ideally in real life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>An officer who shot to death two people in Paris on election night has been charged with murder</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Hundreds of members of French police unions turned out for protests on Monday after one of their number was arrested over the shooting to death of two people in a car on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris on the election night of April 24. The three police unions, Alliance, Synergie, and Unsa-Police, declared the decision to arrest their colleague &ldquo;<em>inadmissible</em>&rdquo; and pledged to take to the streets to air their grievances across 40 cities, focusing their efforts on courts and police stations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the largest gathering was set to take place on the Place Saint-Michel, close to the location of the shooting on the Pont-Neuf. Seemingly concerned that the government cannot be relied upon to back actions taken in the line of duty, the police are demanding the establishment of a &ldquo;<em>presumption of self-defense.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the fateful evening, the officer in question fired his rifle at the car on the bridge in central Paris when it failed to stop for a checkpoint. Two occupants of the car died at the scene and a third was injured. The officer claimed to have fired in self-defense. Local media coverage has not mentioned whether any of the occupants of the car were armed or otherwise posed a threat to the officer, and details around the case remain uncertain.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old officer was immediately taken in for questioning by the internal investigation agency. Prosecutors have suggested that it was likely he used excessive force. The police report confirmed the number of shots fired, with five or six bullets hitting the victims out of the 12 or so rounds fired, according to the news agency AFP. The officer has been charged with &ldquo;<em>deliberate homicide</em>&rdquo; of the driver of the vehicle, &ldquo;<em>deliberate violence by a person holding public authority resulting in death without intention of giving it</em>&rdquo; regarding the front-seat passenger, who was also killed, and &ldquo;<em>violence voluntarily aggregated by a person holding public authority</em>&rdquo; with regard to the back-seat passenger, who was injured but survived.</p>

<p>Not long after the cops took to the streets, counter-protesters joined the fray in some locations, denouncing police violence and accusing the officers of being murderers. Tensions between the authorities and the population have run high for years in France. Weeks of Yellow Vest protests gave way to demonstrations against Covid-19 restrictions and now anti-Macron election protests. Dozens were arrested on Sunday as well at May Day protests and demonstrations against Macron&rsquo;s reelection.<em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The network has flagged 11 articles that contained plagiarized information</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>NBC News apologized to its readers on Monday for eleven articles over the past year that contained plagiarized passages. The network did not retract the stories, however, but removed the problematic paragraphs and added editors&rsquo; notes to them. The Comcast-owned network also didn't name the reporter at fault. Other outlets were not so circumspect, however.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The eleven articles <em>&ldquo;contained passages from other news organizations that were used without attribution,&rdquo;</em> NBC said in a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/note-readers-rcna26934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. <em>&ldquo;In all cases, the passages were not central to the stories, but instead contained supplemental or background material that did not represent original reporting.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;An editor&rsquo;s note has been placed on each of the articles, and the passages that were plagiarized have been removed,&rdquo;</em> NBC added, without naming the reporter or revealing their fate with the company.</p>
<p><strong></strong>CNN&rsquo;s Oliver Darcy soon did both, however. <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that NBC discovered this during a routine editing process and launched a review where other instances were discovered,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1521192240831475712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. <em>&ldquo;The reporter, Teaganne Finn, is no longer with the network.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Finn previously worked at Bloomberg News as a breaking news reporter, and was hired by NBC to cover US politics in June 2021. Prior to her work at Bloomberg, she had interned on the investigations team of the Washington Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The figures came from a background briefing at the Pentagon on Monday, where an unnamed American defense official gave reporters the official account of Washington&rsquo;s military aid to Kiev.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Biden <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553837-pentagon-weapons-list-ukraine/">initially promised</a> Ukraine 18 howitzers, but later added another 72, along with 140,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition, ten counter-artillery radars, two air surveillance radars, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers, 100 humvees and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the Pentagon, half of the 155mm ammunition is already in Ukrainian hands, and more is headed over every day. A total of 72 howitzers have been delivered, along with &ldquo;nearly all&rdquo; the radars. A total of 14 cargo flights departed the US over the past 24 hours, and 11 more are expected over the next day, along with 23 flights from five other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>These supply flights reportedly land in Poland, from where the weapons are taken across the Ukrainian border by road and rail.</p>

<p>The Pentagon also revealed that the training of Ukrainian troops on the new howitzers is taking place in Germany. Florida National Guard troops based there, which had previously deployed to Ukraine for training, have taken over the howitzer drills from original Canadian instructors. More than 170 Ukrainian troops have already been trained in handling the M777s, and another 50 are completing their training, the official said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>A group of 20 Ukrainians have started a week-long training course in using the Phoenix Ghost tactical drones, the official added. However, the Mi-17 helicopters have yet to be delivered to Kiev.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Another detail disclosed by the Pentagon is that Ukraine has so far received 5,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles. The US military has been raiding its own stockpiles for both the Javelins and the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as their manufacturer, Raytheon, <a href="http://v">complained last week</a> the components to make more were in short supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Since February 24, the US has pledged nearly $15 billion in military aid to Kiev, more than double Ukraine&rsquo;s entire military budget for 2021. Last week, Congress <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554628-congress-lend-lease-ukraine/">approved a bill</a> that would enable the White House to send nearly unlimited quantities and types of weapons and ammunition using a WWII-era <em>&ldquo;lend-lease&rdquo;</em> mechanism.</p>
<p><strong></strong>According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian armed forces have lost 1,246 artillery weapons, not counting multiple rocket launcher systems, since the start of the hostilities. Russia has also repeatedly targeted warehouses storing equipment sent from the West.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Surging inflation in the UK appears to be behind the growth of casket-renting services</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Cash-strapped Brits are renting temporary coffins for funeral services before having their loved ones buried in cardboard, the Sun reported on Monday. Funeral directors say the cost-saving measure is becoming more popular as Brits struggle with a skyrocketing cost of living.</p>
<p>A temporary coffin is obtained for the day of the funeral and is returned afterward. The deceased is placed into a cheap and lightweight &lsquo;inner&rsquo; coffin, which sits inside the rented casket. This outer coffin is then removed after the service, leaving the body to be interred inside the lighter one.</p>
<p>The average cost of renting a coffin is &pound;250 ($312), the Sun <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18427252/cost-of-living-crisis-rent-coffins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>, much below the &pound;750 ($937) price tag for buying a casket outright.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are many ways to keep the cost of a funeral within a budget, while making it special,&rdquo;</em> a spokesman for the National Association of Funeral Directors told the British tabloid. <em>"Provided it is clear what is being provided, this is one of several choices available that may assist families.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While one manufacturer of rental coffins told the Sun that her company&rsquo;s products should be seen as no different from renting a wedding dress, an <em>&ldquo;industry insider&rdquo;</em> told the tabloid that <em>&ldquo;this move is the latest sign the living costs crisis is literally becoming a killer issue.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>"This rental coffin market is saving families thousands of pounds, but it&rsquo;s sad they must come to terms with the fact their loved one isn&rsquo;t in an enclosed casket,&rdquo;</em> the source said.</p>

This 12-month rate is the highest since March 1992. Energy costs have <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9428/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soared</a> even higher in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine and Britain&rsquo;s decision to cut itself off from Russian energy imports, as households are now paying 28% more for gas and 19% more for electricity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 83% of adults in the UK <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/articles/impactofincreasedcostoflivingonadultsacrossgreatbritain/november2021tomarch2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> an increase in their cost of living in March.&nbsp; Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility <a href="https://obr.uk/box/developments-in-the-outlook-for-household-living-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> that real household incomes would fall by 2.2% this year, and that Britons would experience the largest fall in living standards since records began in 1956.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Companies are supplying intelligence to NATO, Kiev, and the media, the Wall Street Journal reported</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A host of private companies have deployed spy satellites over Ukraine to track the movement of Russian forces from space, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Some sell this data to Western governments and media outlets, while others send it directly to the government in Kiev. With the line between observation and participation blurred, many of the firms are keeping their work quiet.</p>
<p>When outlets such as the Journal publish aerial photos from Ukraine, they&rsquo;re not relying on spy satellites operated by the US and its allies. Instead they&rsquo;re paying private firms to do this surveillance work, with the newspaper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-puts-spy-satellites-for-hire-in-the-spotlight-11651410002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> that it buys imagery directly from Maxar Technologies.</p>
<p>Maxar&rsquo;s satellites, the report&nbsp;stated, can take photographs from space with a resolution down to 12 inches. However, such companies are not just deploying their satellites to help the Western media land scoops but are also supplying military intelligence to Ukraine and NATO allies, which is then being used by Kiev to target Russian forces.</p>

<p>According to the report, Planet Labs PBC and HawkEye 360 are tracking Russian troop movements, with the former relaying this information to the Pentagon. MDA, a space technology company, says it&rsquo;s working with other companies to supply imagery to the Ukrainian government, while BlackSky Technology, which tracks radio signals, is reportedly supplying data to unnamed <em>&ldquo;customers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Although less sophisticated than the kind of satellites operated by state-level actors, some of these privately-operated eyes in the sky can see through clouds and function at night.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has not commented on the extent of its use of <em>&ldquo;commercial satellite imagery services,&rdquo;</em> but these services were funded as part of a package of military aid to Ukraine announced last month. Moreover, the US has openly admitted to sharing military intelligence with Ukraine, and reportedly <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554643-us-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded</a> the scope of this sharing last month.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that <em>&ldquo;many companies declined to be specific about how they are assisting Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> fearing that they could be seen as direct participants in the conflict. Even the White House previously held back on sharing <em>&ldquo;actionable information&rdquo;</em> with Kiev,<em> &ldquo;because that steps over the line to making us participating in the war,&rdquo;</em> Congressman Adam Smith (D-Washington), who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some companies are open about their support for Ukraine. Satellogic, an Argentinian firm feeding data to Kiev, described its role as <em>&ldquo;helping the cause,&rdquo;</em> and has partnered with the Halifax International Security Forum to fundraise for more satellite surveillance for Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian government has not commented on Ukraine and the West&rsquo;s use of private spy satellites in Ukraine. However, the Kremlin has taken a dim view of Western arms shipments to Ukraine, calling them <em>&ldquo;legitimate targets&rdquo;</em> and destroying several warehouses of them with missile strikes.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described the West&rsquo;s response to its operation in Ukraine as NATO <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy,&rdquo;</em> while President Vladimir Putin has warned that any outside interference in the conflict that puts Russia&rsquo;s security at risk would be met with a <em>&ldquo;swift, lightning-fast&rdquo;</em> response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Disputed island is looking to emulate Kiev if it squares off with Beijing, the foreign minister says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Taiwan has observed the conflict in Ukraine and drawn several lessons for its own confrontation with mainland China, the disputed island&rsquo;s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told CNN in an interview aired on Sunday.</p>
<p>Wu argued that Beijing is hesitant to move on the island due to what he described as Russia&rsquo;s lack of progress in Ukraine and the international community&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>Taiwan is <em>&ldquo;watching this very carefully,&rdquo;</em> Wu&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2022/05/01/exp-gps-0501-wu-on-what-taiwans-learned-from-ukraine.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told CNN&rsquo;</a>s Fareed Zakaria. <em>&ldquo;We try to see what we can learn from Ukraine in defending ourselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Wu described Ukraine as being <em>&ldquo;on the frontline against Russia&rsquo;s outward expansion,&rdquo;</em> and accused Russia of using the military <em>&ldquo;for its historical glory,&rdquo;</em> in what he said was a parallel to the China-Taiwan situation.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s two big takeaways from the conflict are that Ukraine is using <em>&ldquo;small personal weapons to go against a large enemy,&rdquo;</em> and that its male population is highly motivated. <em>&ldquo;They want to serve in the military. They want to go to the war zones to fight against Russia. That kind of spirit is enviable for the Taiwanese people,&rdquo;</em> Wu said.</p>
<p>Wu&rsquo;s emphasis on <em>&ldquo;asymmetric capability,&rdquo;</em> such as Javelin and NLAW anti-tank rockets &ndash; widely promoted as wonder-weapons in Ukraine &ndash; is consistent with President Tsai Ing-wen&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s focus on such armaments. Tsai also hopes Washington would come to Taiwan&rsquo;s aid directly, she told CNN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/538658-taiwan-us-defend-china/">in October</a>.</p>

]]><![CDATA[
    

<p><em>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a war, we need friends and allies to support Taiwan, as in the case of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Wu told Zakaria, pointing to how the US, EU, and Japan came together to support Kiev.</p>
<p>Though the US has not sent troops to Ukraine, Washington is pouring money and weapons into the country <em>&ldquo;to fight against Russia,&rdquo;</em> Wu noted. <em>&ldquo;I think the Chinese government must be thinking or calculating how the US or other major countries are going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help or whether they&rsquo;re going to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s help. If Taiwan does not have any support, I think that&rsquo;s going to be a green light to aggression.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554646-liz-truss-nato-ukraine-taiwan/">a speech</a> last week that <em>&ldquo;a Global NATO&rdquo;</em> needs to arm Taiwan just as it has armed Ukraine, among other things. The day before CNN aired the interview with Wu, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0991186-d511-45c2-b5f0-9bd5b8ceee40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a> reported that the White House officials in charge of China and the Indo-Pacific have met with British colleagues to explore contingency plans about Taiwan.</p>
<p>Wu also argued that Ukraine&rsquo;s ability to hold off Russia &ndash; which he attributed to <em>&ldquo;the desire to defend the country and the willingness to use personal weapons&rdquo;</em> &ndash; is giving Beijing reason to worry.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If they are not able to take Taiwan over quickly, I think they need to pause and think twice before they act,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Beijing considers Taiwan part of China&rsquo;s sovereign territory. Since 1949, the island has been ruled by the remnants of the nationalist government, which fled the mainland after defeat in the civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Both US parties are losing faith in their leaders’ ability to right the economic ship</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Fewer than half of US adults have &ldquo;<em>a great deal</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>a fair amount</em>&rdquo; of confidence in the abilities of Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, US President Joe Biden, or either party&rsquo;s congressional leaders to do &ldquo;<em>the right thing</em>&rdquo; for the economy, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392306/confidence-economic-leaders-flagging.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a> conducted by Gallup during the first three weeks of April and published on Monday.</p>
<p>Equally troublingly, nearly half have &ldquo;<em>almost no</em>&rdquo; confidence in these figures, who have repeatedly dangled rosy predictions of economic recovery in the face of a gross domestic product that actually declined for the first quarter of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powell leads the pack, with 43% of respondents expressing confidence in his abilities, while Biden trails at 40%, tied with Republican leaders in Congress and two points ahead of their Democratic counterparts (38%). Those numbers have fallen precipitously over the past year as the inflation rate has more than doubled to its highest rate in over four decades. Despite reassuring words from their leaders, more and more Americans are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392162/personal-finance-ratings-slide-amid-rising-prices.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggling</a> to make ends meet, with many <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/392159/inflation-concerns-fueling-low-economic-confidence.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerned</a> there is no end in sight to the nation&rsquo;s fiscal predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As leaders&rsquo; favorable ratings have shrunk, negative public opinion has surged, with fully 43% of respondents &ndash; irrespective of party lines &ndash; claiming they had almost no confidence in Biden to do the right thing for the economy. Powell fared slightly better &ndash; possibly due to lack of name recognition &ndash; with 10% of respondents expressing no opinion about him, although 22% said they had no faith in his abilities either. Democrats in Congress inspired similar revulsion from 42% of respondents, while Republicans got away with 30% expressing almost no confidence in their abilities.</p>

<p>When broken down along party lines, both parties saw their approval ratings inflate significantly. A whopping 80% of Democrats expressed confidence in Biden, and 77% in their party&rsquo;s congressional leaders. Even 61% expressed confidence in Powell, a Trump appointee who has continued to lead the Fed under Biden. Republicans were much less charitable, with just 8% expressing confidence in Biden, but 66% supported their party&rsquo;s leaders in Congress. Just 31% of the party had confidence in Powell, who has struggled to control inflation after initially denying it was a major issue.</p>
<p>Independents, who make up a growing percentage of the American political body, expressed low confidence in both parties, with just 36% believing in Biden to do the right thing economically and 38% expressing faith in Powell. About a third support the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress (32% and 34%, respectively).</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s approval rating has fallen by 17 points over the last year, according to the pollster, while Powell&rsquo;s has dropped 12 points and Democratic members of Congress have lost 11 points. Republicans fared comparatively well, gaining one point in confidence, though the previous year&rsquo;s results had placed them at the bottom of the heap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s current rating places him below even his predecessor Donald Trump, whose confidence rating dipped to 42% before reversing course in 2018.

            <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Defense Minister Margarita Robles had their mobile phones targeted with Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, Minister of the Presidency Felix Bolanos said on Monday. It is unknown who deployed the malware, but Catalan independence leaders have also accused the Spanish government of using it against them.</p>
<p>Bolanos told a press conference that Sanchez&rsquo; phone had been infected in May 2021, and that at least one data leak had occurred, Reuters reported.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The interventions were illicit and external. External means carried out by non-official bodies and without state authorization,&rdquo;</em> he said, without disclosing whether foreign or Spanish groups are thought to have been behind the operation.</p>

<p>Pegasus is a sophisticated hacking tool developed by an Israeli firm, NSO Group, and sold to state-level clients around the world. Its widespread activity was revealed last summer by Amnesty International and more than a dozen media organizations, and those targeted by the spyware include top political leaders like British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554119-pegasus-spying-europe-catalonia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boris Johnson</a>, who a recent report claims was targeted for surveillance by hackers based in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Around 50,000 phones worldwide have been illegally accessed using the malware, with targets including journalists, activists, businesspeople and political figures. The Israeli software grants the hacker the ability to read messages, look through photos, track the person&rsquo;s location, and even switch on the camera without the knowledge of the phone&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p>In Spain, more than 60 phones linked to Catalan independence activists were reportedly breached between 2015 and 2020, with those targeted including members of the European Parliament, Catalan presidents, legislators, jurists, and members of civil society organizations, according to a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/catalangate-extensive-mercenary-spyware-operation-against-catalans-using-pegasus-candiru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> last month by cyber research firm Citizen Lab.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Every Catalan Member of the European Parliament (MEP) that supported independence was targeted either directly with Pegasus, or via suspected relational targeting,&rdquo;</em> Citizen Lab said. <em>&ldquo;Three MEPs were directly infected, two more had staff, family members, or close associates targeted with Pegasus.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While the culprits remain unknown, Catalan politicians have blamed the Spanish government. Previous <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/2020-07-15/los-servicios-de-informacion-tienen-programas-como-el-que-espio-a-torrent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> in local media accused Spain&rsquo;s National Intelligence Center of using Pegasus to snoop on the separatists since 2015, under the governments of Sanchez and his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy.</p>
<p>Sanchez&rsquo; government has not taken responsibility for spying on the Catalonians, and said that it would investigate the allegations. NSO Group denied the claims unequivocally, telling the New Yorker <em>&ldquo;These allegations are, yet again, false,&rdquo;</em> having previously rebutted similar accusations. Despite a litany of other spying claims in the past, the company has insisted its products are used exclusively for legal law enforcement purposes only.</p>

                            <p><strong>Finnish President Sauli Niinisto will reportedly voice his support for accession into the Western military alliance on May 12</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finland will announce its intention to join NATO on May 12, in a bid to speed up the process of applying to the military bloc, Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported on Monday, citing multiple sources.</p>
<p>According to the outlet, President Sauli Niinisto will announce his support for joining the alliance in the morning. Later that day, his announcement will be followed &ldquo;<em>in the spirit of parliamentarism</em>&rdquo; by the parliamentary groups giving their approval as well.</p>
<p>The date of May 12 was chosen because the various parliamentary committees were already planning to discuss foreign and security matters on that day. Prime Minister Sanna Marin has also approved the date for the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The position is that Finland is applying for membership,</em>&rdquo; Iltalehti said.</p>
<p>The text of the decision, which apparently has already been prepared, will then be approved by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign and Security Policy, submitted to the parliament, and passed on to NATO for consideration.</p>
<p>These arrangements, the newspaper said, will speed up the process, avoid a parliamentary vote, and take the application to NATO &ldquo;<em>at high speed</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finland, which shares a border with Russia, and Sweden, both being EU members, have so far opted to remain outside of NATO and maintain neutral status.</p>

<p>Recent polls in both countries, however, reveal that the Russian military offensive in Ukraine has shifted public opinion, with more respondents now supporting the idea of membership in NATO than in recent years. The changes prompted Stockholm and Helsinki to reconsider their non-alignment policies.</p>
<p>Earlier media reports suggest that Sweden and Finland were planning to simultaneously submit membership applications to NATO in mid-May. The Swedish parliament is now conducting an overview of its security policy.</p>
<p>In early April, the alliance&rsquo;s head, Jens Stoltenberg, said NATO &ldquo;<em>will warmly welcome</em>&rdquo; Finland and Sweden if they apply to join, and is prepared to make a decision on membership &ldquo;<em>quite quickly</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, who previously expressed concerns over potential retaliation from Russia, said recently that the NATO countries have been &ldquo;<em>very actively</em>&rdquo; offering Helsinki &ldquo;<em>both diplomatic and security assistance</em>&rdquo; for the period of the application process.</p>
<p>Russia considers the further expansion of NATO to be a direct threat to its own national security, and &ldquo;<em>for the whole architecture of security.</em>&rdquo; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned in April that Moscow would &ldquo;<em>take additional measures</em>&rdquo; to make its defenses on the Western flank &ldquo;<em>more sophisticated</em>&rdquo; if Finland and Sweden join the bloc.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following its failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>More than 3 million refugees have been taken in by Poland, UN data shows</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>More than 5.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia&rsquo;s military attack on the country began in February, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The data is compiled using a variety of sources, including numbers provided by the authorities at official border crossing points, the agency said.</p>
<p>According to the UN, Poland has taken over 3 million people from Ukraine. Romania has been the second largest recipient of Ukrainian refugees, taking in over 800,000, the data show. Meanwhile, almost 700,000 people have fled to Russia, while more than half a million have been accommodated by Hungary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UNHCR said last week that a further 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. According to the agency, 13 million people overall are estimated to be stranded in affected areas of the country, unable to leave due to<em> &ldquo;heightened security risks,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;destruction of bridges and roads,&rdquo;</em> and a lack of information on where to find safety and accommodation.</p>

                            <p><strong>The move would give Greg Abbott broader state powers to tackle the flow of migrants at the US border</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott is weighing a plan to invoke real war powers by declaring an<em> &ldquo;invasion&rdquo;</em> at the US southern border to get around a clause in the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Abbott could declare an invasion to comply with a clause in the US Constitution which prohibits states from engaging in war unless they were <em>&ldquo;actually invaded.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lawyers for Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton met earlier this month to debate the plan, which would directly challenge the federal government, the New York Times reported. It would allow Texas state police to arrest and deport migrants, two people familiar with the discussion told the paper.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If we do use this strategy, it could expose law enforcement in the state of Texas to being prosecuted,&rdquo;</em> Abbott said during a press conference last week, confirming that he was<em> &ldquo;looking into&rdquo;</em> the idea.</p>

<p>Abbott has already mobilized thousands of National Guard troops and previously ordered checks of trucks arriving from Mexico. He backtracked on the vehicle inspections after truckers blockaded border bridges in protests, disrupting food supplies and threatening more economic losses.</p>
<p>The governor has also ramped up funding for law enforcement in border towns, directing more than $3 billion to border security overall. He has also overseen the construction of miles of new fencing.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called Abbott&rsquo;s actions a <em>&ldquo;publicity stunt&rdquo;</em> last month.</p>
<p>Texas recorded almost 129,000 migrant crossings into Texas in March, roughly 11,000 more than during the same month last year. Officials expect the numbers to rise again when the Biden administration ends the pandemic policy of turning some people away at the border under the Title 42 public health rule.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the administration&rsquo;s handling of the border issue last week, telling Congress that it inherited<em> &ldquo;a broken and dismantled system&rdquo;</em> from the Trump administration, but had <em>&ldquo;effectively managed an unprecedented number of noncitizens seeking to enter the United States.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A government spokesman said Budapest will not back a ban on Russian oil and gas</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Hungary has denied a report in the German media which claims that the country is prepared to support an EU ban on Russian oil and gas in response to Moscow&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Budapest affirmed its stance on the matter after German public broadcaster ZDF quoted sources as saying that <em>&ldquo;hesitant&rdquo;</em> countries, such as Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, have <em>&ldquo;withdrawn their veto.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Hungarian government&rsquo;s international spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, tweeted on Monday: <em>&ldquo;No, dear editors at ZDF, Hungary did not &lsquo;move away from its veto&rsquo;. In fact, Hungary&rsquo;s stance on oil and gas sanctions [from] Russia remains unchanged: We do not support them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hungary, which relies heavily on Russian energy imports, has warned that cutting off supplies from Moscow will hurt its economy.<em> &ldquo;We must not adopt sanctions with which we primarily penalize ourselves instead of those we want to sanction,&rdquo;</em> Gergely Gulyas, the prime minister&rsquo;s chief of staff, told Kossuth Radio on Sunday. He explained that his country has been experiencing higher than expected inflation, and is interested in continuing to receive <em>&ldquo;energy at the cheapest possible price.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a separate interview with HirTV, Gulyas confirmed that Budapest will never support an embargo on Russian oil and gas.</p>
<p>The EU unveiled a plan in March to do away with Russian fossil fuels by 2030, but stopped short of an immediate ban, defying calls from Kiev to do so.</p>

<p>On Monday, Reuters quoted EU officials as saying that Brussels may exempt Hungary and Slovakia from the embargo on Russian oil, which is reportedly in the works. The newest sanctions package is expected to be finalized on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After the West froze Russian state assets in response to its military campaign in Ukraine, Moscow demanded that EU members switch to paying for Russian gas in rubles. Russia cut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria last week because they declined to pay in the Russian currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the move <em>&ldquo;unjustified and unacceptable.&rdquo;</em> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov argued on Monday that the demand to pay for gas in rubles is justified because the West had <em>&ldquo;stolen&rdquo;</em> Russian assets, the <em>&ldquo;majority of which had been earned through the supplies of gas and oil.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Western leaders are aware of the damage sanctions will inflict on their own economies, Germany admits</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The year 2022 will see Western countries implementing &ldquo;<em>a very ambitious policy</em>&rdquo; of reducing dependence on energy from Russia, with Russian oil set to be phased out by the end of the year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&nbsp;has announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with Indian Express ahead of his meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin, Scholz explained that &ldquo;<em>the attack on Ukraine by Russia is on the top of the agenda for all of Europe and beyond</em>.&rdquo; He also expressed confidence that there is &ldquo;<em>broad agreement</em>&rdquo; between Germany and India that Russia&rsquo;s actions violate the &ldquo;<em>core principles of the UN Charter</em>,&rdquo; that &ldquo;<em>massacres against the civilian population are war crimes</em>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<em>those responsible must be held accountable.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to what he called a &ldquo;<em>massive and unacceptable breach of international law</em>,&rdquo; Scholz explained that many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, &ldquo;<em>even if this necessarily implies economic costs</em>&rdquo; for themselves.</p>
<p>India is among a number of major economies that have continued to trade with Moscow&nbsp;since the launch of its&nbsp;military offensive in Ukraine.&nbsp;Last month, New Delhi hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who sought to sway officials&nbsp;towards taking part in the sanctions and scaling back economic and military ties with Moscow. However, India has so far refused to condemn Russia&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We are furthermore now implementing a very ambitious policy to reduce our dependency on the import of fossil fuels from Russia. We will stop the import of Russian coal this summer, we will phase out Russian oil [by] the end of the year, and will reduce gas imports from Russia severely</em>,&rdquo; the chancellor said.</p>

<p>Scholz has been known for taking a cautious approach on the matter of Russian energy, as Germany depends on it more than many other EU countries. The chancellor has said that a ban on Russian gas would not stop the conflict in Ukraine, but would cause an economic crisis in Germany and the EU.</p>
<p>However, as the EU discusses its sixth package of sanctions against Russia, Germany has apparently begun to lean towards taking more drastic measures, possibly because it has managed to significantly cut its own dependence on direct imports of Russian oil. Energy Minister Robert Habeck revealed last week that Berlin previously sourced a third of its requirements from Russia, but has now cut that to just 12%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The problem that seemed very large for Germany only a few weeks ago has become much smaller. Germany has come very, very close to independence from Russian oil imports,</em>&rdquo; Habeck said.</p>
<p>Russia supplied about 25% of the EU&rsquo;s total annual oil needs in 2020, and the bloc accounted for half of Russia&rsquo;s exports of the fuel. Brussels reportedly intends to make up the difference by increasing imports from Nigeria, the Persian Gulf exporters, as well as Russia&rsquo;s neighboring Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Moscow is apparently skeptical about Europe&rsquo;s chances of surviving without its energy. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is currently the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554391-gas-france-russia-assessment/">wrote</a>&nbsp;last month: &ldquo;<em>According to recent IMF data, Europe will be able to do without our gas for no more than 6 months. But speaking seriously, they won&rsquo;t even last a week.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In March, the Russian deputy prime minister and former energy minister, Alexander Novak, <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/552527-moscow-warns-europe-energy-crisis/">said</a> the ban on Russian oil and gas imports could result in a crash of Europe&rsquo;s energy market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is absolutely obvious that without Russian hydrocarbons, if sanctions are imposed, the gas and oil markets will collapse. The rise in prices for energy resources can be unpredictable</em>,&rdquo; Novak said.</p>
<p>Russia sent its troops to Ukraine in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>
<p>Western countries responded to Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>aggression</em>&rdquo; by imposing harsh sanctions on various sectors of the economy. Russia considers these actions unlawful and unjustified, and has been imposing its own counter-measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Improvements are planned for critical areas, senior official discloses</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Finland wants a stronger fence on its border with Russia, Colonel Marko Turunen, commander of the North Karelia Border Guard, told local media on Saturday. The news comes amid the standoff between Moscow and the West over Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Turunen explained to&nbsp;MTV3 that officials are analyzing the state of the border fence, but the final choice&nbsp;to reinforce it has not yet been made and no actual work has been done so far.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If such a decision is made, we will proceed in a controlled and planned manner,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;he outlined.</p>
<p>Russia and Finland share a 1,343km (834 mile) land border. According to MTV3, from the Finnish side, it is only protected <em>&ldquo;by a thin and rusty barbed wire fence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Turunen said a stronger barrier is planned for high-risk and critical areas, including border crossings and areas nearby. He declined to reveal the specifics on the estimated length of the planned reinforcement&nbsp;and its construction.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Krista Mikkonen told MTV3 that <em>&ldquo;Finland&rsquo;s capacity to maintain border security needs to be strengthened, and its crisis preparedness must be improved.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Riikka Purra, an MP and head of the right-wing Finns Party, backed the idea.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Construction is, of course, always expensive, but nothing is as valuable is our security,&rdquo;</em> she told the channel.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s attack on Ukraine in late February prompted discussions on whether Finland and Sweden should reconsider their longstanding policy of military nonalignment and join NATO. In a report submitted to the parliament last month, the Finnish government argued that joining the US-led bloc would <em>&ldquo;enhance the stability of the region in the long term,&rdquo;</em> but could also result in<em> &ldquo;increased tensions&rdquo;</em> along the border with Russia.</p>
<p>The Kremlin&nbsp;has repeatedly said that it sees the organisation's expansion eastward as a threat to national security. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy chairman of the country&rsquo;s Security Council, warned that Moscow will deploy additional troops on its western flank if Finland or Sweden join NATO.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>

                            <p><strong>Homeland Security chief says the task force is the exact opposite of George Orwell’s infamous brainchild</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The newly unveiled &lsquo;Disinformation Governance Board&rsquo;, operating within the US Department of Homeland Security, has triggered a massive pushback, forcing DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas to make several appearances on national TV in an attempt to clarify how the unit will operate.</p>
<p>Many critics, including top Republicans, have blasted the initiative as a crackdown on free speech, akin to a &lsquo;Ministry of Truth&rsquo; taken from the pages of George Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel &lsquo;1984&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking on CNN&rsquo;s State of the Union on Sunday, Mayorkas&nbsp;dismissed the criticism by claiming that thought policing is <em>&ldquo;precisely the opposite of what this small working group within the Department of Homeland Security will do.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What it will do is gather together best practices in addressing the threat of disinformation from foreign state adversaries from the cartels and disseminate those best practices to the operators that have been executing in addressing this threat for years,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/05/01/disinformation-governance-board-alejandro-mayorkas-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, after CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash said it was still not clear <em>&ldquo;how this governance board will act.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The DHS chief also repeatedly reassured Americans that the unit has absolutely no intention, <em>&ldquo;operational authority,&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;capability&rdquo;</em> to spy on US citizens.</p>

<p>The new body is headed by Nina Jankowicz, whose resume includes working with&nbsp;the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and overseeing the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute lobby group. Detractors also scrutinized her for dismissing the New York Post&rsquo;s suppressed Hunter Biden laptop story as a fake&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Russian influence op,&rdquo;</em> only for it to be later verified by major media outlets.</p>
<p>In a separate appearance on Fox News Sunday, Mayorkas <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-better-job-disinformation-board" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defended</a> the qualifications and objectivity of Jankowicz, calling her&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;eminently qualified&rdquo;</em> and a <em>&ldquo;renowned expert in the field of disinformation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I don&rsquo;t question her objectivity. There are people in the department who have a diverse range of views and they&rsquo;re incredibly dedicated to mission. We&rsquo;re not the opinion police.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki also attempted to play down the &lsquo;anti-disinformation&rsquo; initiative as an alleged&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;continuation of work that began at the Department of Homeland Security in 2020, under former President Trump.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Biden Administration’s creation of a “disinformation” bureau within DHS is effectively a Ministry of Truth that is alien to our constitutional tradition. <br><br>Florida rejects Biden’s attempt to enforce regime-approved narratives and to stifle dissent. <a href="https://t.co/fSnU2gk97x">pic.twitter.com/fSnU2gk97x</a></p>&mdash; Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1520068299417079808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>The new censorship push was announced on Wednesday, just two days after billionaire Elon Musk reached an agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion and vowed to restore freedom of speech on the platform.</p>
<p>Responding to news of Musk&rsquo;s Twitter takeover, Jankowicz said, <em>&ldquo;I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities, which are already shouldering disproportionate amounts of this abuse.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The world must arm itself against future health crises, the billionaire claims</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The World Health Organization is currently the only body that can create and manage a &ldquo;top-notch&rdquo; multi-domain team of health experts to detect, prevent and battle future pandemics, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said. The American billionaire is its top donor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With over 6.2 million people estimated to have died from, or with, Covid-19 over the course of the pandemic, it is possible that the world has yet to see the worst, Gates warned in an interview with the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8896c10-35da-46aa-957f-cf2b4e18cfce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> on Sunday, just days before his new book, &lsquo;How to Prevent the Next Pandemic&rsquo;, is set to hit the shelves.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still at risk of this pandemic generating a variant that would be even more transmissive and even more fatal,&rdquo;</em> Gates outlined. While saying he doesn&rsquo;t want to be&nbsp;the <em>&ldquo;voice of doom and gloom,&rdquo;</em> Gates estimated the risk that <em>&ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t even seen the worst&rdquo;</em> of the pandemic at&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;way above a 5 percent,&rdquo;</em> and emphasized the need to develop new longer-lasting vaccines.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;reiterated his call to establish a global emergency response team operating under GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization), with an annual budget of at least $1 billion. Gates said the amount of money needed for the initiative is<em> &ldquo;very small compared to the benefit,&rdquo;</em> and called it a test of world leaders&rsquo; ability to<em> &ldquo;take on new responsibilities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Last month, he gave a TED Talk in Vancouver to elaborate on the idea, also described in his book, saying he expects the group to consist of at least 3,000 doctors, epidemiologists, policy and communications experts, and diplomats operating under the direction of the WHO.</p>
<p>Gates&rsquo; book received praise from WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who fully agreed with his insistence that <em>&ldquo;we must act on Covid-19&rsquo;s lessons and innovate so that we can deliver swift, equitable health solutions to prevent the next pandemic.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>While Gates is not a certified medical expert and did not finish college, his massive wealth has allowed him to effectively dominate global health policy via the Gates Foundation as the largest private contributor to the global health body, behind only the US government in terms of funding.</p>
<p>Gates has become a common name in discussions about Covid-19 not only thanks to the millions his foundation has poured into the development and distribution of vaccines, but also because of another TED Talk from 2015, in which the tech mogul first warned that the world was unprepared for an <em>&ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;</em> global pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that his country would respond if a NATO member came under attack</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed on Sunday that NATO has &ldquo;no intention&rdquo; of intervening in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but vowed that his country would respond to any attack on a NATO ally. Throughout the conflict, Turkey has attempted to balance its relationship with both the US-led bloc and Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NATO's position is clear. The alliance has no intention of interfering in the Ukrainian conflict,"</em> Cavusoglu told reporters on Sunday after a trip to Latin America.</p>
<p>However, Turkey&rsquo;s top diplomat added that<em> "in the event of the slightest attack on any ally, we will respond adequately.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>NATO is not a direct participant in the Ukraine conflict, but its member states have shipped weapons and ammunition to Volodymyr Zelensky&rsquo;s government, the US has <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554643-us-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared intelligence</a> with Kiev, and Ukrainian troops are being <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554764-us-training-ukraine-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trained</a>&nbsp;at NATO bases in Europe.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused NATO of <em>&ldquo;essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy,&rdquo;</em> while Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554619-putin-strategic-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> outside players against intervening in the conflict last week, threatening to unleash a <em>&ldquo;swift, lightning-fast&rdquo;</em> response should Russia&rsquo;s security be put at risk.</p>

<p>Although a NATO member, Turkey fields some Russian weapons systems, and its insistence on purchasing the Russian-made S-400 air defense system saw it booted from the US&rsquo; F-35 jet fighter program in 2019.</p>
<p>Turkey has sought to maintain relations with both the bloc&nbsp;and Moscow since Russia&rsquo;s operation in Ukraine began in February. It has sold its domestically-produced Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, but has refused to impose sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Istanbul has hosted peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has offered to host talks between Putin and Zelensky.</p>
<p>Such talks have not yet materialized, and in an interview late last month with CNN Turk, Cavusoglu <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554248-turkey-ukraine-talks-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that <em>&ldquo;there are countries within NATO that want the war to continue,&rdquo;</em> in order to make Russia <em>&ldquo;weaker.&rdquo;</em> He did not, however, name any of those states.</p>
<p>The diplomat said that several South American leaders have offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, including Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who reportedly offered to visit Moscow for talks.</p>

<p><em>"Venezuela has good relations with Russia. Both Brazil and Venezuela have said that the war should be stopped,&rdquo;</em> Cavusoglu explained. <em>&ldquo;We said we would like to contribute to those efforts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Originally established as an anti-Bolshevik endeavor, RFE/RL has thrived as US-Russia relations have nose-dived</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The first of May&nbsp;marks the 51st anniversary of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (hereinafter &ldquo;RFE/RL&rdquo;, although this didn't become the official name until 1976) &ndash; radio stations which broadcast into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, respectively. As detailed in an internal CIA document from 1951 titled &ldquo;<a href="https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/114359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Aims and Objectives</a>,&rdquo; RFE/RL was to be operated by refugees or exiles from the various Socialist Bloc countries to broadcast information intended to encourage <em>&ldquo;hatred against the regime(s)&rdquo;</em> and to increase the <em>&ldquo;will to resist the regime(s).&rdquo;</em> In other words, this project had an explicit function to remove governments unfavorable to Washington.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, May 1 was chosen as the launch of this project&nbsp;as it coincided with International Workers&rsquo; Day, one of the most important holidays in the Socialist Bloc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From its inception until 1972, it was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the CIA which funded RFE/RL</a>,&nbsp;though it did so covertly without congressional knowledge or authorization. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And it was CIA Director Allen Dulles</a> &ndash; <a href="https://www.wbur.org/npr/234752747/meet-the-brothers-who-shaped-u-s-policy-inside-and-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the mastermind behind the overthrow</a> of democratic governments in countries such as Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954) &ndash; who greenlit the secret financing of RFE/RL in the hope that it would contribute to the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Ironically, even as the CIA was backing this project, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was helping to restore fascist</a>, military rule to Greece &ndash; which it preferred to a Greek communist government. The left-wingers had great political stature among the electorate because of their valiant fight against the Nazis.</p>
<p>The memories of this betrayal by the West in Greece were awakened recently when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared by video before the Greek parliament <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/04/08/progressives-in-greece-reject-zelenskys-address-to-parliament-with-neo-nazis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alongside a neo-Nazi Azov fighter</a>, causing some of the members&nbsp;to get up and leave in protest.</p>
<p>The US and its CIA <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/35_countries_the_u_s_has_backed_international_crime_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made similar choices</a> in countries&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Indonesia, and later Chile and Argentina, opting to support ultra-right-wing dictatorships in lieu of socialist, albeit democratic, governments. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43134017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cord Meyer</a>, who took charge of the CIA&rsquo;s relationship with Radio Liberty in 1954 and led these operations for many years, <em>&ldquo;[t]he CIA maintained control over [radio] content by formulating general policy guidelines, which were supplemented by daily meetings to determine the handling of specific news.&rdquo;</em> Meyer insists, however, that this control did not interfere with the journalistic integrity of the radio programs.</p>
<p>In addition, while Meyer insists that there were no actual spies operating within the radio stations, the radio personnel nevertheless kept detailed accounts of what they observed in the various countries in which they operated; in other words, they did provide intelligence for the CIA. And even after Congress ended CIA funding of RFE/RL&nbsp;in 1972 &ndash; the money&nbsp;would come <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly from Congress</a> from then on &ndash; its primary purpose remained to broadcast anti-communist programs into the East Bloc, at least until the communist governments in Eastern Europe and then the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
<p>Of course, RFE/RL&nbsp;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openly takes credit</a> for helping to bring about this ultimate collapse, believing that its influence whittled away at the support of the various communist governments. It&nbsp;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has found support for this claim</a> from the likes of Vaclav Havel (who invited RFE/RL&nbsp;to move from its original headquarters in Munich, Germany to Prague after the collapse of the East Bloc) and Boris Yeltsin.</p>

<p>I recall quite vividly, as someone who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, the incessant complaints that the Soviet Union would often jam the signals of Radio Liberty &ndash; evidence, we were told, that Moscow&nbsp;simply could not handle the truth. I think of this now as the outlet I am writing this article for &ndash; RT, of course a Russian-based news outlet &ndash; <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rt-sputnik-youtube-banned-europe-1235101699/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is being suppressed</a> in the US <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or outrightly banned in the EU</a>.</p>
<p>You may ask what this says about the EU and the US today.</p>
<p>RFE/RL&nbsp;would seem to be a relic of the bygone era of the Cold War when the US and the Soviet Union were vying for the hearts and minds of the world. Not only is the Cold War over, but it seems that most mainstream outlets &ndash; such as Fox, CNN and MSNBC &ndash; serve the same role as RFE/RL&nbsp;itself. And yet, RFE/RL&nbsp;continues to exist to this day, and indeed has received new life during the current crisis in Ukraine &ndash; a flashpoint&nbsp;which some observe as <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/new-cold-war-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the beginning of a new Cold War</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the fact that RFE/RL has broadcast continuously, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it begs the question of whether the first Cold War ever actually ended in the first place. Certainly, <a href="https://fpif.org/cold-war-never-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some observers</a>, myself included, believe that the stand-off&nbsp;didn't come to a conclusion, and we strain to understand why. I agree with John Feffer, <a href="https://fpif.org/cold-war-never-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing in <em>Foreign Policy in Focus</em></a>, who opined:</p>
<p>The Cold War, then, was not just about a confrontation between ideological foes. The Soviet Union dropped out of that competition and Russia under Putin continues to remain focused on concerns along its borders, unlike the USSR which sought global hegemony. The US, on the other hand, has not changed its attitude. And that, ultimately, is why the Cold War never died.</p>

<p>If Washington had disbanded NATO, pushed for nuclear disarmament, and helped to create a new security architecture for Europe that included Russia, the Cold War would have died a natural death. Instead, because the institutions of the Cold War lived on, the spirit of the enterprise lay dormant, only waiting for the opportunity to spring forth.</p>
<p>Of course, RFE/RL is one of the other <em>&ldquo;institutions of the Cold War [which] lived on,&rdquo;</em> arguably perpetuating the old Cold War antagonisms. For its part, <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the state-run outlet has justified</a> its continued existence as follows: <em>&ldquo;With the collapse of communism, some thought RFE/RL had fulfilled its mission and could be disbanded. But officials throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, many of them former dissidents, saw a continuing need for precisely the kind of objective broadcasts that RFE/RL provided, especially during democratic transition.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-radio-free-europe/radio-liberty-sets-out-to-break-russian-propaganda-wall/articleshow/89197613.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Economic Times explains</a>, <em>&ldquo;[b]ased in Prague, RFE/RL was founded in 1950 as an anti-communist outlet to beam programs into the Soviet bloc, helping topple those totalitarian regimes nearly four decades later. These days, it still broadcasts in 27 languages &ndash; including Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian &ndash; to 23 countries, many where media freedoms face severe restrictions.&rdquo;</em> As related in the same article, <em>&ldquo;RFE/RL, which has a target audience of 37 million people, stepped up activities in the region following Russia&rsquo;s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the occupation of eastern Ukraine by pro-Moscow rebel forces.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>With apparently no sense of irony, the <em>Economic Times</em>, in trumpeting the work of RFE/RL,<em> </em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-radio-free-europe/radio-liberty-sets-out-to-break-russian-propaganda-wall/articleshow/89197613.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">states that</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Russia very quickly understood that it is not necessary to lie to make successful propaganda. All you need is to withhold context and create white noise.&rdquo;</em> Of course, the US and Western media have realized the very same, with the situation in Ukraine being a case in point. Thus, much of the current Ukraine coverage in the West would lead the audience to believe that the crisis started suddenly in February of this year with the Russian offensive, while in fact <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/conflict-ukraines-donbas-visual-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there has been a conflict</a> between the government in Kiev and the Russian-speaking population of the Donbas for the past eight years, claiming 14,000 lives. This missing context is indeed quite misleading for the casual news consumer. Moreover, referring to the Russian speakers in the eastern part of Ukraine as &ldquo;pro-Moscow,&rdquo; as the <em>Economic Times</em> and nearly every other Western news outlet does, fails to capture the very real grievances of these people who have been militarily attacked by their own government for years &ndash; whether they are pro-Moscow or not is not really the critical issue here. But, I suppose, one person&rsquo;s propaganda is another person&rsquo;s news, and vice versa.</p>

<p>After the collapse of communism, RFE/RL&nbsp;followed wherever US foreign policy aims were focused. Thus, as <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it explains itself</a>, it started broadcasting in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s as the US and NATO began meddling there, and expanded beyond Europe in the late 1990s to Iraq and Iran <em>&ldquo;[r]eflecting American attention to the greater Middle East&hellip;&rdquo;</em> Also, in 2002, RFE/RL started broadcasting in Afghanistan again &ndash; it had initially done so in the 1980s during the Soviet occupation but discontinued broadcasting thereafter.</p>
<p>However, the state-controlled outlet&nbsp;has never lost its focus on Russia and Eastern Europe. Thus, in addition to increasing its reach&nbsp;in Ukraine, RFE/RL&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;<a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanded</a> on&hellip; local news efforts between 2016 and 2019 by creating websites serving the needs of audiences in the&nbsp;North Caucasus,&nbsp;Middle Volga,&nbsp;Siberian, and&nbsp;Northwestern&nbsp;regions of Russia.&rdquo;</em> Beginning in 2019, RFE/RL, after leaving for a time after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, began to return to Romania, Bulgaria and later Hungary, <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/ecc79546280f27a0/Documents/a%20reversal%20in%20democratic%20gains%20and%20attacks%20on%20the%20rule%20of%20law%20and%20the%20judiciary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming</a> that it was needed <em>&ldquo;in light of a reversal in democratic gains and attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary&rdquo;</em> in those countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Cold War raging again between the US and Russia &ndash; whether it's viewed as new or simply a continuation of the old confrontation &ndash; RFE/RL&nbsp;will certainly have a <em>raison d&rsquo;etre </em>for some time to come, and its congressional funding (it's parent body, the US&nbsp;Agency for Global Media, received over $810 million in 2020) certainly be secured. While there can be disagreement over whether RFE/RL&nbsp;continues to be necessary after the end of communism, or whether it in fact can be seen as unnecessarily stoking old Cold War tensions, the one thing that can be said of RFE/RL is that it does not, and really cannot, hide what it is. That is, it is quite transparently a US-funded news source which broadcasts programing reflecting the foreign policy interests and views of the United States. <a href="https://pressroom.rferl.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It says so</a> on its own website.</p>
<p>Indeed, its aforementioned parent proudly boasts that it must be "<em>consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States</em>" and is obliged to have "<em>the capability to provide a surge capacity to support United States foreign policy objectives during crises abroad</em>." Again, no secret is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usagm.gov/who-we-are/oversight/legislation/standards-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made of this.</a></p>
<p>To be fair, this, in my view, makes RFE/RL&nbsp;less nefarious than other institutions &ndash; such as private broadcast news or even Hollywood movies which we know <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/operation-tinseltown-how-the-cia-manipulates-hollywood/491138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are heavily influenced by the CIA</a> &ndash; which claim to be objective arbiters of the truth and reality, but which really are not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that RFE/RL&nbsp;is lying, but it is certainly giving a slanted view of the world. But again, because this is quite obvious, the audience can at least make an intelligent judgment about the accuracy of what they are being told. Many times, that&rsquo;s the best we can ask for.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Adam Kinzinger’s resolution would allow President Biden to deploy American forces if Russia uses weapons of mass destruction</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, announced on Sunday that he will introduce a resolution authorizing the use of military force should Russia deploy <em>&ldquo;chemical, biological and/or nuclear weapons&rdquo;</em> in Ukraine. Kinzinger has continuously pushed for US involvement in the ongoing conflict, and previously backed measures that critics and President Biden said would lead to a <em>&ldquo;third world war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kinzinger&rsquo;s <a href="https://kinzinger.house.gov/uploadedfiles/kinzinger_aumf2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resolution</a> would authorize the president to use the American military to <em>&ldquo;assist in defending and restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> in response to a hypothetical Russian use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil.</p>
<p>The resolution would give the president sole authority to determine whether such aggression by Russia had actually taken place, without requiring any international investigation. Accordingly, it could incentivize Ukrainian forces to <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554487-white-helmets-instructors-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stage such an attack</a> in the hopes of drawing the US into the conflict, as commanders in Moscow have accused Kiev of planning.</p>
<p>As an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, the resolution would function like the post-9/11 AUMF that has been renewed every year since 2001. This authorization has given US presidents legal clearance to attack more than a dozen countries since 9/11, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen, without a formal declaration of war.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;As the President of the United States has said, Putin must be stopped,&rdquo;</em> read a statement from Kinzinger&rsquo;s office. <em>&ldquo;Accordingly, the Commander in Chief to the world&rsquo;s greatest military should have the authority and means to take the necessary actions to do so.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Kinzinger, a Republican who aligns with Democrats on most issues, has publicly called for US involvement in the conflict already. Within a day of Russian forces entering Ukraine in February, Kinzinger was <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1497354030904975364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanding</a> that NATO enforce a &lsquo;no-fly zone&rsquo; over the country, a move that would see the US-led military alliance commit to shooting down Russian aircraft and striking Russian air defense systems.</p>
<p>While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also requested such a move, Biden has refused, saying that it would trigger a <em>&ldquo;third world war&rdquo;</em> with Russia. Kinzinger has also <a href="https://twitter.com/adamkinzinger/status/1501674992861204482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pressured</a> the Biden administration to send fighter jets donated by Poland into Ukraine, which the administration has refused. Citing the risks involved in having US pilots deliver warplanes into an active conflict zone, Biden again said that he wished to avoid <em>&ldquo;World War III.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is currently unclear if and when Kinzinger&rsquo;s resolution will be brought to a vote. Biden himself has said that the US &ldquo;<em>would respond</em>&rdquo; to any use of weapons of mass destruction by Russian forces in Ukraine, but has avoided drawing any binding &lsquo;red lines&rsquo;. Instead, the US has continued to ship weapons to Ukraine and is currently <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554764-us-training-ukraine-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training</a> Ukrainian soldiers on some of these weapons systems in Germany.</p>

<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

                            <p><strong>The key ‘building blocks’ of DNA and RNA have been discovered on asteroids, scientists confirm</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A hypothesis suggesting that the seeds of life could have been literally brought to Earth from space has received a boost from a study published earlier this week that showed that all five key <em>&ldquo;ingredients&rdquo;</em> needed to form DNA can be found on asteroids. A group of scientists has discovered the final two pieces of the DNA puzzle that had previously not been observed in any meteorite samples, according to a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29612-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> this week in the peer-reviewed Nature Communications journal.</p>
<p>DNA and RNA, which form the genetic basis of all known living beings on Earth, consist of five key informational components called nucleobases. Until now, scientists had been able to find three out of the five in various meteorite samples, showing that they could have been brought to Earth from space.</p>

<p>Now, a team led by Associate Professor Yasuhiro Oba of Hokkaido University in Japan, managed to identify the remaining two components that had eluded researchers. The team, which consists of scientists from the US and Japan, has studied three carbonaceous meteorites that fell in Australia, the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The newly discovered nucleobases &ndash; cytosine and thymine &ndash; may have previously escaped scientists&rsquo; attention due to their particularly delicate structure, meaning they could have been degraded due to the nature of previous experiments, the US space agency NASA, which also contributed to the research, suggested.</p>
<p>Previous experiments involved placing meteorite samples into hot liquids and analyzing the resulting solution. However, Oda&rsquo;s team used another method that <em>&ldquo;is more like cold brew than hot tea and is able to pull out more delicate compounds,&rdquo;</em> said Jason Dworkin, a co-author of the paper at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We now have evidence that the complete set of nucleobases used in life today could have been available on Earth when life emerged,&rdquo;</em> Danny Glavin, another researcher at the Goddard center, has said.</p>

<p>Modern evolutionary biology suggests that chemical elements combined to eventually form different, competing sequences of nucleic acid, a precursor to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). However, the exact mechanism by which our planet was seeded with the original building blocks needed for life to emerge is still unclear.</p>
<p>Nor does the discovery mean that life was necessarily brought to Earth from space. Another hypothesis suggests that life came about in a <em>&ldquo;prebiotic soup&rdquo;</em> on the planet&rsquo;s surface during the Earth&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;infancy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If the production efficiency of nucleobases on the Earth was much higher than the inputs from space&hellip; contributions to the emergence of genetic function and/or life itself from such extraterrestrial nucleobases could not be large,&rdquo;</em> Oba, the leading researcher behind the study, has said.</p>
<p>Nucleobases are not living organisms themselves, but rather organic chemical compounds seen as &lsquo;precursors&rsquo; to life in the form of DNA. Any of these compounds can emerge as the result of chemical reactions taking place on asteroids travelling through space, as the latest study has shown.</p>

<p>However, the discovery does give scientists a broader understanding of the complex chemical processes happening in the universe.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is adding more and more pieces; meteorites have been found to have sugars and bases now,&rdquo;</em> Dworkin has said. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to see progress in the making of the fundamental molecules of biology from space,&rdquo;</em> he has added.</p>
<p>Yet, now the scientists also face some new questions about the life &lsquo;precursors&rsquo;. The nucleobases, which are also known as &lsquo;purines and pyrimidines&rsquo;, depending on their structure, appear to be surprisingly uniform despite the numerous places of their origin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I wonder why purines and pyrimidines are exceptional in that they do not show structural diversity in carbonaceous meteorites unlike other classes of organic compounds such as amino acids and hydrocarbons,&rdquo;</em> Oba has said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Since purines and pyrimidines can be synthesized in extraterrestrial environments, as has been demonstrated by our own study, one would expect to find a wide diversity of these organic molecules in meteorites,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Black-clad anarchists clashed with police and smashed storefronts as France’s annual day of left-wing protest turned violent</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Thousands of protesters packed the streets of Paris on Sunday to mark May Day, an annual day of demonstration by socialists and trade unions. With masked &lsquo;black bloc&rsquo; anarchists among the crowd, violence and vandalism soon followed.</p>
<p>At least 5,000 police officers were deployed to the streets of the French capital, backed up by armored cars and water cannons. This year&rsquo;s protests came a week after French President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected, and with around 250 demonstrations planned in the city alone, trade union boss Philippe Martinez called on citizens to <em>&ldquo;take to the streets&rdquo;</em> and make the protests <em>&ldquo;as massive as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Leftist leader Jean-Luc Melenchon called on his followers to oppose Macron&rsquo;s planned pension reforms, and marchers held banners decrying the centrist president&rsquo;s plans to raise the retirement age to 65.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid crowds of peaceful marchers, groups dressed in black and wearing masks soon scuffled with police. Tear gas was fired and video footage showed officers tackling suspects to the ground, while another clip showed a group of heavily-armored officers charging protesters who pelted them with projectiles.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The US president called journalists “the only group of Americans who have a lower approval rating than I have”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>President Joe Biden made fun of his own approval ratings, roasted Donald Trump, and took a gentle ribbing from comedian Trevor Noah at the White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association Dinner on Saturday night. The dinner was shunned by Trump and canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited to be here with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have,&rdquo;</em> Biden joked to the Washington, DC crowd,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554413-kamala-harris-approval-ratings-worst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">referring</a> to his own sub-40% polling and to&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a> showing just 36% of Americans trust the mass media.</p>
<p>United in unpopularity, Biden and the press poked fun at each other throughout the night. Biden jibed at Fox News reporters for all being <em>&ldquo;vaccinated and boosted,&rdquo;</em> despite many of the network&rsquo;s conservative viewers refusing the Covid-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comedian Trevor Noah, hosting the event, mocked the president for his handling of the economy quipping <em>&ldquo;You know, I think ever since you&rsquo;ve come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything,&rdquo;</em> and roasted MSNBC for its pro-Biden coverage.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the way, MSNBC, can I just say you guys are doing great work,&rdquo;</em> Noah said. <em>&ldquo;You know when Trump was in office, your shows were all about how bad he was. And now that Biden&rsquo;s in office, your shows are all about how bad Trump was. Consistency is important.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Biden fired off more self-deprecating material, remarking that <em>&ldquo;Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He&rsquo;s having a really good year. I&rsquo;m kind of happy for him,&rdquo;</em> a reference to the phrase &lsquo;<a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/543850-nascar-brandon-brown-biden-chant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let&rsquo;s go Brandon</a>&rsquo;, which has become a popular chant among Biden&rsquo;s conservative opponents.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">President Biden: &quot;Republican seem to be supporting one fella. His name is BRANDON. He must be having a great year!&quot; <a href="https://t.co/wmbQmThQ8r">pic.twitter.com/wmbQmThQ8r</a></p>&mdash; Ray [REDACTED] (@RayRedacted) <a href="https://twitter.com/RayRedacted/status/1520589705926041602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>However, in a room full of Democrats and liberal journalists and guests, Trump and the Republican Party provided Biden and Noah with much of their material.</p>
<p>Noah compared Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to the <em>&ldquo;terminator,&rdquo;</em> hammering him for banning math textbooks so that <em>&ldquo;nobody knows how to count the votes.&rdquo;</em> DeSantis &ndash; whose state recently rejected 41% of math textbooks used in the state due to references to &lsquo;Critical Race Theory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Social Emotional Learning&rsquo; &ndash; was also indirectly mocked by Biden for trying to <em>&ldquo;Tear down Mickey Mouse&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</em> This quip referred to DeSantis&rsquo; efforts to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554379-florida-disney-status-revoked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strip</a> Walt Disney World of its self-governance rights over Disney&rsquo;s opposition to a law forbidding teachers from discussing sexuality and gender identity with elementary school children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In explaining the absence of the Correspondents&rsquo; Association Dinner for the last six years, Biden sniped <em>&ldquo;we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of Covid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year,&rdquo;</em> he continued. <em>&ldquo;Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred!&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Biden: It’s the first time a president attended this dinner in six years. It’s understandable. We had a horrible plague followed by two years of Covid <a href="https://t.co/0U9ln8ZMLw">pic.twitter.com/0U9ln8ZMLw</a></p>&mdash; Acyn (@Acyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1520589558877802497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>As the event closed, Noah made one final dig at Biden over his administration&rsquo;s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Please be careful leaving tonight,&rdquo;</em> he told the crowd. <em>&ldquo;This administration doesn&rsquo;t handle evacuations well.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Olaf Scholz says he won’t let polls and surveys determine “questions of war and peace”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that Berlin won&rsquo;t take the lead in sending heavy weapons and vehicles to Ukraine. Pressed to do so by officials in Kiev and from within his own government, Scholz insisted that he won&rsquo;t take any <em>&ldquo;hasty action&rdquo;</em> that could broaden the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I make my decisions quickly and coordinate them with our allies,&rdquo;</em> Scholz told tabloid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-inland/kanzler-olaf-scholz-in-japan-deutsche-alleingaenge-sind-mir-suspekt-79934148.bild.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bild am Sonntag</a> in an interview published on Sunday. <em>&ldquo;I am suspicious of hasty action and German solo efforts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The newspaper noted that Scholz&rsquo;s phrasing indicates that as long as the United States and Germany&rsquo;s other major allies are not sending Western-made battle tanks to Ukraine, Germany will not stand out and send such armaments to President Volodymyr Zelensky&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>However, Scholz, a Social Democrat in office since December, has drawn intense criticism for not taking such a stand. Zelensky himself has asked Berlin to send armored vehicles and accused the German government of <em>&ldquo;earning [its] money in other people&rsquo;s blood&rdquo;</em> by continuing to buy Russian oil and gas. Meanwhile at home, Scholz&rsquo;s approval ratings have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554208-olaf-scholz-popularity-record-low/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sunk</a>, and members of his own government have publicly stated that Ukraine should be armed by the West, with no <em>&ldquo;excuses.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;You should take note of surveys, but you must not make your actions dependent on them, especially in questions of war and peace that would be extremely dangerous,&rdquo;</em> Scholz told Bild am Sonntag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chancellor has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554356-germany-russia-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insisted</a> that he doesn&rsquo;t think it is <em>&ldquo;justified for Germany and NATO to become warring parties in Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> and that Germany <em>&ldquo;must do everything possible to avoid a direct military confrontation between NATO and a highly armed superpower like Russia.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Scholz has already broken with decades of conflict-averse foreign policy by sending thousands of anti-tank and surface-to-air weapons to Ukraine and hiking military spending. In a further step toward participation in the conflict, the German government gave the green light last week to the delivery of dozens of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554530-germany-supply-ukraine-weaponry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gepard</a> self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Kiev. In addition, Germany&rsquo;s Rheinmetall arms manufacturer is currently awaiting Scholz&rsquo;s approval to sell 88 decommissioned Leopard infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As much as Scholz has been criticized for his inaction, he has also come under fire for his actions. A group of prominent German politicians and public figures sent the government an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554384-german-politicians-stop-aid-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter</a> earlier this month urging Berlin to cease all weapons shipments to avoid prolonging a bloody conflict that Ukraine <em>&ldquo;has little chance of winning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554739-berlin-letter-stop-weapons-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a>&nbsp;published in a feminist magazine on Friday and signed by dozens of German cultural figures called on Scholz to <em>&ldquo;remember [his] initial position&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;not supply any more heavy weapons to Ukraine, either directly or indirectly.&rdquo;</em> Instead, they wrote, Berlin should<em> &ldquo;do everything&rdquo;</em> it can to broker a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Russia attacked its neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Polish military claims that the exercises have nothing to do with the situation in the region</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Poland is participating in two large-scale multinational drills and is the host nation for one of them, the country&rsquo;s Defense Ministry revealed on Sunday amid Russian allegations that Warsaw is preparing to occupy the western part of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Defender Europe 2022 (DE22) and Swift Response 2022 (SR22) will be conducted in nine countries including Poland between May 1-27, the Polish ministry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>There will be approximately 18,000 participants from over 20 countries training together in both exercises. The portion of the exercises on Polish soil will see some 7,000 troops and 3,000 pieces of equipment</em>,&rdquo; the statement reads.</p>
<p>Defender Europe is a regularly conducted American-led multinational exercise that aims poised to &ldquo;<em>build preparedness and interoperability between Allies and partners&rdquo;</em> of NATO and America. DE22 training will be conducted at several sites in Poland, with Polish soldiers to be joined by personnel from the US, France, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and UK.</p>

<p>The Swift Response exercise will entail approximately 550 Polish soldiers being deployed to Lithuania and Latvia along with troops from the Czech Republic and a German-Dutch force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Joint combined exercises such as these enhance the security of the NATO Eastern Flank through a training in accordance with NATO standards and procedures</em>,&rdquo; the Defense Ministry emphasized.</p>
<p>It added that the drills also contribute to the bloc's preparedness &ldquo;<em>to meet new and emerging challenges at the contemporary battlefield in order to deter a potential aggressor.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The military specifically pointed out that DE22 and SR 22 &ldquo;<em>are not aimed against any country and are not related to the current geopolitical situation in the region,</em>&rdquo; in a veiled reference to the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine.</p>
<p>These assurances come as Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin accused Warsaw of preparing to occupy the western part of Ukraine, which Poland considers as &ldquo;<em>historically belonging</em>&rdquo; to it. The potential &ldquo;<em>reunification</em>&rdquo; of Poland with western Ukraine will come under the guise of deploying a &ldquo;<em>peacekeeping</em>&rdquo; mission into the country under the pretext of protecting Kiev from &ldquo;<em>Russian aggression</em>,&rdquo; the official alleged. Warsaw denied the claims.</p>
<p>For years, Russia has expressed concern over NATO&rsquo;s expansion eastwards, which it considers a direct threat to its own security. This factor along with the possibility of Ukraine eventually joining the alliance were named by Moscow as the key reasons for launch of its military offensive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Tokyo may make parts of its defense guidelines secret in the wake of China, Russia “threats,” Kyodo News says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Japan is considering partially classifying its chief defense document in the wake of &ldquo;security threats by China and Russia,&rdquo; Kyodo News reported on Saturday, citing government sources.</p>
<p>Making the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), the country&rsquo;s 10-year military buildup policy, secret would be in line with the mostly classified US National Defense Strategy and would allow Tokyo to be <em>&ldquo;more specific&rdquo;</em> in making contingency plans involving North Korea, the sources told the Japanese news agency. The government in Tokyo will review the current defense guidelines, which are publicly available, by the end of the year, focusing on whether Japan can acquire weapons to launch counterstrikes on enemy bases, Kyodo News wrote.</p>
<p>The matter is a sensitive issue, given Japan&rsquo;s defense-oriented constitution that explicitly renounces war.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Having a document similar to the [US] National Defense Strategy is requisite,&rdquo;</em> a lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the LDP proposed revising Japan&rsquo;s most important defense and diplomacy documents amid what it described as an <em>&ldquo;increasingly severe&rdquo;</em> security environment. The lawmakers specifically urged the government to develop <em>&ldquo;counterstrike capabilities&rdquo;</em> and consider roughly doubling the defense budget to 2% or more of GDP, Japanese media said.</p>
<p>According to the Japan Times, the party cited Russia&rsquo;s military campaign in Ukraine, North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile programs, and China&rsquo;s military activities near Taiwan.</p>
<p>The LDP also wants to update the National Security Strategy and the medium-term five-year military buildup program. The proposals have been submitted to the country&rsquo;s defense minister and prime minister.</p>
<p>In December, Japan approved a hike in military spending, with the defense budget for the fiscal year 2022 totaling 5.4 trillion yen ($47.2 billion).</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US will be there for Ukraine until the fight with Russia is “done,” the House speaker vowed</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has paid a surprise visit to Kiev to personally reassure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of Washington&rsquo;s support amid the conflict with Russia, it was revealed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Zelensky shared a video on Twitter in which he is seen greeting Pelosi and other US lawmakers outside the presidential palace in the Ukrainian capital.</p>
<p>The highest-ranking US official to come to Kiev since the start of the fighting, Pelosi was accompanied by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern and Rep. Jason Crow. The House speaker is formally second in line to the presidency after the vice president.</p>

<p>The sides then held brief talks, during which Zelensky reiterated the need for continued US military support.</p>
<p>Pelosi told the Ukrainian leader that the US lawmakers were visiting Kiev <em>&ldquo;to say thank you for your fight for freedom.&rdquo;</em><br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Your fight is a fight for everyone. Our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done,&rdquo;</em> she promised.</p>
<p>Zelensky also used the opportunity to award Pelosi with the Order of Princess Olga, the third grade, a Ukrainian civil decoration bestowed upon women for personal merits in politics, science, culture and humanitarian areas.</p>

<p>The House speaker&rsquo;s office said in a statement that getting together with the Ukrainian president was <em>&ldquo;an extraordinary honor.&rdquo;</em> The trip was aimed at sending <em>&ldquo;an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire world: America stands firmly with Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> the statement read.</p>
<p>The US delegation subsequently headed to Ukraine&rsquo;s neighbor and ally Poland for talks with the country&rsquo;s president, Andrzej Duda, and other top officials.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin were in Kiev a week ago with a visit having a similar aim of providing reassurance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Following the trip, Austin openly acknowledged that, by helping the Ukrainian government, the US was trying to see <em>&ldquo;Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Washington has committed $4.3 billion to Kiev in military support since 2021, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday, also revealing that the US had begun training Ukrainian troops in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Zelensky has received several high-profile officials in Kiev during the conflict, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and leaders of other European nations.</p>
<p>Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, following Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

                            <p><strong>American and British officials held their first meeting on the issue in early March, the media has learned</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>High-ranking US and UK officials held secret talks in early March to discuss greater British involvement on the issue of Taiwan, according to a report by the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The negotiations involved Kurt Campbell, the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator, and Laura Rosenberger, the top US National Security Council China official, and took place amid a broader two-day meeting on Indo-Pacific strategy between the sides, sources told the paper.</p>
<p>Campbell and Rosenberger addressed a range of issues from the possibility of London intensifying diplomatic contacts with Taipei to boosting so-called deterrence in Asia, one unnamed official revealed. The role that the UK would play if tensions over Taiwan lead to war between the US and China was also on the agenda, he added.</p>
<p>A UK official who talked to the paper said this was the <em>&ldquo;highest-level&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;most significant&rdquo;</em> bilateral discussion over Taiwan to date.<em> &ldquo;Naturally, crisis planning would be a hefty chunk of any such conversation about Taiwan,&rdquo;</em> he noted.</p>

<p>According to FT, the US is not seeking greater engagement from the UK because Taiwan is under imminent threat &ndash; the talks were part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to boost cooperation with America&rsquo;s European allies on the issue.</p>
<p>Washington is now sharing intelligence on Taiwan that was previously classified as &lsquo;NOFORN&rsquo; (which stands for &lsquo;no foreign nationals&rsquo;, meaning: not to be shown to foreign officials) with some of its allies, the sources said.</p>
<p>A senior Taiwanese official confirmed that Taipei has been aware of Washington&rsquo;s efforts to involve more countries in its Taiwan planning. <em>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been doing it with Japan and Australia, and now they&rsquo;re trying to do it with Britain,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Both the White House and Downing Street declined to comment when approached by FT about the meeting.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, but never formally declared independence from China. Beijing views the island of 23.5 million as a breakaway territory, under its One-China policy.</p>

<p>China is advocating for peaceful <em>&lsquo;reunification&rsquo;</em> with Taiwan, but has not ruled out the use of force. Patrols and military drills around the island by the Chinese military have significantly intensified over the past year.</p>
<p>Washington maintains strong ties with Taipei, backing its push for sovereignty, while supplying arms to the island.</p>
<p>Beijing has expressed anger over these moves, calling them provocations and meddling in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>Several American officials claim that China has been closely monitoring the Russian military operation in Ukraine, learning lessons for a potential campaign against Taiwan.</p>
<p>Despite pressure from Washington, Beijing has been reluctant to condemn Moscow for its offensive&nbsp;in the neighboring country launched in late February, or to take part in the international sanctions against Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Annalena Baerbock was called a “warmonger” by protesters</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A group of protesters heckled German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a speech on Saturday, as she defended the government&rsquo;s decision to send weapons to Ukraine. Many Western states have supplied Kiev with arms since Russia attacked the neighboring country, in February.</p>
<p>Around 1,000 people gathered to hear Baerbock speak in the northern German town of Ahrensburg. At the same time, roughly 150 attendees booed the minister and used whistles, sirens, and loudspeakers when she was on stage, police said. Some shouted <em>&ldquo;warmonger&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;liar&rdquo;</em> at Baerbock.</p>
<p>Police said the situation calmed down after officers intervened. One person was banned from the event.</p>
<p>Baerbock, who arrived in Ahrensburg to campaign for the Green Party in the regional elections, defended the decision to send weapons to Ukraine amid the Russian offensive. <em>&ldquo;We want to help the people of Ukraine so they can defend themselves against Putin&rsquo;s war of aggression, which is illegal under international law,&rdquo;</em> she told the crowd, referring to the Russian president.</p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>Baerbock also planned a campaign event in Lubeck, another city in northern Germany, on Saturday. But the speech was canceled due to security concerns after someone sprayed butyric acid on an open-air stage. The acid has an acrid smell, and can cause eye irritation and breathing problems. No one was injured in the incident.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will not be intimidated by such cowardly, underhanded attacks,&rdquo;</em> Emily Buning, the Greens&rsquo; political director, said.</p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz was similarly heckled this month during a campaign speech in Essen, western Germany.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the nation&rsquo;s parliament approved delivery of heavier weapons to Ukraine. Along with many other NATO members, Germany has been supplying Kiev with arms, including anti-armor and anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The British Virgin Islands’ acting premier says “draconian measures” would undermine the “historical constitutional progress”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The acting premier of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has expressed deep concerns over London&rsquo;s plans to assume direct governance of the Caribbean territory, following the arrest of its leader in a US drug sting operation and a highly-critical report into alleged systemic corruption.</p>
<p>On Friday, shortly before the premier of the BVI, Andrew Fahie, appeared before a US judge on charges of cocaine smuggling and money laundering, a commission of inquiry led by Judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom hurriedly published its <a href="https://bvi.gov.vg/content/coi-report">final report</a>, urging the UK to dissolve the islands&rsquo; elected government, suspend their constitution, and impose direct rule for at least two years.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What this would mean in real terms is that there would no longer be elected representatives who represent the people of the districts and the territory in the house of assembly where laws are made for our society,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>Natalio Wheatley, who assumed the post of acting premier after Fahie&rsquo;s arrest,&nbsp;<a href="https://bvi.gov.vg/media-centre/statement-acting-premier-wheatley-commission-inquiry-report-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p>

<p>London dispatched a Foreign Office minister, Amanda Milling, to meet the territory&rsquo;s governor, James Rankin, and other senior figures and discuss the terms of direct rule, ahead of a formal decision expected next week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The acting premier acknowledged <em>&ldquo;very serious matters highlighted in the report, which spanned successive Administrations,&rdquo;</em> and did not question the British Crown representative&rsquo;s authority and responsibility to maintain order &ndash; but said the proposed reforms <em>&ldquo;can be achieved without the partial or full suspension of the constitution,&rdquo;</em> under already existing emergency powers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I urge you the public to read the report with an objective eye in terms of strengthening our systems of Government under a democratic framework of governance, as opposed to draconian measures that would set back the historical constitutional progress we have made as a people.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hickinbottom&rsquo;s commission was established in 2021, amid claims of corruption and wasteful government spending, as well as rumors that the island&rsquo;s leadership was engaging in drug trafficking. According to The Guardian, the British government was aware of the US undercover investigation, and decided to <em>&ldquo;rush out&rdquo;</em> the 1,000-page Hickinbottom report after Fahie was arrested.</p>
<p>Named by Christopher Columbus, the Virgin Islands are divided between the UK, the US, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Around 35,000 BVI residents have been British citizens since 2002. While they enjoy limited self-governance under a 2007 constitution, the state is officially designated as one of the British Overseas Territories, known as crown colonies prior to 1983.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Islamabad reiterates its commitment to Gates’ public-health initiatives in the second call this week</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The influential chief of the Pakistani Army, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, has held a phone conversation with billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, reassuring him that Islamabad is committed to working with the Microsoft co-founder&rsquo;s foundation on eradicating polio and other global health initiatives.</p>
<p>In an exchange&nbsp;that took place on Friday, Gates praised the Pakistan Army for <em>&ldquo;supporting the country's polio drive and ensuring proper reach and coverage,&rdquo;</em> while Bajwa said,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;credit goes to all involved in the process,&rdquo;</em> according to a Saturday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1687567/gen-bajwa-bill-gates-discuss-polio-eradication-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> by the Inter-Services Public Relations.</p>
<p>Gates also commended Pakistan&rsquo;s efforts in battling the Covid-19 pandemic; Bajwa again attributed it to a <em>&ldquo;true national response&rdquo;</em> by multiple agencies. The army chief applauded Gates&rsquo; global health efforts, and reportedly assured the philanthropist of <em>&ldquo;continued cooperation.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the newly elected prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, also held a phone conversation with the billionaire philanthropist, receiving reassurances that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) will continue supporting Pakistan&rsquo;s government to help ensure that no child is at risk of being paralyzed by polio.</p>
<p>The country had gone more than a year without a single new polio case &ndash; a feat that Gates hailed after traveling to Islamabad to meet with then-Prime Minister Imran Khan in February &ndash; but in April, officials confirmed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1687498/pakistan-reports-second-polio-case-in-10-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two new infections</a> in 15 months.</p>
<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s parliament elected Sharif as prime minister last month, after Khan was ousted in a no-confidence motion. Khan had claimed that his cabinet was overthrown in a plot arranged by the US and that Pakistan was being handed over to an <em>&ldquo;imported government led by crooks.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The social media company will still “fight for inclusion and diversity” after Musk’s buyout, aggrieved staff were assured</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>In an <em>&ldquo;emergency meeting&rdquo;</em> on Friday, employees of Twitter reportedly complained to CEO Parag Agrawal and diversity officer Dalana Brand that new owner Elon Musk is allegedly an <em>&ldquo;open homophobe and transphobe." </em>They also&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;expressed fears&nbsp;for their futures at the company.</p>
<p>The <em>&ldquo;impromptu&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;get together was reported on Saturday by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-all-hands-elon-musk-response-employee-reaction-2022-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, which claimed to have obtained leaked audio of proceedings. According to the news site, Agrawal fielded questions from staff concerned that they could lose their jobs amid rumors that Musk is planning on slashing executive pay.</p>
<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter has already led to some high-stress&nbsp;encounters&nbsp;in the firm&rsquo;s Silicon Valley offices.</p>
<p>While unable to reassure everyone that they would keep their positions, Agrawal &ndash; who Inside said looked <em>&ldquo;tired and annoyed&rdquo;</em> &ndash; said that <em>&ldquo;for the people who are here, it will be worth it to be here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Some of the staff fretted that their company may no longer be known for its left-wing corporate culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What should we tell the LGTBQ community at recruiting conferences we're lined up to attend when they ask us why they should come work at Twitter when we just sold ourselves to an open homophobe and transphobe?&rdquo;</em> one reportedly asked Chief People and Diversity Officer Dalana Brand.</p>
<p>Brand, who was appointed to her position back in February, said that while she <em>&ldquo;cannot speak to Elon's personal feelings on these things,&rdquo;</em> she would ensure that <em>&ldquo;we'll continue to fight for inclusion and diversity for all of our teams. Full stop.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Musk, a prolific Twitter user, does not have a history of anti-LGBT remarks, but has criticized Twitter&rsquo;s management for censoring the Babylon Bee, a satirical outlet that was suspended from the platform for referring to Biden administration official Rachel Levine (who is transgender) as <em>&ldquo;man of the year.&rdquo;</em> Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-05/elon-musk-opined-about-buying-twitter-after-babylon-bee-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> earlier this month that Musk reached out to him after the ban and mused that <em>&ldquo;he might need to buy Twitter.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Musk has also criticized Twitter management for censoring an incriminating story about President Joe Biden and his family&rsquo;s overseas business dealings before the 2020 election, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519377424437243904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused</a> the site&rsquo;s legal counsel, Vijaya Gadde, of harboring <em>&ldquo;left wing bias.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Gadde &ndash; who oversaw the censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story and is said to have ordered the banning of former US President Donald Trump from the platform &ndash; reportedly broke down <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554582-twitter-leaks-musk-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crying</a> during an earlier meeting of Twitter&rsquo;s top executives. During the meeting, Gadde allegedly wept <em>&ldquo;as she expressed concerns about how the company could change&rdquo;</em> under Musk&rsquo;s ownership, Politico reported.</p>
<p>The Tesla tycoon purchased Twitter on Monday for the sum of $44 billion, vowing to take it private and return the platform to its roots as <em>&ldquo;the free speech wing of the free speech party.&rdquo;</em> While a strident critic of censorship in all forms, Musk has <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554577-musk-backtracks-free-speech-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since said</a> that he will run Twitter in accordance with relevant laws.</p>

                            <p><strong>Previously opposed to sanctioning Moscow, President Aleksandar Vucic has come under intense pressure from Washington to relent</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said that he will issue a statement on possible anti-Russia sanctions early next month, but will be guided by <em>&ldquo;the interests of Serbia&rdquo;</em> alone. Vucic has vehemently opposed penalizing Moscow for its offensive in Ukraine, but has come under pressure from the US to change his stance.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As for us and the imposition of sanctions, I will talk about this more and more thoroughly on May 6,&rdquo;</em> Vucic told reporters at a military expo near Belgrade on Saturday, according to RIA Novosti. While acknowledging that he has been under pressure from unnamed politicians to acquiesce to the West&rsquo;s sanctions regime, Vucic added that <em>&ldquo;our policy should be a policy of responsibility, a policy of development for Serbia, which will think about the interests of Serbia at every moment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>From the outset of the conflict in Ukraine, Vucic has sought to maintain relations with both the West and Russia. Although Serbia voted for a United Nations resolution condemning Russia&rsquo;s military operation, Vucic later said that he was <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553532-serbia-blackmail-un-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blackmailed</a> into doing so, with his country threatened with energy sanctions if it refused.</p>

<p>However, Vucic has since categorically refused to sanction Moscow. After being re-elected with 58% of the vote earlier this month, he stated that banning the import of Russian oil and gas would cripple the Serbian economy, and imposing sanctions would be <em>&ldquo;immoral and inefficient,</em>&rdquo; citing the hardship his own country suffered under EU, UN and US sanctions in the 1990s.</p>
<p>However, shortly after Vucic&rsquo;s electoral victory, a trio of US senators visited Belgrade in a bid to win the president over to the West&rsquo;s side. <em>&ldquo;We understand Serbia has a long cultural and economic history with Russia,&rdquo;</em> Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-moscow-serbia-chris-murphy-europe-611c2053f2ebf79a609e29b444b418f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> after meeting with Vucic. <em>&ldquo;But this is a moment where there is great risk if we&hellip;don&rsquo;t send a united message about the consequences of Russia&rsquo;s behavior in Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Murphy added that the US would continue to support Serbia&rsquo;s path to joining the European Union, a journey that likely depends on siding with the West against Moscow.</p>
<p>Serbia is a traditional ally of Russia, and anti-Western and particularly anti-NATO sentiment runs high in the country. NATO forces waged an <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/552650-nato-bombing-serbia-remains-unrecognized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air war</a> against Serbia on behalf of Kosovan separatists in 1999, paving the way for UN peacekeepers to occupy Kosovo, severing the province from Serbia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, even Vucic&rsquo;s decision to join the UN vote condemning Russia in February led to a thousands-strong <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/553965-serbia-belgrade-protest-vucic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-Russia protest</a> on the streets of Belgrade.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I don't care about either Western or Eastern embassies. I don't care about the Americans, or the Russians, or the Europeans, or anyone else. I will make decisions in accordance with the interests of the Republic of Serbia,&rdquo;</em> Vucic said on Saturday.</p>

                            <p><strong>In the latest round of a dispute over Nazi compensation claims, Germany wants to protect its properties in Rome from seizure</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Germany is suing Italy in the top UN court in the latest round of long-standing dispute over Nazi compensation claims, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) revealed on Friday.</p>
<p>In its application Germany claims that Rome has continued to allow Nazi war crime victims to file requests for compensation from Berlin, even though in 2012 the ICJ ruled that it is illegal. In the claimant&rsquo;s view, by doing so Italy<em> &ldquo;has violated, and continues to violate, its obligation to respect Germany&rsquo;s sovereign immunity.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Germany therefore argues that Rome must <em>&ldquo;take effective steps&rdquo;</em> to prevent such<em> &ldquo;violations&rdquo;</em> from happening in the future, to provide all relevant guarantees,<em> &ldquo;to make full reparation&rdquo;</em> for any injury caused, and to cover <em>&ldquo;any financially assessable injury resulting from proceedings conducted.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Berlin says that it is aware of at least 25 Third Reich crimes-related cases which have been brought against Germany in Italian domestic courts since the 2012 court decision. Some of the proceedings resulted in rulings ordering Germany to pay compensation. To enforce the rulings, Italian authorities have been trying to seize four German state-owned properties in Rome, including buildings housing the German Archaeological Institute and the Goethe Institute.</p>

<p>Germany explained that despite confirmation of the non-commercial status of these properties by the Italian government, the Court of Rome has proceeded with the enforcement process and on 25 May 2022 will announce its decision on whether to put the buildings up for sale at a public auction.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Under the circumstances, and as further detailed below, Germany is now compelled to seek provisional measures from the Court in order to safeguard its rights against irreparable harm,&rdquo;</em> Germany&rsquo;s application states.</p>
<p>The dispute between Germany and Italy over compensation claims for Nazi crimes started in 2008 when Berlin was ordered by the highest Italian court to pay approximately 1 million euros to the families of nine victims, killed by the Germans in 1944 in Tuscany. Germany argues that since the end of the World War Two and Nazi regime&rsquo;s defeat it has paid billions of euros to the countries affected in accordance with peace and reparation treaties.</p>
<p>No date was immediately set for hearings at the ICJ. Rulings by the United Nations court, which normally considers cases for years, are final and legally binding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The Foreign Secretary’s campaign against China and Russia indicates that London has lost the plot</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A fanatical Neoconservative, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss presents world affairs in an uncompromising ideological struggle between "democracy" and "authoritarianism."</p>
<p>She also seems to be addicted to the fervour of Cold War.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61251698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Her address on Wednesday night in London</a> bordered on showing desire for war against Russia and China simultaneously. By first calling to <em>"</em><em>push</em><em> Russia out of the whole of Ukraine,"</em> Truss described the conflict as "our war," then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-truss-tells-china-its-rise-depends-playing-by-rules-2022-04-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proceeded to turn to China and taunt Beijing that its rise "was not inevitable."</a> demanding that they "play by the rules" and even arguing that NATO should defend Taiwan in a potential contingency. Truss once again called for a "a network of liberty" and urged to avoid economic dependencies on undesirable countries (again a reference to Russia and China).</p>
<p>But, unfortunately for Truss and despite the climate we now exist in, none of this huffed-up rhetoric has any serious basis in reality. Yet, if she gets her way, the potential dangers are existential: The British Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s rhetoric is spoiling for direct conflict not just against one but two nuclear &nbsp;superpower adversaries. To try and oust Russia from Crimea and to prevent China from taking Taiwan if it moves to do so are both scenarios which could result in a military response, potentially even a nuclear one. This doesn't seem to faze Truss, and European leaders will probably not be happy with this, even if her masters in Washington will be delighted to hear it. However, it ultimately speaks to a wider truth that the hubris and nostalgic vigour of Brexit is driving Britain off a cliff edge, deposing its foreign policy of any kind of reason, restraint, moderation or realism about its current place in the world.</p>

<p>The story of Britain's foreign policy since 1945 might be summarized as that of a declining Empire going through stages of grief. If the Suez Crisis represented anger and denial, then Britain's bid to join the European Economic Community in the 1970s represented bargaining and acceptance. Yet, it didn't last. Britain's Anglophone exceptionalist identity, compounded of course by the geographic conditioning of separation from mainland Europe, produced a very different historical experience from that of its neighbours. While France and Germany have recent memories of widespread devastation from centuries of wars, Britain, unscathed and undefeated, sees its history as that of triumph and lacks the pragmatism of its counterparts.</p>
<p>As a result, the British Empire faded away as opposed to facing a &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo; of sorts, meaning British public opinion was never &ldquo;reset&rdquo; and continues to believe it was a force for good, allowing the political right to continue to iconize it, and it is precisely this nostalgia of Imperialism which has manifested itself in the form of Brexit amongst many in the Conservative Party. Given in reality that Brexit itself has brought no economic benefits whatsoever, the Johnson government has sought to compensate for this by doubling down on nationalistic rhetoric and the euphoria of "Britannia rules the waves". The slogan of "Global Britain" is essentially a code word for Empire, the connotation of a country aloof from the internal squabbling of European politics that instead pursues ambitious trade ventures all over the world and seeks to militarily dominate all in the name of moral and ideological exceptionalism.</p>

<p>It should be no surprise that this rhetoric is getting worse as the UK economic environment deteriorates. <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-effects-of-russias-war-push-uk-inflation-to-fresh-30-year-high-of-7-12588628#:~:text=Consumer%20price%20inflation%20rose%20by,the%20fastest%20for%2030%20years&amp;text=Inflation%20remains%20at%20its%20highest,1990%2C%20according%20to%20the%20ONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation is at a 30-year high,</a> energy prices are out of control, Covid-19 has scuppered the economy and, worse still, Boris's own government is deeply unpopular after being rocked by an ever-recurring series of scandals, and is looking for whatever distractions it can muster. Against this backdrop, and with the conflict in Ukraine, is it really surprising that Liz Truss is being allowed to thunderously call for Cold War and, potentially, even a hot one? This is not a manifestation of Britain's strength, as dangerous as these comments may be, but a display of Britain's weaknesses. The current government has nothing else going for it than to appeal to nationalist and Imperialist sentiment by entertaining the possibility of war with other great powers and invoking the historically offensive Opium-wars-style rhetoric against China. But reality of course is different. Truss won't admit it, but the UK needs China as a critical post-Brexit economic partner, and of course we all know there is no chance Russia will be driven out of Ukraine. It seems implausible that despite her position and given not even Boris himself is so staunchly anti-China, that she has the actual influence to singlehandedly achieve her vision.</p>
<p>So, while this rhetoric may be dangerous, it's also empty talk at best from an increasingly unpopular government that wants to create as much noise as possible before the local elections, but that isn't stopping Truss from doing as much damage as possible to Britain's standing in the world as she can in her own aspirations for leadership first. Yet the fact the Foreign Secretary has been reduced to this kind of talk is emblematic of the broader problems Britain is facing, a country whose identity and aspirations are chronically out of touch with reality. It is no longer a projection of triumph, but one of woes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree on Saturday granting amnesty to Syrians for terrorist crimes up to the end of April, except those leading to death. Assad has extended similar olive branches to deserters, criminals and opposition fighters before, often to the displeasure of the US.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Assad&rsquo;s decree, first reported by Syrian <a href="https://sana.sy/?p=1639080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state media</a> on Saturday, <em>&ldquo;grants a general amnesty for terrorist crimes committed by Syrians before [Saturday], except for those that led to the death of a person.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While the pardon frees terrorists from criminal prosecution, it does not exempt them from civil lawsuits brought by those they may have harmed.</p>

<p>Those pardoned would have been prosecuted under a 2012 anti-terrorism law and a 1949 provision of Syria&rsquo;s legal code, and as such will affect the various terrorist groups fighting in Syria&rsquo;s civil war, which began in 2011. Assad, with the help of Russian forces, has broadly succeeded in maintaining control of Syria against a collection of opposition militias and terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and Al-Nusra Front.</p>
<p>Throughout more than a decade of war, Assad has periodically offered pardons to his opponents. Military deserters who didn&rsquo;t take up arms with terrorists were given <a href="https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=148449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amnesty</a> in 2018 and allowed to return to Syria, while a general amnesty for misdemeanors and juvenile crimes was granted in 2021.</p>
<p>However, at the outset of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Assad attempted to offer opposition fighters amnesty in exchange for surrender. This offer was rejected by the United States, with State Department official Victoria Nuland advising the opposition to ignore Assad&rsquo;s offer and continue fighting.</p>
<p>The Syrian Foreign Ministry at the time accused Washington of <em>&ldquo;inciting sedition&rdquo;</em> with this advice and <em>&ldquo;supporting acts of killing and terrorism.&rdquo;</em> The war would continue, and Nuland would go on to oversee the violent overthrow of democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine in 2014, and is currently shaping US policy on Ukraine as President Biden&rsquo;s under secretary of state for political affairs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare of the Solomon Islands called Australia’s protests over its security pact with China “hysterical”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has accused Australia of being hypocritical in its opposition to the Pacific country&rsquo;s recent security pact with China. He argued that Canberra had not consulted with its other partners last year when it unveiled a security deal with the US and Britain, known as AUKUS, which paves the way for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I learned of the AUKUS treaty in the media. One would expect that as a member of the Pacific family, Solomon Islands and members of the Pacific should have been consulted to ensure this AUKUS treaty is transparent,&rdquo;</em> Sogavare told his country&rsquo;s parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>He added: <em>&ldquo;I realize that Australia is a sovereign country, which can enter into any treaty it wants to, transparently or not, which is exactly what they did with AUKUS.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>When Australia signed up to AUKUS we did not become theatrical and hysterical on the implications this would have for us. We respected Australia&rsquo;s decision.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A tiny archipelago state, the Solomon Islands sit roughly 2,000km (1,242 miles) northeast of Australia.</p>
<p>China and the Solomon Islands signed a security and cooperation treaty late last month. Frank Sade Bilaupaine, an adviser to the islands&rsquo; government, said the arrangement had been devised after the recent unrest in his country&rsquo;s capital Honiara. In November 2021, a mob torched the parliament building and burned down the local Chinatown district.</p>
<p>The treaty had drawn ire in Australia, as well as in the US and New Zealand, all of which regularly trade diplomatic jabs with Beijing.</p>

<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last week that a Chinese military base on the islands would be a <em>&ldquo;red line.&rdquo;</em> Daniel Kritenbrink, a senior US diplomat responsible for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, similarly said that Washington would have <em>&ldquo;significant concerns&rdquo;</em> over a new Chinese base in the region.</p>
<p>The Chinese Defense Ministry, however, denied that it had plans to set up an outpost in the Pacific country.</p>
<p>Asked about Sogavare&rsquo;s recent statement on Friday, Morrison argued that there was<em> &ldquo;a remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said on Thursday that the pact with the Solomon Islands was<em> &ldquo;not targeted at any third party.&rdquo;</em> He added that Australia had no right to meddle in Beijing&rsquo;s relations with other states. <em>&ldquo;If this is not a violation of other countries&rsquo; sovereignty, an interference in other countries&rsquo; internal affairs and violation of international rules, [then] what is?&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Beijing has argued that AUKUS undermines peace and stability in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>At least 15,000 new species-to-species viral transmissions could take place over the next 50 years, as global warming drives wild animals to migrate toward human territory, according to a study published on Thursday. Researchers warned that these animals could spread diseases like SARS, Ebola, or Zika to humans, with Africa and Asia most at risk.</p>
<p>While some argue that the Covid-19 pandemic likely began in a laboratory, many scientists <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/new-studies-support-wuhan-wet-market-as-origin-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believe</a> that the coronavirus first jumped to humans at a <em>&ldquo;wet market&rdquo;</em> in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Such markets &ndash; where live animals and meat are sold alongside each other &ndash; have long been condemned as <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00023-07?permanently=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotspots</a> of animal-to-human viral transmission, but scientists are now warning that climate change could replicate the conditions of a wet market on a global scale.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04788-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>, published in the &lsquo;Nature&rsquo; journal on Thursday, predicts that a rise in global temperatures of even less than two degrees Celsius will shift the habitats of some wild animals closer to those of people, potentially introducing humans to tens of thousands of viruses currently restricted to the wild.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The closest analogy is actually the risks we see in the wildlife trade,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://gumc.georgetown.edu/news-release/new-study-finds-climate-change-could-spark-the-next-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> lead author Colin Carlson, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center. <em>&ldquo;We worry about markets because bringing unhealthy animals together in unnatural combinations creates opportunities for this stepwise process of emergence &mdash; like how SARS jumped from bats to civets, then civets to people. But markets aren&rsquo;t special anymore; in a changing climate, that kind of process will be the reality in nature just about everywhere.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Bats, the study predicted, will drive the majority of transmission. This is because they are known reservoirs of viruses, make up around 20% of all mammal species and can fly long distances. As a <em>&ldquo;global hotspot of bat diversity,&rdquo;</em> Southeast Asia will be a flashpoint for new transmission, the researchers warned. However, more than 3,000 species of mammal will likely migrate to new habitats, and densely-populated areas like Africa&rsquo;s Sahel region, India and Indonesia, will also be at risk, the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>The study rests on several assumptions: that the world will continue getting hotter, that animals will migrate as predicted, and that the pathogens they carry will find a way to infect humans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unclear exactly how these new viruses might affect the species involved,&rdquo;</em> co-lead author Gregory Albery said, <em>&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s likely that many of them will translate to new conservation risks and fuel the emergence of novel outbreaks in humans.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Even if global warming is kept under the 2 degrees threshold, described as a <em>&ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo;</em> in the Paris Agreement, future viral spillovers may happen anyway, Carlson&rsquo;s team warned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When a Brazilian free-tailed bat makes it all the way to Appalachia, we should be invested in knowing what viruses are tagging along,&rdquo; </em>Carlson said.<em> &ldquo;Trying to spot these host jumps in real-time is the only way we&rsquo;ll be able to prevent this process from leading to more spillovers and more pandemics.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>‘Tiger Meet’ exercises are taking place in Greece</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Turkey will not participate in NATO drills amid escalating tensions with neighboring Greece, local&nbsp;media reported on Saturday, citing security sources. Ankara was scheduled to send its F-16 Fighting Falcon jets to the annual &lsquo;Tiger Meet&rsquo; drill, which will be held at the Araxos Air Base in western Greece from May 9 to May 22.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Turkish Air Force Command considered that the wording used by Athens&nbsp;in technical documentation relating to the drills was contrary to international law and demanded that it be changed, but Greece refused to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Despite all of Turkey&rsquo;s attempts and conciliatory efforts, Greece, which could not tolerate even its neighbor&rsquo;s participation in an exercise in its country, moved the exercise away from the purpose of friendship and interoperability and tried to use it against Turkey&rsquo;s rights and interests,</em>&rdquo; a security source claimed, as quoted by Sabah newspaper.</p>
<p>As a result, on April 22, Turkey made a decision not to participate in the drills and informed the host country of its withdrawal, according to the reports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some sources suggest it was actually Greece that decided not to allow Turkey to participate in the NATO exercises in retaliation for regular violations of its&nbsp;airspace by Ankara's&nbsp;jets. According to the Voice of America&rsquo;s report, Athens&nbsp;revoked Turkey&rsquo;s planned participation in &lsquo;Tiger Meet&rsquo;, saying Turkey was &ldquo;<em>neither an ally, nor a friend</em>.&rdquo;<br /><br />On Thursday, the Greek Foreign Ministry expressed to the Turkish ambassador its strong protest over &ldquo;<em>the unprecedented number of violations of Greek airspace and overflights of Greek territory, including over several inhabited areas, carried out within one day</em>.&rdquo;<br /><br />The statement did not specify an exact number of violations but, according to the media, 125 unauthorized flights were reported within 24 hours.<br />The ministry underlined that &ldquo;<em>these actions create a climate of particular tension in the relations between the two countries, which runs contrary to the efforts undertaken to improve this climate.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ankara&nbsp;claims it is taking retaliatory measures for the violation of Turkish airspace by Greek planes. Officials&nbsp;claimed on Thursday that Athens had violated its airspace &ldquo;<em>30 times in three days</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These mutual accusations constitute just one of several points of contention between Ankara and Athens. Last year, Greece put its military on high alert because of seismic exploration by Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean region, which Athens considers its continental shelf.</p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s meeting of Greek Prime Minister Kiryakos Mitsotakis with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was considered by many as a promising event but, since then, Greece has reportedly suspended &lsquo;confidence-building&rsquo; negotiations with Turkish officials, which were planned for May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A conviction for corruption that barred Lula from seeking another term in office was invalidated last year by Brazil’s top court</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Brazilian authorities violated former President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva&rsquo;s due-process rights during a corruption case that later barred him from seeking a third term in office, a UN panel has ruled.</p>
<p>The left-wing politician, widely known simply as Lula, has long claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated and was aimed at preventing him from running in elections.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Although the Supreme Federal Court vacated Lula&rsquo;s conviction and imprisonment in 2021, these decisions were not timely and effective enough to avoid or redress the violations,&rdquo;</em> Arif Bulkan, a member of the UN Human Rights Committee, said.</p>
<p>Lula governed Brazil between 2003 and 2010, having comfortably won elections twice, and left office with an approval rating of 80%. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison after being convicted of corruption and money laundering amid Operation Car Wash, one of the biggest corruption investigations in Brazil&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>That sentence was later increased to 12 years, effectively barring Lula from competing in the 2018 presidential election, in which he was the frontrunner.</p>

<p>Three years later, Brazil&rsquo;s Supreme Federal Court annulled Lula&rsquo;s conviction, ruling that former judge Sergio Moro, who oversaw the investigation against Lula and was later appointed justice minister, had no jurisdiction to investigate and try the case and could not be considered to have been impartial.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the UN panel confirmed that Moro had violated Lula&rsquo;s right to privacy when he approved the request to tap the leader&rsquo;s phone, the phones of his family and that of his lawyer, and then released the content of the wiretaps to the media before formally charging Lula with a crime. The panel also noted that a warrant to detain Lula for questioning had also been leaked to the media.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The UN decision yesterday showed the shameful actions that were done to prevent me from becoming the president of the republic,&rdquo;</em> Lula tweeted in response to the UN&rsquo;s ruling. <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to prove anything. Those who have invented lies against me have to prove it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Operation Car Wash was launched in 2014, after Lula had left office. The investigation began as a probe into graft and bribery within the state-run oil company Petrobras and was later expanded to include wider corruption in the highest echelons of power.</p>
<p>The ensuing scandal led to the impeachment of Lula&rsquo;s successor Dilma Rousseff in 2016. She also denied all allegations, calling herself a <em>&ldquo;victim of a coup.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lula told RT in 2018 that there was <em>&ldquo;a conspiracy in Brazil between the media, the judiciary, the prosecution service and police&rdquo;</em> against him.</p>
<p>Investigative website The Intercept released a trove of documents in 2019, which appeared to show that Moro had broken the country&rsquo;s judicial code of ethics by providing advice and tips to lead Car Wash prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol. Moro said the messages had been taken out of context, and that there was <em>&ldquo;no sign of any abnormality or directing of actions as a magistrate.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Canadian police said seven people were arrested and 24 vehicles were towed at a motorcycle rally in downtown Ottawa on Friday.</p>
<p>Bikers rolled into the country&rsquo;s capital, while a group of anti-Covid mandate protesters on foot gathered outside the parliament building, some holding Canadian flags and playing loud music.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There have been no reported injuries, and police remain in full control of city streets,&rdquo;</em> the Ottawa Police Service said, as vehicles were barred from entering certain areas around Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>The organizers were not clear about the goal of the Rolling Thunder rally, saying only that they wanted to <em>&ldquo;peacefully celebrate our freedom.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Canadian media, however, reported that the event is linked to Freedom Fighters Canada (FFC), a group that opposes Covid-19 mandates and other so-called&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;tyrannical&rdquo;</em> legislation.</p>

<p>Neil Sheard, a key Rolling Thunder organizer, said on Monday that bikers were against blocking the streets, property damage, or <em>&ldquo;hate and vitriol directed to the residents of Ottawa.&rdquo;</em> He said the bikers will leave the city after the two-day event ends, according to the Ottawa Citizen daily.</p>
<p>Mayor Jim Watson said before the rally that the city wanted to avoid traffic disruptions that occurred during the Freedom Convoy protests earlier this year.</p>
<p>People rallying against the vaccine mandate rolled hundreds of trucks and other vehicles onto the streets in downtown Ottawa for weeks in January and February. To deal with the truckers, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time since it was adopted in 1988. Police dispersed the convoy, making multiple arrests.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have all hands on deck on this,&rdquo;</em> Watson said on Monday. <em>&ldquo;No one wants a repeat of what happened during the truckers&rsquo; convoy, and that&rsquo;s why I believe that we are more proactive and better-prepared to deal with the issue.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Twitter spat followed the actor's call for young Brazilians to vote in the upcoming election and help save the Amazon rainforest</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has given a sarcastic reply to movie star and eco-activist Leonardo DiCaprio, who called on the country's young people to cast their ballots in the October 2 election, implying they should help remove the right-wing head of state from office.</p>
<p>DiCaprio, a long-standing critic of Bolsonaro's environmental record, took to Twitter on Thursday to point out that &ldquo;Brazil is home to the Amazon and other ecosystems critical to climate change.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What happens there matters to us all and youth voting is key in driving change for a healthy planet,&rdquo;</em> he wrote, attaching a link to a website with explanations on how to register in the election.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro responded on Friday with an ironic message, suggesting the Hollywood star was actually backing him.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thanks for your support, Leo! It's really important to have every Brazilian voting in the coming elections. Our people will decide if they want to keep our sovereignty on the Amazon or to be ruled by crooks who serve foreign special interests,&rdquo;</em> he wrote.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">- Thanks for your support, Leo! It&#39;s really important to have every Brazilian voting in the coming elections.

<p>The president then delivered another jab, publishing a screenshot of one of DiCaprio's posts on Instagram and insisting that the actor had used an old 2003 photo to illustrate the wildfires that ripped through the Amazon in 2019.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are people who want to arrest Brazilian citizens who make this kind of mistake here in our country. But I'm against this tyrannical idea. So I forgive you. Hugs from Brazil!&rdquo;</em> the 67-year-old wrote.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">- By the way, the picture you posted to talk about the wildfires in the Amazon in 2019 is from 2003.

<p>According to official figures, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has spiked by more than 75% compared to the previous decade, since Bolsonaro took office in 2019.</p>

<p>DiCaprio has previously backed calls from environmental groups demanding that all investment in Brazil be conditioned on the government's firm commitment to preserve the Amazon rainforest, often described as <em>&ldquo;the lungs of the planet.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, those attempts have been largely fruitless, with Bolsonaro rejecting them as an infringement on Brazilian sovereignty.</p>
<p>The president's approval ratings tumbled after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, with Brazil becoming one of the worst-hit countries in the world.</p>
<p>He has managed to win back the sympathies of some voters in recent months, but polls show he still trails his left-wing rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>
<p>A survey from pollster FSB Pesquisa earlier this week suggested that Lula, who was Brazil's president during a period of strong economic growth between 2003 and 2010, is on course to defeat Bolsonaro by 41% to 32% in the first round of the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The European Union&rsquo;s top border protection official has resigned following claims that years of rights abuses occurred under his watch, including the alleged mistreatment of migrants who arrived in the bloc&rsquo;s territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Fabrice Leggeri, a French national who headed up the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, commonly known as &lsquo;Frontex,&rsquo; confirmed his departure in a statement obtained by several media outlets on Friday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I give my mandate back to the Management Board as it seems that [the] Frontex mandate on which I have been elected and renewed in late June 2019 has silently but effectively been changed,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, after more than 2 years of investigations by <a href="https://twitter.com/LHreports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LHReports</a>, the head of the EU’s border agency Frontex resigned.

<p>While a European anti-fraud agency launched a probe into the abuse allegations last year, its findings have yet to be made public. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/LHreports/status/1519975882428928000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigations</a> by a consortium of regional media outlets have indicated that Frontex was aware of at least 22 cases of migrant &lsquo;pushbacks,&rsquo; when immigration authorities simply forced asylum seekers, arriving by boat, back out to sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The 22 &lsquo;pushbacks&rsquo; were conducted by both Frontex and Greek officials and involved more than 950 migrants, all occurring between March 2020 and September 2021, the media outlets reported &ndash; among them Germany's Der Spiegel, France's Le Monde, Switzerland's SRF et Republik and investigative NGO Lighthouse Reports.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Frontex convened an emergency meeting on both Thursday and Friday to address allegations against Leggeri and two other staffers at the agency. The former Frontex chief has denied the charges in the past, and the European Parliament issued a report on the matter last year.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Leader Kim Jong-un vows to preempt any nuclear threat to his country</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has&nbsp;promised to take decisive action and <em>&ldquo;crush&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>any&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;hostile&rdquo;</em> foreign power, just days after saying Pyongyang would advance its own atomic arsenal <em>&ldquo;at the fastest possible speed.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking after a meeting with senior officials involved in organizing a major military parade earlier this week, Kim pointed to growing threats in a world where <em>&ldquo;powers clash fiercely and keep getting stronger,&rdquo;</em> including in the nuclear sphere, arguing that <em>&ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo;</em> might is the only guarantee of his country&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In order to preemptively and thoroughly crush all threatening actions, including the continued and aggravated nuclear threat by the hostile forces, if necessary, the Party Central Committee will firmly maintain the absolute superiority of our revolutionary force and continuously raise it,&rdquo;</em> Kim said, as <a href="http://kcna.kp/kp/article/q/d5d3aa9c0742c7d65589b21879bbcdb3.kcmsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a> by the state-run KCNA.</p>

<p>The remarks follow a pledge from Kim earlier this week to <em>&ldquo;continue to take measures for further developing the nuclear forces of our state at the fastest possible speed,&rdquo;</em> insisting Pyongyang must be ready for a nuclear deployment <em>&ldquo;at any time&rdquo;</em> amid steadily rising tensions with the United States.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has carried out a series of weapons tests this year, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its first such launch since 2017 following a self-imposed moratorium on major arms tests. Those moves coincided not only with the Joe Biden presidency in Washington, but a change in leadership in Seoul more recently, with South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol taking a much harder line against the north than the prior head of state.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Yoon&rsquo;s predecessors &ndash; presidents Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in, respectively &ndash; made significant diplomatic inroads with Pyongyang, resulting in a number of summits, including a historic face-to-face meeting at the infamous demilitarized zone (DMZ). Those efforts later fizzled, however, leaving relations between all sides in limbo before Biden took office in 2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Agency probed almost 3.4 million US citizens in 2021 under foreign surveillance powers</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made queries into almost 3.4 million Americans between December 2020 and November 2021, the US intelligence community admitted in an official report on Friday. The FBI said it was looking for foreign hackers, but civil libertarian groups called it an <em>&ldquo;enormous&rdquo;</em> invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>The FBI alone made <em>&ldquo;fewer than 3,394,053&rdquo;</em> queries of US citizens&nbsp;in that time period, related to information collected under the controversial authority to spy on foreigners. The findings were made public in the Annual Intelligence Community Transparency Report, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/CLPT/documents/2022_ASTR_for_CY2020_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a>&nbsp;by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).</p>
<p>The electronic data was collected legally under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the document claims.</p>
<p>According to the ODNI, the number is due to <em>&ldquo;a number of large batch queries related to attempts to compromise U.S. critical infrastructure by foreign cyber actors&rdquo;</em> in the first half of 2021, which <em>&ldquo;included approximately 1.9 million query terms related to potential victims &ndash; including US persons.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This accounts for the <em>&ldquo;vast majority of the increase in US person queries conducted by FBI over the prior year,&rdquo;</em> the ODNI said. There were fewer than 1.3 million such queries in the December 201 to November 2020 period, according to the same findings.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My understanding is that some of this was about researching and doing an investigation into potential hacking and &mdash; so &mdash; but I will get you more from the FBI after this,&rdquo;</em> White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday when asked about the revelations.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has reacted, calling the FBI&rsquo;s behavior an invasion of privacy <em>&ldquo;on an enormous scale.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s report sheds light on the extent of these unconstitutional &lsquo;backdoor searches,&rsquo; and underscores the urgency of the problem,&rdquo;</em> ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Ashley Gorski said in a statement. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s past time for Congress to step in to protect Americans&rsquo; Fourth Amendment rights.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Section 702 allows the DNI and the US attorney general to target non-US persons located outside of the US in order to acquire foreign intelligence. The FISA process came under renewed scrutiny in recent years, after it emerged that the FBI <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/479033-doj-page-fisa-warrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improperly</a> used such warrants to spy on President Donald Trump and his campaign via campaign aide Carter Page. A <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/484633-doj-fisa-application-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> of 29 sample FISA applications undertaken by the Department of Justice inspector general in 2020 found errors in every single one.</p>
<p>Even after querying the information of 3.4 million Americans in 2021, the FBI opened exactly zero investigations of US persons who were not considered a national security threat, <em>&ldquo;based wholly or in part on an acquisition authorized under Section 702,&rdquo;</em> the ODNI report indicates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Arrest of the British Virgin Islands' leader on US drug charges has prompted London to act</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Shortly before the premier of the British Virgin Islands appeared before a US judge on charges of cocaine smuggling and money laundering, a commission of inquiry in London hurriedly published a report urging the UK to take direct control of the Caribbean territory, citing systemic corruption.</p>
<p>BVI Premier Andrew Alturo Fahie made a Zoom appearance on Friday before a US federal judge. He was arrested in Miami, Florida on Thursday, along with BVI Ports Authority director Oleanvine Pickering Maynard. They face drug trafficking and money laundering charges in a scheme the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claims involved Mexican cartels and the Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Just hours before Fahie was due in court, the commission of inquiry led by Judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom published its final report, recommending that London should dissolve the islands&rsquo; elected government, suspend their constitution, and impose direct rule.</p>
<p>Successive governments had <em>&ldquo;deliberately sought to avoid good governance by not putting processes in place and where such processes are in place by passing them or ignoring them as and when they wish &ndash; which is regrettably often,&rdquo;</em> Hickinbottom said in the report.</p>

<p>Hickinbottom said his recommendations came <em>&ldquo;with a heavy heart,&rdquo;</em> but <em>&ldquo;unless the most urgent and drastic steps are taken, the current situation with the elected government deliberately ignoring the tenets of good governance will go on indefinitely.&rdquo;</em> He urged Governor General John Rankin to take direct control of the islands&rsquo; domestic policy and budgets, set up an advisory body made up of locals, and conduct a year-long constitutional review.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the report showed <em>&ldquo;clearly that substantial legislative and constitutional change is required to restore the standards of governance that the people of the BVI are entitled to,&rdquo;</em> but did not officially announce direct rule.</p>
<p>Hickinbottom&rsquo;s commission was established in 2021, amid claims of corruption and wasteful government spending &ndash; as well as rumors that the island leadership was engaging in drug trafficking. According to The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/british-virgin-islands-direct-rule-andrew-fahie-drug-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian</a>, the British government was aware of the US undercover investigation, and decided to <em>&ldquo;rush out&rdquo;</em> the 1,000-page Hickinbottom report after Fahie was arrested on Thursday.</p>
<p>Fahie and Maynard were arrested at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport, according to an affidavit listing the charges against them. Maynard&rsquo;s son Kadeem Stephan Maynard has also been arrested, though it was not made clear when and where.</p>

<p>According to the affidavit, a DEA informant started meeting with <em>&ldquo;a group of self-proclaimed Lebanese Hezbollah operatives&rdquo;</em> on the BVI island of Tortola back in October 2021, which approached Fahie&rsquo;s security staff and said it <em>&ldquo;owned&rdquo;</em> Director Maynard.</p>
<p>The informant allegedly met with Oleanvine and Kadeem Maynard in March, and with both of them and Fahie on April 7, 2022, proposing to pay them a percentage of cocaine sales that would pass through BVI ports on the way to the US territory of Puerto Rico, and from there to the US mainland.</p>
<p>The informant testified he offered Fahie 12% of the expected sale price for the drugs, which worked out to $7.8 million, as well as to fund his re-election campaign. Fahie allegedly asked for $500,000 in advance and another $83,000 he needed to pay back a debt to someone in Senegal.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, the plan was to set up a test run for 3,000kg of cocaine in exchange for $700,000 in cash, which was left on a private jet at the Miami-Opa Locka airport. Fahie and Oleanvine Maynard were arrested when they showed up to claim the cash.</p>

<p>Named by Christopher Columbus, the Virgin Islands are divided between the UK, the US and the US territory of Puerto Rico. BVI residents have been British citizens since 2002. They are officially designated as one of the British overseas territories, called crown colonies prior to 1983.</p>
<p>The last time London imposed direct rule on an overseas territory was in 2009, when the Turks and Caicos Islands government was accused of corruption. Full local rule was restored in 2012. The Turks and Caicos had also been under direct rule in 1986-88, after their chief minister was accused of complicity in drug trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>During a speech in Beirut, the Hezbollah leader warned Tel Aviv against continued assaults on Syria </strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>If Israel continues attacking the Iranian presence in Syria, Tehran may retaliate directly, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday. He also warned Tel Aviv that the Shia militia will be on high alert for the upcoming Israeli military exercises near Lebanon.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;In the event of the continuation of the Israeli aggression against the Iranian presence in the region,&rdquo;</em> Iran may <em>&ldquo;attack Israel directly,&rdquo;</em> Nasrallah said during a video address at an event in Beirut. This was a reference to the frequent Israeli missile strikes on what the government in Tel Aviv says are Iranian targets inside Syria &ndash; most recently <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554579-damascus-missiles-syria-israel/">on Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong>By way of example, Nasrallah brought up the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/551812-iran-responsibility-missil-attack-erbil/">March missile strike</a> against a facility in Erbil, a city in northern Iraq, which Tehran said was used by Israel to plan and execute attacks on Iran.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The cleric also warned Israel that <em>&ldquo;any mistake, stupidity or aggressive act&rdquo;</em> during the upcoming maneuvers on the border of Lebanon would receive a <em>&ldquo;quick and direct&rdquo;</em> response.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;When the Israeli maneuvers begin, whether before the elections in Lebanon or afterward, we will be at the highest levels of alertness and readiness,"</em> said Nasrallah.

<p><strong></strong>Hezbollah has been quietly rehearsing for a number of scenarios over the past several weeks, and is prepared for any action by the <em>&ldquo;Israeli enemy,&rdquo;</em> according to Nasrallah.</p>
<p><strong></strong>As evidence that Israel is <em>&ldquo;fragile and weak,&rdquo;</em> Nasrallah brought up the series of recent attacks on civilians in Beersheba, Bnei Brak, Hadera and Tel Aviv, calling them <em>&ldquo;very specific and important&rdquo; and "among the most dangerous things the enemy is facing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>These operations show Israel&rsquo;s inability to discover <em>&ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo;</em> Muslim attackers and <em>&ldquo;strongly shook the confidence of the Zionists in their safety and their security services,"</em> said Nasrallah.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The prospect of a nuclearized Middle East underscores the need for more  diplomacy, not less</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-worried-iran-could-develop-nuclear-weapon-weeks-2022-04-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The White House on April 26</a> expressed concern that Iran is allegedly accelerating its nuclear program, saying Tehran could obtain sufficient fissile material for one nuclear bomb within weeks. The remarks echoed those previously coming from the Department of State, underscoring a potential new theater in an already deteriorating global security landscape &ndash;&nbsp;even if this assessment may not to be accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-705119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to reports in the Israeli media</a>, Washington and Tel Aviv are discussing alternative methods to deal with the potential for a nuclear Iran. This is because, per these reports, the US has essentially abandoned the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, also called the &ldquo;Iran nuclear deal&rdquo;) framework, i.e. a diplomatic route to address the issue. It raises the question of whether a<a href="https://www.jns.org/opinion/bomb-iran-to-stop-a-wider-war-in-europe-and-protect-taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> military response</a> would be on the table in the absence of any viable diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, over 40 former top European officials, including former foreign and defense ministers from over half a dozen countries, <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran/open-letter-us-and-iranian-leadership-about-iran-nuclear-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an open letter</a> urging the US and Iran to conclude their negotiations on returning to the 2015 JCPOA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter noted the most contentious issue in the negotiations, the designation of Iran&rsquo;s Islamic Republican Guard Corps as a &ldquo;Foreign Terrorist Organization,&rdquo; has obvious compromises &ndash; even if those would be politically complicated on the American domestic scene. It also bashed the last two years of US Iran policy as a bad legacy of former President Donald Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; campaign on Iran, which not only failed but made the world an objectively less safe place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These European leaders presented an astute assessment of the situation and really couldn&rsquo;t have said it better when it comes to Biden&rsquo;s policies. The fact is that Biden&rsquo;s unwillingness to negotiate political differences with Tehran, either adopting a compromise or presenting an alternative, is not a viable policy. It is dangerous and irresponsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, the United States might not be as well-equipped to engage in a hot war with Iran as it pretends to be, given the current global security situation.</p>
<p>The US is already involved in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, mobilizing a significant amount of its military production for weapon supplies to that theater. It is also actively involved in stoking tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. Already a major concern of US military strategists has been<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/strategy-avoiding-two-front-war-192137?mc_cid=757e34d487&amp;mc_eid=ad640e23d4&amp;page=0%2C3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> avoiding a &ldquo;two-front war&rdquo; </a>involving Russia and China, never mind a three-front war now involving Iran.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conflict in Ukraine actually serves as a case in point for why the US should de-escalate with Iran. Prior to Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;special military operation,&rdquo; the US promised a powerful, unrelenting response to any incursion into Ukraine by Moscow. Those words were hollow &ndash; and it has sent a clear message, as have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/us-left-78000-afghan-allies-ngo-report-rcna18119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other events around the world</a>, that the US is a fundamentally unreliable partner on security issues. The fact is that the US is simply not prepared for the consequences of its dangerous escalations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second of all, the US is politically isolated on this matter with only Israel truly on its side. Europe clearly understands that a nuclear arms race in the Middle East is a direct threat to its security and has the potential for serious spillover. This is why Europe has been leading on the JCPOA issue ever since the US withdrew and has been hosting negotiations. European leaders have routinely urged the US to rejoin under Biden &ndash; calls which have regrettably been ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the world, i.e the actual international community, is very clearly on the side of de-escalation and against nuclear proliferation. Anything which could further these preferences would be seen as desirable, meaning Washington&rsquo;s unwillingness to come to the table is clearly resented by the international community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>White House officials must come to their senses on the JCPOA, get to the negotiating table and come to an agreeable solution with Tehran. The timeframe of a few weeks presented by White House press secretary Jen Psaki may serve as a suitable deadline to get this done as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing so would not only help improve a destabilized global security situation that arguably makes nuclear proliferation a legitimate national defense strategy for countries under &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; but would also serve to improve America&rsquo;s reputation around the world. Failure to do so would mean further deterioration of global security and more resentment against Washington for understandable reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>US senators drafted a weapons scheme for Kiev weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A scheme to send US weapons to Ukraine, using the <em>&ldquo;lend-lease&rdquo;</em> formula pioneered during WWII to skirt neutrality laws, was officially approved by Congress this week. However, it was put together all the way back in January &ndash; more than a month before Moscow recognized the Donbass republics as independent and sent troops into Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Republican Senator John Cornyn introduced the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, also known as S.3522, on January 19, 2022. This is according to the official <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3522/all-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congress.gov page</a> for the bill. On the same date, it was co-sponsored by senators Benjamin Cardin, Jeanne Shaheen and Roger Wicker.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham endorsed it the very next day, January 20. Other endorsements trickled in over the following weeks, with a total of 14 senators on board by February 9, again according to Congress.gov.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Russia did not recognize the independence of Donetsk and Lugansk until February 21. The <em>&ldquo;special military operation&rdquo;</em> to demilitarize Ukraine began on what was already February 24 in Washington.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee only took up Cornyn&rsquo;s proposal on April 6. It was approved unanimously, proposed on the floor by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and adopted by voice vote &ndash; whereupon it sat in limbo for weeks while the Democrat-dominated House was on vacation. On Thursday, after an hour of pro-forma debate, the <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554628-congress-lend-lease-ukraine/">House approved it</a> in a 417-10 vote. Every single Democrat voted in favor, while all 10 dissenters were Republicans.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Supporters and critics alike have made much of the proposal, named after a WWII-era scheme to bypass neutrality laws limiting US arms exports. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt concocted lend-lease in March 1941, months before the US entered WWII, to send billions of dollars worth of weapons to Britain, and later the Soviet Union and other countries.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Cornyn&rsquo;s bill, by contrast, suspends two existing US laws to make it easier for the White House to ship all sorts of weapons to Ukraine. It eliminates the five-year limitation on the program duration, suggesting the US hopes the conflict goes on for a long time &ndash; but also conditions the aid on Ukraine eventually repaying the <em>&ldquo;lease&rdquo;</em> or returning the gear if in working condition.</p>

<p>Cornyn has so far not revealed what might have motivated him to introduce the scheme to <em>&ldquo;protect civilian populations in Ukraine from Russian military invasion&rdquo;</em> before any military operations began.</p>
<p><strong></strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554710-lend-lease-ukraine-us/"></a>The motivations of his first co-sponsor, Cardin, are more obvious. He is the architect of a series of anti-Russian laws, starting with the 2012 <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/senate-magnitsky-bill-russia-832/">Magnitsky Act</a>, the 2016 Global Magnitsky Act, and the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/398446-us-sanctions-russia-breakdown/">2017 CAATSA law</a>, which tied the hands of the Trump administration in dealing with Russia.</p>

<p>In January 2018, at the height of the <em>&ldquo;Russiagate&rdquo;</em> craze, Cardin <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/415532-cardin-democrats-russia-report/">published a report</a> he commissioned from the Democratic staff on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accusing Russia of an <em>&ldquo;assault&rdquo;</em> on <em>&ldquo;democratic and transatlantic institutions and alliances,&rdquo;</em> using <em>&ldquo;disinformation, cyberattacks, military invasions, alleged political assassinations, threats to energy security, election interference, and other subversive tactics.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Arms supplies to Kiev only prolong suffering of Ukrainians and risk WWIII, an open letter by famous Germans outlines</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Germany should consider the risks of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev spreading beyond Ukraine&rsquo;s borders and plunging the world into a full-scale Third World War, dozens of leading German cultural figures have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in an open letter calling on him to stop sending arms to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The risk of Russia&rsquo;s military action in Ukraine escalating into a <em>&ldquo;nuclear conflict&rdquo;</em> should be avoided at all costs, the co-authors of the letter, <a href="https://www.emma.de/artikel/offener-brief-bundeskanzler-scholz-339463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the German feminist magazine Emma, have said, expressing their hope that Scholz would <em>&ldquo;remember [his] initial position&rdquo;</em> and would <em>&ldquo;not supply any more heavy weapons to Ukraine, either directly or indirectly.&rdquo;</em> Instead, Berlin should <em>&ldquo;do everything&rdquo;</em> to help the sides reach a ceasefire <em>&ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;</em> and to find a <em>&ldquo;compromise that both sides can accept.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Delivery of large quantities of heavy weapons &hellip; could make Germany itself a party to war. A Russian counter-attack could then trigger a response under the NATO Treaty and [result] in an immediate danger of a world war,&rdquo;</em> the letter warns.</p>
<p>The co-authors of the letter, including German musicians, artists and filmmakers, have warned that the continued provision of arms to the Ukrainian forces risks starting <em>&ldquo;a global arms race with catastrophic consequences,&rdquo;</em> including for global health and for climate change. It has been signed by, among others, the ex-vice president of the Bundestag Antje Vollmer, who previously co-authored another similar letter to Scholz, and Martin Walser, one of the most prominent authors in post-war Germany and a winner of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade.</p>
<p>The co-authors do say that they consider Russia&rsquo;s military action in Ukraine <em>&ldquo;aggression,&rdquo;</em> adding, however, that even <em>&ldquo;legitimate resistance&rdquo;</em> by Ukrainians has reached an <em>&ldquo;intolerably disproportionate&rdquo;</em> level, since it only prolongs the suffering of Ukrainians themselves.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think that responsibility for a potential nuclear conflict would lie only with the side that would start it but not with those, who <em>&ldquo;openly provide it with a reason&rdquo;</em> to take this step, the letter argues. <em>&ldquo;Morally binding norms are universal in nature,&rdquo;</em> it points out.</p>

<p>The appeal, which has since been opened for sympathetic signatures, was <a href="https://www.change.org/p/offener-brief-an-bundeskanzler-scholz?redirect=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> by almost 8,000 in just two hours.</p>
<p>Last week, another open letter calling on Berlin to cease its arms supplies to Kiev was signed by a group of German politicians and public figures, who also warned Scholz about the risks of Germany and other NATO nations becoming parties to the conflict and risking <em>&ldquo;another big war.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The German government has, so far, not reacted to any of the letters.</p>
<p>The developments come as Berlin is still mulling sending 100 old Marder infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) to Ukraine. Earlier this week, the German government reportedly promised a swift decision on the deal, which is still pending approval by the authorities, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Earlier in April, Scholz said that Germany would send only <em>&ldquo;correct and reasonable&rdquo;</em> weapons to Kiev, adding that there have been no plans to send <em>&ldquo;offensive&rdquo;</em> weapons, such as tanks, notwithstanding repeated Ukrainian requests. His position apparently did not sit well with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who called for more weapons to be sent to Kiev, adding that <em>&ldquo;now is not the time for excuses.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Germany &ndash; together with other NATO members &ndash; has been supplying Ukraine with arms almost since the start of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev.

                            <p><strong>Amid violent riots Magdalena Andersson has admitted serious flaws in country’s migrantion policy</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Segregation in Swedish society has gone &ldquo;<em>too far</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;and the integration of immigrants is &ldquo;<em>too poor</em>,&rdquo; Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson admitted on Thursday, following the violent riots there earlier this month. The unrest erupted after an anti-Muslim politician, Rasmus Paludan, announced a burning &ldquo;<em>tour&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;of the Quran during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>The riots saw dozens of people arrested, a school set on fire and more than 100 police officers injured, in a country where, during the migration crisis of 2015, around 163,000 migrants requested asylum &ndash; more people per capita than in any other EU nation.</p>
<p>Commenting on these events during a press conference, Andersson said that &ldquo;<em>segregation has been allowed to go so far</em>&rdquo; and that it has resulted in the appearance of &ldquo;<em>parallel societies</em>&rdquo; in Sweden, living in &ldquo;<em>completely different realities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In Andersson's opinion, integration has been &ldquo;<em>too poor</em>&rdquo; because society was &ldquo;<em>too weak,</em>&rdquo; and resources provided for the police and social services has been insufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We will have to reassess our previous truths and make tough decisions</em>,&rdquo; the prime minister, who represents the Swedish Social Democratic Party which has been heading the government since 2014, told reporters.</p>

<p>Minister of Integration and Migration Anders Ygeman, who spoke at the same press conference, said in turn that the issue of gang crime cannot be solved without addressing the problem of segregation. Therefore, he announced, the Swedish government plans to introduce further measures to strengthen the police and to ensure better control over vulnerable youth behavior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Everyone who receives support must also meet certain expectations,</em>&rdquo; Ygeman underlined.Sweden&rsquo;s foreign-born population has doubled in the last two decades and now amounts to two million, which is a fifth of the whole country's population. Since receiving a record-breaking number of immigrants in 2015, and with more than 40% of Swedes considering that number too high (according to an Ipsos survey in 2016), the country's government implemented restrictions that made the country's immigration policy one of the toughest in Europe.</p>
<p>These new measures, along with the state providing police with additional surveillance powers, have drawn criticism from human rights defenders, including Amnesty International.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Some 8,000 British soldiers will participate in drills, Defence Ministry says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>British troops are getting ready for one of their largest deployments in Europe since the cold war, the Defence Ministry (MoD) has said.</p>
<p>Thousands of UK soldiers are going to be sent to countries ranging from North Macedonia to Finland in the coming months to take part in joint drills with their counterparts from NATO, Finland, and Sweden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected that the deployment is going to peak at some 8,000 troops between April and June. Dozens of British tanks and more than a hundred armored vehicles will also arrive in Europe this summer.</p>
<p>The plans of a large-scale deployment have been in the works for some time, but they were enhanced in the wake of Russia&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine, the MoD said. The upcoming wargames are aimed to <em>&ldquo;showcase the scale and significance of the British Army&rsquo;s contribution to the defence of Europe,&rdquo;</em> it added.</p>
<p>The drills are going to be <em>&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;</em> to Britain&rsquo;s contribution to European defence and the deterrence of Russia, Commander Field Army Lt Gen Ralph Wooddisse insisted.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>The British soldiers have also been training together with US forces in Poland, the MoD said. It also announced that troops from the Queen&rsquo;s Royal Hussars have just been deployed to Finland, which shares a 1,300-km-long border with Russia, to be embedded in an armored brigade.</p>
<p>Russia has always decried military drills and NATO buildup near its borders, saying that those moves increased tensions in the region and put Europe at risk of a major confrontation.</p>
<p>The UK has established itself as one of Ukraine&rsquo;s main backers and arms suppliers amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. London has already sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems and is sending armored vehicles to Kiev, among other things. Ukrainian troops have also been receiving training from the British Army both on home soil and in the UK.</p>
<p>Arms deliveries to Ukraine by Britain, the US and some European nations continue, despite Moscow warning that they only prolong the conflict and hamper the prospects of peace.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Moscow reported several successful strikes on arms depots in Ukraine where it said Western-supplied hardware and ammunition were stored.</p>
<p>Russia sent its troops to Ukraine in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing is using 'all instruments' of its 'national power' to challenge the United States, the Navy’s top uniformed official said</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A senior US military officer has identified China as a <em>&ldquo;focal point&rdquo;</em> for the Navy, citing the <em>&ldquo;phenomenal growth&rdquo;</em> of Beijing&rsquo;s military and its ambitious goals for the years ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o89acQi3GLY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event</a> hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Thursday, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday called for a <em>&ldquo;whole-of-government approach to deterring China,&rdquo;</em> arguing the country is <em>&ldquo;challenging us through all instruments of their national power.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We certainly have a lot of respect for them based on their ability to learn and evolve,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;Thinking about the facts related to China and their phenomenal growth in the military dimension, but also in the economic dimension, not just regionally but globally &ndash; they&rsquo;ve exceeded every deadline they&rsquo;ve ever set for themselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The admiral went on to note that while Beijing had once set a deadline of 2050 to become <em>&ldquo;a global power,&rdquo;</em> it has since moved up that timeframe, first to 2035, and more recently to 2027.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;And so we take that &rsquo;27 timeframe, that President Xi [Jinping] has talked about publicly, very seriously,&rdquo;</em> Gilday said, adding that Washington therefore seeks to maintain capabilities to <em>&ldquo;fight tonight&rdquo;</em> if needed.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In terms of keeping an edge over Chinese forces, Gilday said he would like to see more funding devoted to <em>&ldquo;weapons that are going to matter in a fight,&rdquo;</em> arguing Congress should <em>&ldquo;max out domestic production lines for weapons at range, speed, lethality, and capability in 2023.&rdquo;</em> He added that the US has maintained <em>&ldquo;enduring advantages&rdquo;</em> with its submarine force, as well as in the areas of quantum computing, artificial intelligence and unmanned vehicles and vessels.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Asked about American cooperation with allied states in Asia, the Navy official noted that he had spent significant time with his counterparts in India, a nation he deemed a <em>&ldquo;huge strategic partner in the future&rdquo;</em> with respect to confronting China in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re concerned about China, you can&rsquo;t build a navy fast enough to understand what&rsquo;s going on in [the Indian Ocean],&rdquo;</em> Gilday said, summarizing his discussions with Indian officials. He noted that New Delhi had&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;joined the coalition maritime force in the Fifth Fleet,&rdquo;</em> a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/at-22-ministerial-dialogue-india-and-us-call-for-immediate-cessation-of-hostilities-in-ukraine/article65314212.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US-led multinational body</a> active in waters near the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.</p>
<p>Gilday&rsquo;s comments are in line with similar statements from US officials in recent years, and the Biden administration has repeatedly named Beijing as Washington&rsquo;s top competitor on the world stage. Since Joe Biden took office in 2021, the military has conducted near-monthly transits of the disputed Taiwan Strait, which China considers part of its maritime territory, as well as other areas of the South and East China Seas. The Pentagon has also urged lawmakers time and again to step up funding for China-related &lsquo;deterrence,&rsquo; including the construction of a multi-billion dollar <em>&ldquo;highly survivable, precision-strike&rdquo;</em> missile network located not far from Beijing&rsquo;s shores.</p>

                            <p><strong>Danish health officials say the inoculation campaign could resume in the autumn, however</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p></p>
<p>Denmark has become the first country in the world to suspend its Covid-19 vaccination drive, as officials point to increasingly strong immunity among residents.</p>
<p>The Danish Health Authority <a href="https://www.sst.dk/da/Nyheder/2022/Vaccinationsprogrammet-mod-covid-19-afrundes-snart-for-denne-saeson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the move earlier this week, saying that due to vaccinations and recovery from natural infection, <em>&ldquo;total immunity of the population is therefore high,&rdquo;</em> and that the inoculation program would be wound down over the coming weeks.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Spring has arrived, vaccine coverage in the Danish population is high, and the epidemic has reversed,&rdquo;</em> the agency said in a statement. <em>&ldquo;Therefore, the National Board of Health is now ending the broad vaccination efforts against Covid-19 for this season.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Those who wish to complete an ongoing round of vaccinations will&nbsp;be able to do so, but the health authority said it would no longer invite residents to make appointments beginning May 15.</p>

<p>However, officials continue to recommend <em>&ldquo;vaccination for people at particularly increased risk,&rdquo;</em> who will have access to certain immunization sites that remain open across Denmark, and warn that a new vaccine campaign may be required next fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Danish Health and Medicines Authority's assessment is that there will probably be a need to vaccinate against Covid-19 again in the autumn,&rdquo;</em> the statement said, noting that the agency also expects to see <em>&ldquo;an increase in infection again as we go from autumn to winter.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Denmark's vaccination campaign was launched in late 2020, and since then the vast majority of its 5.8 million citizens have received at least two doses, according to the government, while 3.6 million have received booster shots.</p>

                            <p><strong>Service members talk of a ‘shadow policy’ that lets Pentagon get rid of unruly troops</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US government is still mandating all members of the military to get a Covid-19 vaccine and discharging those who refuse &ndash; even on religious grounds &ndash; in what amounts to a deliberate purge of troops with beliefs the current Pentagon considers wrong, a sergeant and two officers told the podcast hosted by Republican congressman Matt Gaetz on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaetz (R-Florida), who hosts a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1519775759560286209">podcast</a> called &lsquo;Firebrand,&rsquo; said he wants to propose an amendment that would ban mandates for experimental vaccines and restore rank and pay to those forced to leave the military, but admitted that some of his Republican colleagues might not support it, not to mention the majority Democrats.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you are a believer and you are listening to this podcast, you need to understand that God-fearing service members are being intentionally purged from the services,&rdquo;</em> said one of his guests, Air Force Captain Jordan Karr.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a House Armed Services Committee member, I&#39;ll be introducing National Defense Authorization Act amendments to ban mandates for experimental COVID-19 vaccines and restore rank &amp; pay for anyone who was forced or coerced to leave the military as a consequence of these vaccines. <a href="https://t.co/r21lTido4n">pic.twitter.com/r21lTido4n</a></p>&mdash; Rep.

<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a purposeful purge,&rdquo;</em> argued Army Major Samuel Sigoloff. <em>&ldquo;Anyone who would disobey an unlawful order is being purged out of the military,&rdquo;</em> he added, alleging there is a <em>&ldquo;shadow policy&rdquo;</em> in place to protect the leadership doing this.</p>
<p>Karr, Sigoloff and Air Force Master Sergeant Nickolas Krupper made their case against the mandate by bringing up religious freedom, natural immunity, and the discrepancy between the jabs used under emergency authorization and the one officially approved, which technically isn&rsquo;t available in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though they are legally distinct, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/qa-comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-mrna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidance</a> says that Pfizer&rsquo;s emergency-use vaccine and the officially approved Comirnaty <em>&ldquo;can be used interchangeably&hellip; without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>All three service members face <em>&ldquo;involuntary separation&rdquo;</em> over their refusal to get the jab, but have sued the Defense Department on religious exemption grounds. They technically remain on active duty until the lawsuits are resolved. Sergeant Krupper pointed out he is two years away from retirement and would lose his pension and family medical benefits if the USAF kicks him out.</p>
<p>About 3,400 troops have been fired for refusing the jab this year, service heads in charge of personnel told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. Only the US Navy has elected to honorably discharge its sailors, allowing all 798 of them to keep their benefits.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps accounted for nearly 2,000 separations, making up nearly 1% of its total strength of 215,000.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General David Ottignon, deputy commandant for manpower and reserve, insisted this had <em>&ldquo;no operational impacts across the force for readiness,&rdquo;</em> however. <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one community that has signaled an instance where a [leader], an NCO or another enlisted Marine is not present because of that,&rdquo;</em> he told lawmakers.</p>
<p>While Gaetz wondered if the vaccine mandate would harm recruiting going forward, the generals said any troop shortages were due to a <em>&ldquo;rising economy&rdquo;</em> and low unemployment rate, according to the <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/04/28/troops-allege-militarys-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-is-a-religious-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Military Times</a>. The US GDP <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/554684-us-economy-unexpected-slowdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually shrank</a> by 1.4% in the first quarter, according to figures published Thursday, which the Biden administration blamed on the conflict in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Ivy League school vows to earmark $100mn to make amends for ties to slavery</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>An internal committee commissioned by Harvard University has published an exhaustive inquiry into the prestigious school&rsquo;s history and ties to slavery and the study of eugenics, university president Lawrence Bacow announced on Tuesday, adding that the school was setting aside $100 million to &ldquo;<em>make amends</em>&rdquo; for its past transgressions.</p>
<p>Harvard profited from &ldquo;<em>the beneficence of donors who accumulated their wealth through slave trading; from the labor of enslaved people on plantations in the Caribbean islands and in the American South; and from the Northern textile manufacturing industry, supplied with cotton grown by enslaved people held in bondage</em>,&rdquo; the <a href="https://legacyofslavery.harvard.edu/report/introduction-and-findings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>, published on Tuesday by the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, revealed.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;<em>more than a third of the money donated to or promised to Harvard by private individuals came from just five men who made their fortunes from slavery and slave-produced commodities</em>,&rdquo; including cotton, the report found.</p>

<p>Bacow initially formed the committee in 2019 in order to probe the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>historic ties to slavery - direct, financial, and intellectual</em>.&rdquo; Its report found that from 1636 to 1783, the school enslaved 70 people, some of whom were responsible for caring for the university&rsquo;s presidents, professors and students.</p>
<p>Harvard didn&rsquo;t just benefit from slavery - it took concrete steps to quash abolitionist sentiment on campus, according to the committee, which made a point of countering the popular narrative that places New England at the center of the &ldquo;<em>antislavery moment</em>&rdquo; and in particular casts Harvard&rsquo;s home state of Massachusetts as a &ldquo;<em>hotbed of opposition to slavery</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s medical school admitted three black students in 1850 but subsequently expelled them following complaints from white students and alumni, and only admitted an average of three black students per year as late as 1940, according to the report, which noted that Harvard was still promoting the study of eugenics - central to World War II-era &ldquo;<em>race sciences</em>&rdquo; - at the time. Harvard&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s college, Radcliffe, denied housing to its few black students.</p>
<p>Additionally, Harvard Law School&rsquo;s first professorship was established with the profits of the slave trade in the form of a bequest from Isaac Royall Jr., a rich slave merchant who left the school a hefty sum in his will in 1781. The university incorporated elements of the family&rsquo;s coat of arms into its law school seal, an issue which became controversial in 2016, leading to the retirement of the seal and Royall&rsquo;s denunciation as &ldquo;<em>the son of an Antiguan slaveholder known to have treated his slaves with extreme cruelty</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many such problematic &ldquo;<em>early benefactors</em>&rdquo; left their names on buildings and professorships and their images in statues sprinkled throughout campus, according to the report, which found that &ldquo;<em>the color line held at Harvard</em>&rdquo; despite the official collapse of slavery following the Civil War. Harvard&rsquo;s longest-serving president and other prominent academics were key figures in the study of eugenics, a pseudoscience used to justify racial segregation in the US and abroad - most infamously in Germany under the National Socialist regime.</p>

<p>The report recommends that the school&rsquo;s $100 million &ldquo;<em>Legacy of Slavery Fund</em>&rdquo; be &ldquo;<em>preserved in an endowment and strategically invested</em>,&rdquo; and Bacow has confirmed that while some of the funds will be available for &ldquo;<em>current use</em>,&rdquo; the balance will be held in an endowment. Some of the planned projects include expanding scholarship opportunities for descendants of slaves in the southern US and Caribbean, partnerships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and reaching out to build relationships with the descendants of those who were enslaved at Harvard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Harvard benefited from and in some ways perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral</em>,&rdquo; Bacow wrote in his letter accompanying the report, arguing the school bears &ldquo;<em>a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society</em>.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The foreign ministry in Beijing 'deplores' a US top diplomat’s comments on Taiwan and UK's calls for “global NATO”</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Beijing has condemned statements from London and Washington about arming Taiwan, pointing out that such talk fuels separatism on the disputed island and goes contrary to their recognition of China. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken have both come out in support of sending weapons to Taiwan this week.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We deplore and reject Secretary Blinken&rsquo;s statement at a congressional hearing on April 26 that the administration is determined to make sure that Taiwan has all necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression,&rdquo;</em> Xie Yongjun, head of the information department at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, <a href="https://twitter.com/XIEYongjun_CHN/status/1519706897040822273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> on Thursday in reference to multiple outlets having noticed Blinken&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Xie was echoing the words of MFA spokesman Wang Wenbin from the news briefing on <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202204/t20220427_10674583.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wednesday</a>. Wang told reporters that US statements clash with their recognition of Beijing and the One China policy, and encourage Taiwanese separatists by selling weapons to the island.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;The US admits that Taiwan is part of China, but keeps talking about the mainland&rsquo;s potential &lsquo;aggression&rsquo; of Taiwan. Isn&rsquo;t this self-contradictory since a country can not &lsquo;invade&rsquo; part of its own territory?&rdquo;</em> said Wang.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We have this stern warning for the US side: The historical trend of China&rsquo;s reunification cannot be held back, and the one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,&rdquo;</em> Wang added, warning Washington to <em>&ldquo;not underestimate the strong resolve, determination and capability of the 1.4 billion Chinese people in defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity&rdquo; </em>or risk bringing<em> &ldquo;unbearable cost to the US itself.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>During Thursday&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202204/t20220428_10675164.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">briefing</a>, Wang also addressed the speech by the British foreign secretary, in which Truss argued for <em>&ldquo;a global NATO&rdquo;</em> to engage in the <em>&ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo;</em> and arm Taiwan the way the UK and its allies are now arming Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;NATO claims to be a defensive organization, but in fact it is constantly creating confrontation and disturbances,&rdquo;</em> Wang told reporters. <em>&ldquo;NATO demands that other countries abide by the basic norms of international relations, yet has wantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;The impact of NATO&rsquo;s eastward expansion on the long-term peace and stability of Europe is worth reflecting upon. NATO has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?&rdquo;</em> Wang added.&ensp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Truss&rsquo;s fiery speech also drew the attention of Global Times, China's English-language state daily, which on Thursday featured an <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1260636.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">editorial</a>&nbsp;describing London as increasingly willing to serve as a <em>&ldquo;pebble&rdquo;</em> in Washington&rsquo;s global hegemony.</p>
<p>Having left the EU and enjoying a special relationship with the US, the UK often says and does things <em>&ldquo;that are inconvenient for Washington and at times being even more aggressive,&rdquo;</em> the outlet noted. <em>&ldquo;Some politicians in London now increasingly see this as a source of uniqueness and superiority. The more they do this, the more they seem to feel the lingering warmth of the UK&rsquo;s prior status as &lsquo;The Empire on which the sun never set&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The US and UK actions amount to <em>&ldquo;a series of small-circle activities &hellip; in the name of the so-called common values and the culture that prioritizes Anglo Saxons,&rdquo;</em> said the editorial, adding that the world is increasingly recognizing this. <em>&ldquo;Truss and her ilk attempt to bring NATO to Asia and try to destabilize the Pacific, but they are doomed to fail. Treating China as a &lsquo;systemic competitor&rsquo; is also definitely a big misjudgment in the &lsquo;Global Britain&rsquo; strategy.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sweden does not plan to hold a referendum on the subject of NATO membership if its parliament approves of the measure, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson announced on Thursday, suggesting that putting the matter to a vote would be a &ldquo;<em>bad idea</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t think it is an issue that is suitable for a referendum</em>,&rdquo; the Swedish leader told reporters, implying that Parliament&rsquo;s support was sufficient. &ldquo;<em>There is a lot of information about national security that is confidential, so there are important issues in such a referendum that cannot be discussed and important facts that cannot be put on the table</em>,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>The Swedish parliament is conducting an overview of security policy, with plans to release a report on the subject by the middle of next month. With a majority of Parliament reportedly backing membership in NATO, Andersson&rsquo;s own party, the Social Democrats, is considered the primary obstacle to Stockholm signing on to the 30-country alliance. However, Ulf Kristersson, head of the leading opposition party, the Moderates, agrees that a referendum is a bad idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Voters &hellip; are not naive about Russia</em>,&rdquo; he told Aftonbladet earlier in the week during a debate with the head of the Left Party, Nooshi Dadgostar, claiming it was &ldquo;<em>very clear the Swedish voters have understood what happened</em>&rdquo; on the day Russia invaded Ukraine &ldquo;<em>and have drawn their conclusions.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Left Party is against joining NATO, and Dadgostar argued Swedes should have a say in the matter, stating that it &ldquo;<em>has to go back to the voters, there has to be very strong democratic support in this question.</em>&rdquo; A poll published by Aftonbladet last week indicated 57% of Swedes supported NATO membership, a 6% increase from the previous month.</p>
<p>Sweden and Finland are planning to simultaneously submit membership applications to NATO in mid-May, local media have reported, citing government sources. The Nordic countries&rsquo; leaders claim Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine altered the &ldquo;<em>whole security landscape</em>&rdquo; of the region. Moscow, however, has warned against such a move, suggesting it will be forced to strengthen its regional defenses should NATO expand to its borders. While Sweden had initially planned to wait until the end of the month to publish its security analysis, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde cited Finland&rsquo;s already-published report as the reason for stepping up her country&rsquo;s timetable, declaring that &ldquo;<em>there is now a lot of pressure</em>&rdquo; for Stockholm to release its own conclusions. However, polls indicate Finnish support for NATO membership is markedly higher (68%) than it is in Sweden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg declared on Thursday that the alliance was prepared to back Ukraine&rsquo;s fight against Russia for &ldquo;<em>years</em>&rdquo; and to update the nation&rsquo;s weapons systems to modern &ldquo;<em>NATO-standard weapons and systems that will also require more training</em>,&rdquo; even as Russia warned that continuing to supply heavy weaponry to Kiev would pose a threat to European security and &ldquo;<em>provoke instability.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moscow earlier this week accused NATO of &ldquo;<em>essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy</em>&rdquo; following the destruction of a Ukrainian arms depot packed with foreign weapons in Zaporozhye. The Pentagon rejected the claim. The alliance has doubled down on its support for Kiev, with the US hosting a 40-country meeting in Germany to bring even non-NATO nations on board to support the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>As Berlin commits to sending Kiev weapons, Germans make do with energy austerity and worry this may prolong the war</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Even as the Bundestag voted to send heavy weapons to Ukraine, a majority of Germans fear that continuing to supply Kiev may cause the conflict to expand to other countries. Berliners&nbsp;are also coming up with creative ways to cope with the spike in energy prices caused by the EU sanctions against Russia, according to interviews with a Telegram channel.</p>
<p><strong></strong>On Thursday, the German parliament voted 586-100 to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons, even though Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/554356-germany-russia-ukraine-war/">cautioned last week</a> that the Bundeswehr stockpiles have just about run out. A <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Mehrheit-findet-Scholz-Kurs-richtig-article23290979.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent poll</a> showed 56% of Germans are worried this could result in the conflict expanding to other countries, while only 26% believe there is a military resolution to the Ukraine crisis.</p>
<p><strong></strong>A Telegram channel called &lsquo;Kanzlerdaddy&rsquo; <a href="https://t.me/kanzlerdaddy/714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewed</a> some passersby&nbsp;on the streets of the capital to see if the Bundestag&rsquo;s decision reflected the will of the people.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s terrible. It&rsquo;s a crime. German weapons have no place there,&rdquo;</em> said one elderly lady, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good because we&rsquo;re being dragged into a war that shouldn&rsquo;t concern us. It might not be the most popular opinion, but I don&rsquo;t want a war to come here,&rdquo;</em> said an older gentleman.</p>

<p>In another <em>&ldquo;people on the street&rdquo;</em> video, &lsquo;Kanzlerdaddy&rsquo; <a href="https://t.me/kanzlerdaddy/697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked Berlin residents</a> how they are coping with the current energy situation. Temperatures in the German capital still dip down to five degrees Celsius at night, but heating is a luxury for many.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always looking to save money on utilities,&rdquo; </em>said a middle-aged man.<em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to use less electricity and gas at home, and not heat my apartment too much &hellip; I drive less now.

<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m great at conserving energy at home,&rdquo;</em> said a woman.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I close the refrigerator door quickly, turn off the lights, and don&rsquo;t heat my apartment too much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>Germany relies on imports of Russian natural gas for much of its energy needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I always try to save on heating. I prefer to put on a sweater at home instead of switching on my radiator,&rdquo;</em> another woman said. <em>&ldquo;I always switch off the lights when I leave the room.

                            <p><strong>Putin's spokesperson has denounced the British foreign secretary’s calls to send ‘heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes’ to Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Moscow has warned London that by<em> &ldquo;pumping&rdquo;</em> Ukraine with weapons, Britain is undermining European security. The remark came after the British foreign secretary urged Western states&nbsp;to provide Ukraine with <em>&ldquo;heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes,&rdquo;</em> while also bolstering the defense capabilities of Moldova and Georgia.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists by phone on Thursday, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the <em>&ldquo;tendency itself to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine and other countries is something that threatens the continent&rsquo;s security and provokes instability.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss delivered her keynote speech on Wednesday.</p>
<p>She argued against the view that <em>&ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something worse,&rdquo;</em> insisting that<em> &ldquo;inaction would be the greatest provocation&rdquo;</em> in the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Truss claimed that the <em>&ldquo;architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> with the <em>&ldquo;economic and security structures that were developed after the Second World War and the Cold War&rdquo;</em> having been<em> &ldquo;bent out of shape.&rdquo;</em> This, she suggested, requires a <em>&ldquo;new approach&rdquo; which &ldquo;melds hard security and economic security&rdquo;</em> and contributes to the creation of <em>&ldquo;stronger global alliances.&rdquo;</em> The foreign secretary urged <em>&ldquo;free nations&rdquo;</em> to be<em> &ldquo;more assertive and self-confident&rdquo;</em> and build their strategies on the assumption that <em>&ldquo;geopolitics is back.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Truss also proclaimed that the <em>&ldquo;war in Ukraine is our war,&rdquo;</em> with Kiev&rsquo;s victory being a <em>&ldquo;strategic imperative&rdquo;</em> for Britain and its allies. She went on to call for<em> &ldquo;heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes&rdquo;</em> to be provided to Ukraine, adding that <em>&ldquo;we need to do all of this.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In addition, the West <em>&ldquo;must ensure that, alongside Ukraine, the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom,&rdquo;</em> Truss emphasized.</p>
<p>According to the top UK diplomat, NATO should integrate Finland and Sweden <em>&ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;</em> if the two Nordic nations choose to join the military bloc.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to Russia&rsquo;s previous warnings, Truss described Britain as a <em>&ldquo;risk taker&rdquo;</em> which <em>&ldquo;has always stood up to bullies&rdquo;</em> and is <em>&ldquo;prepared be bold.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Kremiln&rsquo;s response to those remarks follow Moscow&rsquo;s repeated condemnation of NATO arms deliveries to Ukraine. Russia insists that the shipments only hamper the prospects for peace in the country. The Kremlin also made it clear that any military hardware deliveries would be considered a legitimate target once they cross into Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NATO is essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy. War means war,&rdquo;</em> Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.</p>
<p>Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following Kiev&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>Former president Medvedev issued a stark warning after German parliament voted in favor of heavy weapons deliveries to Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Dmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia&rsquo;s president from 2008 until 2012, has alluded to how the Second World War ended for Germany, after Berlin lawmakers supported the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a post published on Thursday on his Telegram channel, Medvedev suggested that sitting German lawmakers are envious of the <em>&ldquo;laurels of their predecessors who sat in the German parliament under a different name in the last century.&rdquo;</em> The Russian official warned that a situation like that<em> &ldquo;ends sadly&rdquo;</em> for the German parliament.</p>
<p>The close ally of President Vladimir Putin is&nbsp;currently the deputy chairman of the country&rsquo;s security council.</p>
<p>Medvedev's&nbsp;remarks came shortly after the German Bundestag passed a motion demanding that the federal government in Berlin deliver heavier and more complex weaponry to Kiev, so that Ukraine is better equipped to defend itself in the face of the Russian offensive.</p>
<p>Titled<em> &ldquo;Defend peace and freedom in Europe &ndash; comprehensive support for Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> the document was backed by 586 lawmakers, with 100 more voting against and seven abstaining.</p>
<p>Proposed by the ruling coalition and the Christian democratic opposition, the motion calls for an <em>&ldquo;acceleration of the delivery of more effective, also heavier weapons and more complex systems by Germany.&rdquo;</em> The lawmakers, however, noted that the shipments should not be carried out at the expense of Germany&rsquo;s own defense capabilities.</p>
<p>During the debate, lawmakers from the right-wing Alterative for Germany and Left parties opposed the proposal.</p>

<p>On top of the call for heavy weaponry to be provided to Ukraine, the motion also gave backing to all the steps taken by Olaf Scholz&rsquo;s government up to now, including sanctions against Russia and assistance in the investigation of alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine. Moreover, the lawmakers supported the German government&rsquo;s push to make the country less dependent on Russian energy.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The German Bundestag condemns Russia&rsquo;s brutal aggressive war against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms,&rdquo;</em> the motion reads. The document also accuses the Kremlin of <em>&ldquo;breaking international humanitarian law in a blatant manner,&rdquo;</em> as well as attempting to <em>&ldquo;destroy the European peace order permanently.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On Tuesday, Germany&rsquo;s Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced that the government in Berlin had given the green light for the delivery of self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. She broke the news during defense talks hosted by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the American airbase Ramstein in Germany&rsquo;s Rhineland-Palatinate state.</p>
<p>Lambrecht explained that<em> &ldquo;Ukraine will order&rdquo;</em> hardware from German manufacturers and<em> &ldquo;Germany will pay.&rdquo;</em> To fund the scheme, Berlin would earmark some two billion euros, the minister said.</p>
<p>According to reports in the German media, defense firm Krauss-Maffei Wegmann could ship as many as 50 self-propelled anti-aircraft guns of the Gepard type, decommissioned by the German military back in 2010, but still in stock. Designed to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft, the hardware can also engage targets on the ground. German officials stopped short of divulging any concrete dates when Kiev could expect to receive the Gepards. Several German media outlets, however, reported that the hardware would first have to be refurbished by the manufacturer, before it could be shipped to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The planned delivery would come on top of the swap scheme under which eastern European nations donate their soviet-made heavy weaponry to Ukraine, and receive military hardware from Germany instead. Berlin also pledged to assist the Ukrainian military in terms of training.</p>
<p>Earlier in April, reports appeared in several German media outlets suggesting that the country&rsquo;s Rheinmetall arms manufacturer was prepared to sell 88 decommissioned Leopard tanks to Ukraine, along with ammunition, spare parts and tools. The company was reportedly awaiting the German government&rsquo;s approval to go ahead with the shipment.</p>

<p>Russia, for its part, has repeatedly criticized NATO arms supplies to Ukraine, insisting they hamper the prospect for peace in the country.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>In the first massacre ordered by the newly established Nazi Croatia, the Ustasha shot 180 Serb villagers near Bjelovar</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The so-called Independent State of Croatia was less than three weeks old when it carried out its first mass execution of Serbs, the group its founders designated for persecution and extermination long before their ally Nazi Germany formalized its<em> &ldquo;final solution&rdquo;</em> for European Jews.</p>
<p>Villages in the Slavonian plain generally stretch alongside roads, to maximize the arable land surrounding them. Gudovac is just one such village, on the western approach to Bjelovar, some 80 kilometers from the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Towards the eastern end of the village are the fairgrounds, where locals would bring their cattle and produce for trade. In the afternoon of April 28, 1941, they would become a killing field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gudovac massacre of almost 200 Serbs, rounded up from 10 nearby villages, would kick off a campaign of mass murder by the Ustasha. Soon they would move from bullets to more intimate implements: hammers, axes, knives and other blades, butchering their victims like cattle. Extermination camps at Jadovno, Pag and later the Jasenovac complex would become names of infamy and terror. The slaughter would last up until the very end of the war &ndash; when the Communist authorities would bury the memory of the dead in the name of building <em>&ldquo;brotherhood and unity&rdquo;</em> with their killers.</p>
<h3>A nest of Ustasha</h3>
<p>On April 6, the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany invaded what was then the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whose weak regency government had signed the Tripartite Pact with Berlin just days earlier, only to be overthrown in a coup. Adolf Hitler vowed to <em>&ldquo;wipe Yugoslavia off the map&rdquo;</em> &ndash; in part because the Serbs who made up the majority of its people humiliated Austria-Hungary in the previous world war, and led to its break-up in 1918.</p>

<p>Just four days after the invasion, Croatian separatists known as the Ustasha <em>(&ldquo;insurrectionists&rdquo;)</em> proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska, NDH). Originally clients of fascist Italy, the Ustasha were a nationalist movement that defined Croat identity through the prism of militant Roman Catholicism and hatred of the Orthodox Serbs, whom they dubbed <em>&ldquo;Eastern Schismatics.&rdquo;</em> The Ustasha regime would later publicly articulate their goal for the Serbs: convert a third, expel a third, and kill the rest.</p>
<p>Holocaust scholar Jonathan Steinberg, the late professor of modern European history at the University of Pennsylvania,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/antinato@topica.com/msg02238.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> the NDH targeting of Serbs as the <em>&ldquo;earliest total genocide to be attempted during World War II.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Within days of the NDH&rsquo;s establishment, local pogroms against the Serbs and Jews began. The Gudovac massacre was the start of something different, though: an organized campaign of mass arrests and executions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The man from Zagreb</h3>
<p>That the Ustasha rounded up and executed local Serbs at the Gudovac fairgrounds is a fact beyond dispute. The role of Eugen <em>&ldquo;Dido&rdquo;</em> Kvaternik, a senior Ustasha general, is a matter of some conjecture. It is known that he was in Gudovac on April 28, 1941. His presence suggests that the Ustasha government in Zagreb was directly involved in the events of that day. A day later, Kvaternik would leave for nearby Grubisno Polje, where he personally oversaw the mass arrest of some 500 Serbs, who were eventually killed.</p>
<p>Yet there is no documentary proof that Kvaternik himself gave the final order for the Gudovac massacre. Instead, responsibility was attributed to county commissioner Josip Verhas and Bjelovar police chief Aloysius Chukman, as well as the Gudovac head of the Croat Peasant Protection militia, Martin Cikos.</p>
<h3>The killing begins</h3>
<p>In the evening of April 27, someone fired at two of Cikos&rsquo; militiamen who were escorting a Serb they had detained. One of the militiamen and the Serb were killed, while the other was injured. It was never discovered who was responsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting word of the incident, Verhas and Chukman drove out from nearby Bjelovar during the night. They confronted Cikos and accused him of drunken indolence while his men were getting killed. Cikos had indeed been out drinking that evening, and with a local Serb no less. To prove his loyalty, the militia leader went back to the man&rsquo;s house and shot him. Then the round-up of the villagers began.</p>

<p>During the night, 10 more Serbs &ndash; residents of Gudovac and Stare Plavnice &ndash; were killed. Most of the adult Serb males of Gudovac had been rounded up by noon of April 28, after which the militia and the Ustasha began round-ups in other nearby villages: Veliko Korenovo, Malo Korenovo, Klokocevac, Prgomelje, Tuk, Rajic. In Stancici, Breza and Bolc, only the more prominent Serbs were taken, while the round-ups were more extensive elsewhere.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of April 28, some 70 Ustasha and militia members took the captives to the fairgrounds and shot them. Most of the wounded were finished off with knives. Three men who survived were taken to the hospital the following day, after the Germans showed up. Their fate was never established. Only two men managed to escape unharmed: Ilija Jaric from Veliko Korenovo and Milan Margetic from Rajic.</p>
<h3>Mass grave and German investigation</h3>
<p>After the execution, the Ustasha had the surviving villagers dig a mass grave and bury the dead, pouring calcium oxide (quicklime) onto the corpses. They did not bother to hide their actions, however, and &ndash; as noted earlier &ndash; Kvaternik was rounding up more Serbs the very next day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, four Serb women from Stare Plavnice visited a Bjelovar merchant whose sister worked as a translator for the German garrison commander. Marta Omchikus dutifully passed their message to her employer. The German commander visited the site on April 29, and the Wehrmacht troops were deployed there the very next day, to start the exhumations.</p>
<p>Between April 30 and May 5, some 177 bodies were exhumed and photographed by the Germans. The 11 Serbs killed the night before the execution had been buried elsewhere, though.</p>
<p>The Germans then arrested 40 of the Ustasha and militiamen who had carried out the massacre. At this point, however, Ustasha Interior Minister Mladen Lorkovic intervened to have them released, promising the German ambassador in Zagreb Siegfried Kasche that the incident would be investigated. It never was.</p>
<p>Instead, the Ustasha began rounding up and executing even more Serbs in the weeks and months and years that followed. In February 1942, an Ustasha company slaughtered 2,300 people in three villages outside Banja Luka, without firing a shot. Entire camps would be built, including one for children in Jastrebarsko, part of the notorious Jasenovac complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modern Croatian historians grudgingly concede that 350,000 Serbs may have been killed by the NDH &ndash; though German envoys in Yugoslavia had reported that the Ustasha bragged of killing that many by mid-1942. Their outrage and protests to Berlin were shrugged off by Adolf Hitler himself, who urged the Ustasha leader Ante Pavelic against showing <em>&ldquo;too much tolerance&rdquo;</em> for the Serbs.</p>
<p>In a twist of fate, Lorkovic himself ended up a victim of Pavelic, accused by the Ustasha leader in August 1944 of treason and a plot to betray the NDH to the advancing Allies.</p>
<h3>Oblivion and memory</h3>
<p>Ustasha atrocities created a problem for the post-war Yugoslav government, however. The Communists had successfully pressured the king to abdicate, with the backing of Western Allies, but had to figure out how to put the country back together. Communist leader Josip Broz Tito, a Croat himself, found the solution in <em>&ldquo;equity&rdquo;:</em> asserting moral equivalence of all non-Communist groups, from the openly Nazi-allied NDH to the royalist resistance in Serbia. If that meant downplaying the NDH genocide of Serbs, so be it</p>
<p>A mausoleum and an ossuary for the victims of Gudovac were erected on the fairgrounds in 1995, along with a statue of a man called <em>&ldquo;Bjelovarac,&rdquo;</em> by the sculptor Vojin Bakic. Both were destroyed in 1991, when Croatia again declared independence from Yugoslavia. While the Bakic sculpture was eventually restored, the mausoleum was not.</p>
<p>While evidence of the Gudovac massacre was being destroyed in Croatia, the authorities in Serbia managed to recover some of it by pure luck. In 2008, the Archive of Vojvodina, the northern Serbian province, received seven boxes of personal documents from a WWII veteran, Yugoslav diplomat and security official Slavko Odic. One of the finds in the boxes was a file with some 600 pages, titled &ldquo;<em>Ustasha atrocities in the NDH,&rdquo;</em> consisting mainly of German intelligence reports from 1941 and 1942.</p>
<p>One document is a letter from the German military command in Serbia to the German embassy in Zagreb, dated June 25, 1941. It refers to <em>&ldquo;fourteen photographs, sent by the Serb interior ministry, showing the way in which the Ustasha murdered Serbs in the village of Gudovac near Bjelovar.&rdquo;</em> Odic&rsquo;s documentation indeed contained fourteen photographs, labeled as taken in Gudovac or the <em>&ldquo;Bjelovar county area.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until May 2019 that the photographs and the full list of the names of the Gudovac dead would be published by the Vojvodina Archive. By then, Croatia had joined the EU and NATO, just as it had once been part of Hitler&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;European family of nations.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US House of Representatives has passed a non-binding bill calling for the assets of wealthy Russian individuals to be used to support Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US House of Representatives passed a non-binding bill on Wednesday, calling on President Joe Biden to impound the assets of wealthy Russian individuals believed to have ties to the Kremlin. Under the plan, confiscated capital would go toward supporting Ukraine.</p>
<p>Named the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, the bill was backed by 417 lawmakers, with eight voting against it.</p>
<p>The document urges the US president to &ldquo;<em>confiscate any property or accounts subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, valued over $2,000,000, and belonging to Russian energy companies or to foreign persons whose wealth is derived in part through corruption linked to or political support for the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), one of the lawmakers behind the bill, explained that under the legislation US authorities could seize luxury villas, yachts and airplanes belonging to wealthy Russian individuals and companies that have been sanctioned by the U.S.</p>

<p>According to the text, the assets should then be &ldquo;<em>held, used, administered, liquidated, or sold,</em>&rdquo; with President Biden using the funds &ldquo;<em>for the benefit of the people of Ukraine.</em>&rdquo; The money could be earmarked for &ldquo;<em>post-conflict reconstruction in Ukraine, humanitarian assistance,</em>&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;<em>assistance provided to the security forces of the government of Ukraine.</em>&rdquo; On top of that the confiscated assets could be used to &ldquo;<em>support refugees and refugee resettlement in neighboring countries and in the United States,</em>&rdquo; and fund &ldquo;<em>technology items and services to ensure the free flow of information to the Ukrainian people in Ukraine,</em>&rdquo; including what was described as &ldquo;<em>items to counter internet censorship by Russian authorities.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bill calls for the establishment of an interagency working group, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the helm, tasked with confiscating assets belonging to foreign individuals who are believed to have links to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Among the eight lawmakers who did not support the legislation were representatives from both the Democratic and Republican parties, known for their radical liberal or conservative views. The group included representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as well as Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas).</p>
<p>An identical bill bearing the same name was introduced in the Senate back in March.</p>
<p>The latest piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland said during a congressional hearing that he &ldquo;<em>would support legislation that would allow some of that money to go directly to Ukraine.</em>&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Supplies to Spain might be cut off, Algeria warns</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Algeria, which boasts Africa&rsquo;s second biggest gas reserves, has announced it will stop gas deliveries to Spain if energy is then transferred to a <em>&ldquo;third destination.&rdquo;</em> The warning follows a recent decision by Madrid&nbsp;to provide gas to the North African nation&rsquo;s neighbor and regional rival, Morocco.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Natural gas delivered to Spain, whose destination is none other than that provided for in the contracts, will be considered as a breach of contractual commitments,&rdquo;</em> the Algerian Energy Ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Such a move by Madrid <em>&ldquo;could result in the termination of the contract between Sonatrach and its Spanish customers,&rdquo;</em> it added.</p>
<p>Sonatrach is Algier&rsquo;s state-owned gas company, which supplied more than 40% of Madrid&rsquo;s natural gas imports in 2021.</p>
<p>The threat contradicts last week&rsquo;s statement by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who assured <em>&ldquo;the Spanish people that Algeria will never abandon its commitment to supply Spain with gas under any circumstances.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In March, Algiers recalled its ambassador from Madrid after Spain backed Morocco, Madrid&rsquo;s former colony, in its dispute with Algeria over Western Sahara.</p>
<p>Morocco sees Western Sahara as part of its own territory, and plans to give it autonomy, while Algeria is supporting the Polisario Front movement, which is pushing for independence for the area populated by more than half-a-million people.</p>
<p>The standoff between the neighbors saw Algiers severing diplomatic ties with Rabat last year. It also refused to prolong a deal to deliver gas to Spain via a pipeline that ran through Moroccan land and provided Rabat with most of its natural gas. Spanish customers now only get Algerian energy through an underwater pipeline.</p>

<p>In February, Madrid promised to help Rabat in this difficult situation and <em>&ldquo;guarantee its energy security.&rdquo;</em> And, earlier this week, the Spanish energy ministry confirmed plans to ship gas to Morocco.</p>
<p>However, it gave assurances that none of the gas received by Rabat will be of Algerian origin.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Morocco will be able to purchase LNG on the international markets, unload it at a regasification plant on the Spanish mainland and use the Maghreb gas pipeline to bring it to its territory,&rdquo;</em> the ministry explained.</p>
<p>Algeria is one of Africa&rsquo;s biggest gas exporters, with its supplies becoming increasingly important for Europe amid the Ukrainian conflict and Russia&rsquo;s demand for payments for its gas to be made in rubles, in response to sanctions and the freezing of its assets, which some EU nations have been reluctant to fulfill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>A senior minister has questioned the timing of Beijing’s security pact with the Solomon Islands</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Australia&rsquo;s home affairs minister has accused China of attempting to interfere in an election set for next month, saying a recent security deal with a nearby Pacific nation suggested nefarious motives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>In <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/australian-minister-accuses-china-of-election-interference-with-solomon-islands-pact/JXVEHGJL4RVSVG5JMPONAMERIY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a> to a Brisbane radio station on Wednesday, Karen Andrews warned that Australians ought to be <em>&ldquo;taking notice of and paying some attention to&rdquo;</em> China&rsquo;s pact with the Solomon Islands, announced last week.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Beijing is clearly very aware that we're in a federal election campaign here at the moment. Why now? Why, right in the middle of a federal election campaign is all this coming to light?&rdquo;</em> she asked, adding <em>&ldquo;We talk about political interference and that has many forms.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s unclear exactly what impact the China-Solomons deal would have on the May 21 federal election, the ruling Liberal Party has argued that Beijing is hoping to see victory for the opposition Labor Party, as the center-left faction takes up an increasingly hawkish line toward Beijing.</p>

<p>Labor issued a number of policy proposals earlier this week, including calls to train up soldiers in other Pacific countries and double security spending in the region. In unveiling the platform, party spokesperson Penny Wong blasted Prime Minister Scott Morrison for his supposed weakness on China, arguing that the Solomons deal occurred <em>&ldquo;on Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s watch&rdquo;</em> while warning of <em>&ldquo;the prospect of a Chinese base less than 2,000 kilometers from Australia&rsquo;s coastline.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Senior Labor lawmaker Jim Chalmers was dismissive of Andrews&rsquo; remarks, saying that, even by the <em>&ldquo;incredibly low standards of this government,&rdquo;</em> her criticism <em>&ldquo;was remarkably desperate and remarkably unhinged,"</em>&nbsp;adding that instead of the Chinese Communist Party, <em>&ldquo;the Australian people will determine who wins&rdquo;</em> next month&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>Much like the Labor spokeswoman, Andrews has also alleged that Beijing has plans to build a military facility in the Solomons. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin rejected that notion on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Some Australian politicians are used to seeking their own political gains by making denigrating remarks against China, and the international community has seen enough of this,&rdquo;</em> he <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202204/t20220427_10674583.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>. <em>&ldquo;Such statements cannot fool the international community or the Australian people.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>The billionaire entrepreneur quipped that he'll put the ‘coke’ back into Coca-Cola</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has joked that he will buy up the Coca-Cola Company after his high-profile purchase of Twitter, vowing to bring back an infamous &ndash; and now highly illegal &ndash; ingredient once contained in the drink.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Musk, who&rsquo;s known for his social media antics and trolling posts, took to Twitter late on Wednesday night to &lsquo;announce&rsquo; plans to buy the multi-billion dollar beverage corporation.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Next I&rsquo;m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in,&rdquo;</em> he said, playing on an <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519495982723084290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly popular meme</a> instigated by his $44-billion purchase of Twitter earlier this week.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next I’m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519480761749016577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>While the soft drink has long been one of America's&nbsp;most globally recognized cultural exports, its original formula contained some questionable ingredients, chief among them cocaine. According to <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/i-d-like-to-make-the-world-a-coke-attempting-the-original-coca-cola-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scientific American</a>, the soda still features an extract from coca leaves &ndash; from which the illicit white power is derived &ndash; but only after they have been <em>&ldquo;de-cocainized.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/07/25/fact-check-coke-once-contained-cocaine-but-likely-less-than-claimed/8008325002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unclear</a> exactly when the Coca-Cola company removed the drug from its products, though it was likely sometime after the firm was purchased from the drink&rsquo;s inventor, John Pemberton (himself a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inventor-of-coca-cola-was-a-morphine-addict-2013-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifelong morphine user</a>), in the late 1880s.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Musk&rsquo;s decision to buy Twitter outright has made waves in recent days, triggering cries of outrage from critics who believe the Tesla CEO will overhaul Twitter&rsquo;s more harsh content moderation policies against &lsquo;hate&rsquo; and &lsquo;disinformation.&rsquo; Supporters, meanwhile, have hailed his championing of online free speech, hoping he will bring political neutrality to a platform frequently accused of anti-conservative&nbsp;bias.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Amid backlash from detractors, Musk has since clarified that he defines <em>&ldquo;free speech&rdquo;</em> as whatever <em>&ldquo;matches the law,&rdquo;</em> appearing to walk back a previous statement that he is a &ldquo;free speech absolutist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect,&rdquo;</em> he said on Tuesday. <em>&ldquo;Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.&rdquo;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

We are at a low level right now.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>So if you're saying, 'Are we out of the pandemic phase in this country?' &mdash; we are.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong></strong>Nonetheless, Fauci cautioned that <em>&ldquo;we're not going to eradicate this virus,&rdquo;</em> but suggested it may be possible to keep infections at a <em>&ldquo;very low&rdquo;</em> level through intermittent vaccinations. He did not clarify how often new the new shots would be needed, however.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;That might be every year, that might be longer, in order to keep that level low. But, right now, we are not in the pandemic phase in this country,&rdquo;</em> Fauci continued, adding,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world, infection that spreads rapidly among people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Despite his rosier assessment while speaking with PBS, last month Fauci warned that new coronavirus variants emerging in the United States could force the country back under sweeping restrictions such as lockdowns, arguing that Americans could not simply say <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done. We&rsquo;re going to move on.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Congressionally mandated report on Afghanistan withdrawal tallies at least $7 billion in abandoned US military gear</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US forces left behind military equipment worth more than $7 billion during their chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last August, the Pentagon has reportedly revealed in a long-awaited declaration.</p>
<p>Washington gave Afghan government forces $18.6 billion of weaponry from 2005 to 2021, and $7.1 billion of that gear remained in the war-torn country after the US withdrawal on August 30, CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a> the Pentagon as saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The congressionally mandated report is yet another reminder of the severe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/us-left-78000-afghan-allies-ngo-report-rcna18119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losses</a> incurred during the chaotic US pull-out, which resulted in 13 troop deaths and the abandonment of thousands of American citizens and Afghan allies. Critics of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration have decried the Pentagon&rsquo;s failure to keep US weapons from falling into Taliban hands.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Nobody ever thought such stupidity as this feeble-brained withdrawal was possible,&rdquo;</em> said former President Donald Trump, who called for sending in troops to retrieve the equipment or bombing the gear to destroy it.</p>

<p>Some of the abandoned materiel, including 78 aircraft that were left at Kabul airport, was permanently disabled before US forces withdrew, the Pentagon report showed. More than $920 million worth of American planes remained in Afghanistan after Washington&rsquo;s exit, as did 40,000 military vehicles.</p>
<p>Also left behind were communications gear, more than 300,000 weapons and almost all of the 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment that had been given to Afghan government forces. Those pieces included radio systems, encryption devices, transmitters, night vision goggles, surveillance gear and <em>&ldquo;biometric and positioning equipment,&rdquo;</em> the Pentagon said. Most of the 9,524 air-to-ground munitions that were left behind were non-precision explosives.</p>
<p>Ukraine was the beneficiary of some supplies that had originally been earmarked for Afghanistan. The report showed that five Mi-17 helicopters were officially transferred to&nbsp;Kiev&nbsp;this year after previously being sent to the former Soviet republic for maintenance work. Other equipment shifted to Ukraine included 37,000 howitzer shells, as well as rifle ammunition, grenade cartridges and 119,000 82mm mortar rounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>British FM Liz Truss says a 'Global NATO' needs to arm Taiwan, like Ukraine</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The world order created after the Second World War and the Cold War isn&rsquo;t working anymore, so the West needs <em>&ldquo;a global NATO&rdquo;</em> to pursue geopolitics anew, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss argued, in a major foreign policy speech on Wednesday. Truss also urged the US-led bloc to send more&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;heavy weapons, tanks&rdquo;</em> and airplanes to Ukraine, and said China would face the same treatment as Russia if it doesn&rsquo;t <em>&ldquo;play by the rules.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My vision is a world where free nations are assertive and in the ascendant. Where freedom and democracy are strengthened through a network of economic and security partnerships,&rdquo;</em> Truss said in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-mansion-house-speech-at-the-lord-mayors-easter-banquet-the-return-of-geopolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech</a> at a Mansion House banquet in London.</p>
<p>Dubbing this arrangement <em>&ldquo;the Network of Liberty,&rdquo;</em> Truss argued it was necessary because the economic and security structures developed after 1945 &ndash; such as the UN Security Council &ndash; <em>&ldquo;have been bent out of shape so far, they have enabled rather than contained aggression.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Geopolitics is back,&rdquo;</em> she announced.</p>
<p>The collective West and its allies need to supply Kiev with <em>&ldquo;heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes &ndash; digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production,&rdquo;</em> Truss said, because the objective is to <em>&ldquo;push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine&rdquo;</em> and rebuild the country along the lines of a new Marshall Plan.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The war in Ukraine is our war &ndash; it is everyone&rsquo;s war because Ukraine&rsquo;s victory is a strategic imperative for all of us.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, NATO must ensure that <em>&ldquo;the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom,&rdquo;</em> and uphold the <em>&ldquo;sacrosanct&rdquo;</em> open-door policy, Truss said.</p>

<p>Her ambitions went beyond Europe, though, as Truss denounced the <em>&ldquo;false choice between Euro-Atlantic security and Indo-Pacific security.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the modern world we need both. We need a global NATO,&rdquo;</em> she said. <em>&ldquo;And we must ensure that democracies like Taiwan are able to defend themselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Pointing to London&rsquo;s unprecedented effort to embargo Russia, Truss insisted that <em>&ldquo;economic access is no longer a given. It has to be earned,&rdquo;</em> and that countries who wish to earn it <em>&ldquo;must play by the rules. And that includes China.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The UK has sent a large quantity of weapons systems to Ukraine over the past several months, including NLAW anti-tank missiles and Stormer armored vehicles. British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told Thames Radio on Wednesday it would be <em>&ldquo;completely legitimate&rdquo;</em> for Ukraine to use UK-supplied weapons to strike into Russian territory, to which the <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554557-uk-ukraine-strike-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russian military warned</a> that any such attack would be met with a proper response.</p>

<p>Truss traveled to Russia in early February to threaten Moscow not to invade Ukraine, but ended up being widely mocked after multiple gaffes concerning geography. She first <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/548225-uk-foreign-minister-geography-gaffe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mistook</a> the Baltic for the Black Sea in a BBC interview, then reportedly <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/548949-truss-recognize-sovereignty-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fell for a trick question</a> from her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and insisted London would <em>&ldquo;never recognize Russia&rsquo;s sovereignty&rdquo;</em> over Rostov and Voronezh &ndash; Russian regions she mistook for the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>Starting her cabinet career as under-secretary for education and childcare in 2012, she has since held the environmental affairs, justice, treasury, and international trade portfolios, before replacing Dominic Raab as head of the Foreign Office in September 2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Fake legal requests used to obtain personal data and scandalous material is then weaponized against minors</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>A handful of Big Tech firms have been conned into turning over user data in response to phony law enforcement requests &ndash; data that is then used to extort and sexually harass those users, several informed sources told Bloomberg on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Companies including Google, Apple, Meta, Twitter, Snap, and Discord have been duped into supplying user data to malicious actors who then use the information to extort their victims, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-duped-giving-data-173424811.html">sources</a> claim. The fake law-enforcement officers reportedly target specific women and minors, sometimes coercing them into creating and sharing sexually explicit material by using threats of retaliation.</p>
<p><strong></strong>While these scams initially appeared to focus on financially extorting their victims, sexual extortion schemes have become disturbingly popular, according to Bloomberg&rsquo;s law enforcement sources. They typically begin with a hacker compromising a law enforcement agency&rsquo;s email system and forging an <em>&ldquo;emergency data request&rdquo;</em> targeting a particular social media user. When the company provides the requested information, the hacker can use it to compromise the target&rsquo;s social media accounts outright or befriend them over a period of time, eventually coercing or blackmailing them into providing sexually explicit photos or videos.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Victims who don&rsquo;t cooperate are subject to an array of retaliation tactics including <em>&ldquo;swatting,&rdquo;</em> a potentially deadly prank that involves calling in a fake threat to a local 911 dispatcher. Police sent to the target&rsquo;s home may be told the individual is violent, leading to potentially <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/swatting-sentence-casey-viner/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deadly</a> confrontations. Others may have their personal information posted to dedicated doxxing websites, inviting random miscreants to torment them at will. Those duped into providing sexually explicit material are told the offending photos will be sent to family members, friends or employers.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Because emergency requests don&rsquo;t require a court order signed by a judge, they are relatively easy to manufacture, and the social media companies themselves are not required to fork over the data. However, most supply the information anyway, especially if the request references a situation of <em>&ldquo;imminent danger&rdquo;</em> such as kidnapping, suicide or murder.</p>
<p>Companies willingly turn over the names, IP addresses, emails, physical addresses, and sometimes even more information in response to such requests &ndash; often responding in the same way as they would to a court-ordered subpoena. And in some cases, the fake requests do come accompanied by a judge&rsquo;s forged signature, which can reportedly be purchased for as little as $10 on the dark web.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos called for police departments and tech firms to step up their security, requiring confirmation callbacks and multi-factor authentication to make it more difficult to spoof calls or emails from the authorities.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Spokespeople from Facebook, Google, Discord and Snap insisted that they work with law enforcement to <em>&ldquo;validate&rdquo;</em> legitimate data requests, while Twitter and Apple declined to comment on the matter. When requested, the companies provide the desired data in the vast majority of cases, even without a court order. Apple reportedly complies with 93% of emergency requests, while Meta allegedly supplies data in response to 77% of inquiries.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Reports of hackers and other criminals conning Big Tech firms into supplying user information initially surfaced last year, with at least one of the culprits &ndash; a teenager &ndash; linked to British cybercrime ring Lapsus$, a group with a history of allegedly hacking Microsoft, Samsung and Nvidia. While many if not most of the perpetrators are believed to be minors, this should not put law enforcement off prosecuting them to the fullest extent of the law, according to Allison Nixon, chief research officer at cybersecurity firm Unit 221b. <em>&ldquo;We are now witnessing their transition to organized crime, and all the real-world violence and sexual abuse that comes with it,&rdquo;</em> she said, urging authorities to try these <em>&ldquo;serious&rdquo;</em> offenders as adults.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Washington offers to expand the information it shares with Kiev</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has reportedly lifted more&nbsp;restrictions on intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, sources told Bloomberg on Wednesday, adding that the expanded access is aimed at helping Kiev seize the breakaway republics in Donbass.</p>

<p>Turner has long criticized the administration&rsquo;s backing of Ukraine as insufficiently forceful, <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2022/03/16/influential-ohio-republicans-call-biden-do-more-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arguing</a> for more weapons to be sent to Kiev by claiming this would somehow prevent an &ldquo;<em>actual direct conflict</em>&rdquo; between the US and Russia. However, Moscow has called for the US and Europe to stop arming Ukraine, claiming that the growing pile of arms sent Kiev&rsquo;s way amounts to a <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/554602-ukraine-us-eu-arms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy war</a> against Russia.</p>
<p>Republicans from the Senate Intelligence Committee had previously <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2022/04/14/pressure-on-us-to-give-ukraine-more-intelligence-on-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged</a> Haines to &ldquo;<em>proactively share intelligence with the Ukrainians to help them protect, defend, and retake every inch of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereign territory</em>&rdquo; &ndash; a category, they argued, that includes the Crimea peninsula and the Lugansk and Donetsk republics of Donbass.</p>
<p>Last week, the US reportedly <a href="https://www.messengernews.net/wire/?ID=185653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifted</a> some of its geographic limits on transferring &ldquo;<em>actionable information</em>,&rdquo; of the sort used in making split-second decisions on the field of battle, allegedly removing language related to specific locations in eastern Ukraine. However, the directive continues to limit information regarding military forces and potential targets across the border in Russia or Belarus.</p>
<p>The White House has previously held back on sharing such information &ldquo;<em>because that steps over the line to making us participating in the war</em>,&rdquo; Congressman Adam Smith (D-Washington), who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said last month. The administration has also refused to give Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the no-fly zone he initially demanded, viewing it as an escalation that would directly involve the US and NATO in the war.</p>

<p>However, some members of Congress have been more hawkish in their approach. Turner made a point last month of asking the NATO commander for Europe, General Tod Wolters, if he was &ldquo;<em>satisfied</em>&rdquo; with the speed at which information was reaching Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Move comes days after Elon Musk struck deal to buy Twitter and pledged to restore freedom of speech on social media</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration is expanding the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s (DHS) purview to include fighting speech that the government deems to be <em>&ldquo;disinformation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Plans for the new initiative were revealed on Wednesday, when DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas said in a congressional hearing that his department had created a <em>&ldquo;disinformation governance board.&rdquo;</em> The new body will be headed by Nina Jankowicz, whose resume includes advising the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and overseeing the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute lobby group.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s out of the bag,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/harrysiegel/status/1519309674381721601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jankowicz</a> said in a Twitter post. <em>&ldquo;Here's what I've been up to the past two months, and why I&rsquo;ve been a bit quiet on here.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Although Mayorkas unveiled the new entity in response to a question about disinformation being used to sway elections, the new board will reportedly focus on countering <em>&ldquo;misinformation related to homeland security, focused specifically on irregular migration and Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The administration announced its disinformation push just two days after billionaire Elon Musk reached an agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Musk has vowed to restore freedom of speech on the platform, which has banned prominent conservative voices and was accused of influencing the 2020 presidential election by suppressing news on an alleged Biden influence-peddling scandal.</p>
<p>White House press secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeBeacon/status/1518684297741414400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jen Psaki</a>, who was questioned about the Twitter deal by reporters on Monday, said Biden <em>&ldquo;has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms&rdquo;</em> and will urge Congress to take steps to help combat online misinformation.</p>

<p>Ironically, Jankowicz promoted <a href="https://twitter.com/wiczipedia/status/1319463138107031553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">false information</a> about the alleged Biden scandal weeks before the 2020 election, saying the New York Post&rsquo;s suppressed story had been branded a <em>&ldquo;Russian influence op&rdquo;</em> by former intelligence officials. She also called the report a <em>&ldquo;Trump campaign product&rdquo;</em> and warned that supporters of President Donald Trump would show up at the polls with weapons to intimidate voters. The emails on which the Biden story was based were later verified by other major media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Responding to news of Musk&rsquo;s Twitter takeover on Monday, Jankowicz said, <em>&ldquo;I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities, which are already shouldering disproportionate amounts of this abuse.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: DHS is officially launching its own Ministry of Truth, or the so-called &quot;Disinformation Governance Board.&quot;<br><br>Nina Jankowicz will head the board as executive director. &quot;Free speech absolutists&quot; make her &quot;shudder,&quot; so everything should be fine. <a href="https://t.co/wVc7hEBX11">pic.twitter.com/wVc7hEBX11</a></p>&mdash; Young Americans for Liberty (@YALiberty) <a href="https://twitter.com/YALiberty/status/1519414533567270912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Last December, Jankowicz called Musk an <em>&ldquo;online abuser&rdquo;</em> and said the best antidote to such behavior is <em>&ldquo;to deny them influence and notoriety.&rdquo;</em> She also has defended regulation of speech, saying, <em>&ldquo;The &lsquo;free speech vs censorship&rsquo; framing is a false dichotomy.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>While welcoming Beijing’s defense minister, Tehran called for a strategic partnership to create order and stability</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Iran sees its relations with China as part of an effort by like-minded powers to confront US unilateralism and create stability and order, President Ebrahim Raisi told Beijing's visiting Defense Minister Wei Fenghe on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Raisi said that the successful implementation of the 25-year strategic cooperation agreement between the two countries, signed in 2021, was a priority for Tehran, according to state media.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Confronting unilateralism and creating stability and order is possible through the cooperation of independent and like-minded powers,&rdquo;</em> Raisi was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency. He added that the current <em>&ldquo;regional and global developments show more than ever the value of Iran-China strategic cooperation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Wei said his visit was aimed at <em>&ldquo;improving the strategic defense cooperation&rdquo;</em> between Tehran and Beijing, which would have a <em>&ldquo;remarkable&rdquo;</em> impact on fighting terrorism and defusing unilateralism, <em>&ldquo;particularly in the current critical and tense situation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Wei also met with Iranian Defense Minister General Mohammed Reza Ashtiani and reportedly invited him to visit China. In their meeting, Ashtiani stressed <em>&ldquo;the need to counter American hegemony in the world by strengthening multilateralism,&rdquo;</em> according to a statement by the Iranian Defense Ministry.</p>
<p><strong></strong>Ashtiani also criticized the US military presence in the Middle East and elsewhere, saying that <em>&ldquo;wherever the US has had military presence, it has created waves of insecurity, instability, rifts, pessimism, war, destruction and displacement,&rdquo;</em> according to IRNA.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Major General Mohammed Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran&rsquo;s armed forces, also met with the Chinese visitor, and offered some details on the shape of their cooperation going forward.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;We agreed to expand bilateral cooperation in joint military drills, exchange of strategies, training issues and other common fields between the two countries&rsquo; armed forces so that we can provide better security for the two countries,&rdquo;</em> Bagheri told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong></strong>The 2021 strategic cooperation treaty has paved the way to military cooperation between Iran and China, but also a variety of economic activities ranging from oil trade to transportation and agriculture.</p>
<p>Iran has been under unilateral US sanctions since 2018, when the Trump administration reneged on the 2015 nuclear deal. China is one of the signatories of the original pact, along with the UK, France, Germany, and Russia. The current US government has said it wants to restore the agreement, but the talks have gone nowhere due to Washington&rsquo;s refusal to lift the sanctions against Tehran.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>US president memorializes former secretary of state as a ‘force for good in the world’</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>President Joe Biden has eulogized America&rsquo;s first female secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, as a <em>&ldquo;force for good in the world&rdquo;</em> who <em>&ldquo;turned the tide of history&rdquo;</em> with her <em>&ldquo;goodness and grace, her humanity and her intellect.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world,&rdquo;</em> Biden said on Wednesday at a memorial service for Albright in Washington. The Czech-born diplomat, who served as secretary of state under then-President Bill Clinton, died from cancer last month at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Albright was praised following news of her death by well-wishers, including globalist activist George Soros, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former UK premier Tony Blair, and former presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Biden offered similar sentiments on Wednesday.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a> shares a story of speaking in Poland soon after the passing of Sec.

<p></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;To Madeleine, from my perspective, there was no higher mission, no greater honor, than to serve this great experiment in freedom known as the United States of America,&rdquo;</em> the president said. <em>&ldquo;May her memory continue to be a blessing to our nation, and may we remember her words and her deeds.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>However, not all the remembrances of those words and deeds were positive.</p>
<p>Critics, such as radio host Michael Savage and author Mike Cernovich, have called her a <em>&ldquo;war criminal.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Albright infamously claimed in a 1996 CBS News interview that the deaths of an estimated 500,000 Iraqi children resulting from US sanctions were <em>&ldquo;worth it.&rdquo;</em> She championed NATO&rsquo;s 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999 and referred to pro-Serbian activists at a 2012 book-signing in Prague as <em>&ldquo;disgusting Serbs.&rdquo;</em> She was later accused of war-profiteering, when a media report revealed that her investment firm was bidding for the proposed privatization of Kosovo&rsquo;s telecommunications and postal services.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Biden praised Albright for helping to strengthen and galvanize NATO. He added that Albright mentored generations of young people, helping to create America&rsquo;s current <em>&ldquo;foreign policy establishment.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;She loved to speak about America as the &lsquo;indispensable nation&rsquo;,&rdquo;</em> Biden said. <em>&ldquo;To her, the phrase was never a statement of arrogance. It was about gratitude for all this country made possible for her. It was a testament to her belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock around the world and to her understanding of what American power could achieve when it was united with and motivated by enduring American values.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Biden also praised Albright as a diplomat who understood and cared about people, and he credited her with ensuring that <em>&ldquo;young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, while campaigning for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, Albright chastised women who didn&rsquo;t agree with her politics, saying, <em>&ldquo;Just remember, there&rsquo;s a special place in hell for women who don&rsquo;t help each other.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>Facebook has acknowledged that even its own privacy engineers struggle to understand how users&rsquo; personal data is processed and stored in a recently-leaked document published by news outlet Motherboard on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;ve built systems with open borders</em>,&rdquo; the document, apparently written by privacy engineers working on the Ad and Business Product team, laments, likening the platform&rsquo;s data management systems to a &ldquo;<em>bottle of ink</em>&rdquo; comprised of different kinds of user information. &ldquo;<em>You pour that ink into a lake of water (our open data systems; our open culture) &hellip; and it flows &hellip; everywhere</em>,&rdquo; the team explains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>How do you put that ink back in the bottle? How do you organize it again, such that it only flows to the allowed places in the lake?</em>&rdquo; the team asked, describing the conundrum as a &ldquo;<em>fundamental</em>&rdquo; problem for Facebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We can&rsquo;t confidently make controlled policy changes or external commitments such as &lsquo;we will not use X data for Y purpose&rsquo;. And yet, this is exactly what regulators expect us to do</em>,&rdquo; the document, written in 2021, continues. The model is supposed to sit &ldquo;<em>at the center of [Facebook&rsquo;s] monetization strategy and [act as] the engine that powers Facebook&rsquo;s growth</em>,&rdquo; yet the company&rsquo;s own employees clearly struggle to understand the basic concepts underpinning that strategy.</p>
<p>The issue, referred to as &ldquo;<em>data lineage</em>,&rdquo; is at the core of recent legal developments in multiple countries regarding how social media data is used. If Facebook collects a user&rsquo;s phone number for the stated purpose of securing the individual&rsquo;s account with two-factor authentication, for example, it is illegal to feed it to the platform&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>people you may know</em>&rdquo; feature under the EU&rsquo;s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation law. Tech blog Gizmodo caught Facebook doing just that shortly after the law was passed, and the platform had to stop the practice.</p>
<p>As governments &ndash; including the EU, India, and the US &ndash; pass increasingly stringent regulations aimed at controlling speech on social media, the inability of Facebook employees to manage or even understand how their platforms handle user data is becoming an increasingly serious issue.</p>
<p>The leaked document obtained by Motherboard suggests employees may not even be able to limit the use of individuals&rsquo; data, due to the sheer volume of information collected on a daily basis.</p>
<p>While a Facebook spokesperson denied the document constituted evidence it was not complying with privacy regulations, an employee who spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity argued that, if anything, the paper&rsquo;s condemnation of Facebook&rsquo;s cluelessness didn&rsquo;t go far enough. &ldquo;<em>Facebook has a general idea of how many bits of data are stored in its data centers. The where [the data] goes part is, broadly speaking, a complete s***show</em>,&rdquo; the employee told Vice in an online chat, suggesting it gave Facebook &ldquo;<em>legal cover</em>&rdquo; because of how much it would cost the company to &ldquo;<em>fix this mess</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It gives them the excuse for keeping that much private data simply because at their scale and with their business model and infrastructure design they can plausibly claim that they don&rsquo;t know what they have</em>,&rdquo; the employee explained.</p>

<p>Privacy activist and senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties Johnny Ryan told Motherboard that the document &ldquo;<em>admits what we long suspected: that there is a data free-for-all inside Facebook, and that the company has no control whatsoever over the data it holds.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is a black and white recognition of the absence of any data protection. Facebook details how it breaks each principle of data protection law. Everything it does to our data is illegal. You&rsquo;re not allowed to have an internal data free-for-all</em>,&rdquo; Ryan insisted.</p>
<p>The document warns that a &ldquo;<em>multi-year investment in Ads and our infrastructure teams</em>&rdquo; will be required in order to &ldquo;<em>gain control over how our systems ingest, process and egest data</em>&rdquo; in order to bring the platform into compliance with the current regulatory climate, warning that restrictions on the use of individuals&rsquo; private data &ldquo;<em>will continue to expand around the globe as we shift toward consent.</em>&rdquo;</p>

                            <p><strong>Stockholm seeking cash for combat supplies it sent to Ukraine, local media reports</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Sweden is seeking compensation from the European Union for the military equipment it has sent to Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia, Swedish Radio reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stockholm approved sending military supplies to Ukraine over the past two months. Late in February, it greenlit the delivery of some 135,000 field rations, 5,000 helmets, and 5,000 pieces of body armor, as well as some 5,000 shoulder-fired anti-tank Pansarskott 86 grenade launchers.</p>
<p>Late in March, the country approved the delivery of a further 5,000 anti-tank weapons, as well as de-mining kits. The two batches had an estimated cost of 413 million kroner ($43.5 million) and 205 million kroner ($21.7 million), respectively.</p>

<p>The country is now seeking compensation from the European Union for its deliveries, requesting 95 million kroner ($10 million) for the batch of 5,000 helmets alone, the outlet reported, noting that the sum is significantly larger than the actual cost of the <em>&ldquo;old&rdquo;</em> equipment. Still, Stockholm is unlikely to profit from the Ukraine deliveries should it actually succeed in receiving compensation from the EU. Instead, supporting Kiev is likely to incur costs, the radio station suggested.</p>
<p>Multiple European countries &ndash; as well as the United States &ndash; have pledged their support for Kiev amid its standoff with Moscow, sending in weaponry and assorted equipment to prop up Ukrainian forces. Some Western leaders &ndash; such as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell &ndash; have openly stated that they wanted Russia to <em>&ldquo;be defeated&rdquo;</em> by Ukraine on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Moscow has urged Western nations against <em>&ldquo;pumping&rdquo;</em> Ukraine with weaponry, warning that it would only prolong the conflict and inflict further damage on Ukraine and its people.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The US agency’s chief has complained that Beijing isn’t cooperating with Washington on space ventures</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>NASA chief Bill Nelson has scolded the Chinese space program for refusing to work with the US on its operations, saying Beijing&rsquo;s secrecy has created unnecessary risks.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We simply have not been able to get any kind of transparency from the Chinese space program,&rdquo;</em> Nelson told reporters on Tuesday. He made his comments in a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?519737-1/nasa-administrator-briefing-crew-4-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press briefing</a> ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s successful SpaceX launch of a rocket carrying a new astronaut crew to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Nelson has warned of an emerging space race with China and has frequently called for the Chinese space program to collaborate with NASA. Lamenting on Tuesday that no such cooperation from Beijing has been forthcoming, he gave the example of an April 2021 incident in which Chinese space officials declined to share tracking data with the US or other countries as a rocket booster careened back toward earth after carrying a space station module into orbit.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t reserve enough fuel to have a controlled re-entry, and thank the Good Lord it came down in the Indian Ocean,&rdquo;</em> Nelson recalled. <em>&ldquo;But it could have come down in Europe, it could have come down in Saudi Arabia, it could have come down in Greece.&rdquo;</em> He added that NASA engineers were forced to make their own calculations of the booster&rsquo;s track back toward Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We want cooperation with the Chinese, but it takes two to tango.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of such transparency, Nelson said NASA <em>&ldquo;will deal with it as it progresses.&rdquo;</em> However, he has previously <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-work-china-1632508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged</a> that NASA abides by a 2011 law that prohibits the agency from engaging in direct collaboration with the Chinese government or any China-affiliated organizations without explicit approval from Congress and federal law enforcement authorities. Chinese officials have pointed to that ban, called the Wolf Amendment, as &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; and an impediment to direct cooperation with NASA.</p>

<p>China isn&rsquo;t a member of the International Space Station (ISS) program. NASA has called for keeping the ISS in operation, continuing its partnership with Russia, until 2030. The current ISS agreement between NASA and Roscosmos runs through 2024.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Nelson said NASA had <em>&ldquo;the Good Housekeeping seal of approval from the White House&rdquo;</em> to extend the collaboration to 2030, despite rising geopolitical tensions over Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. He pointed to past collaborations with Moscow, starting with the Apollo-Soyuz docking in 1975, and the enduring friendships that have been formed.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Despite the horrors that we are seeing with our eyes daily on television of what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine as a result of political decisions that are being made by the president of Russia, despite all of that, despite a war going on in Ukraine, I see that professional relationship with astronauts and cosmonauts and the ground teams in the two respective mission controls, I see that continuing,&rdquo;</em> Nelson said.</p>

<p>A US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) <a href="https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/2997352/challenges-mount-against-us-allies-in-race-to-maintain-stability-in-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> released earlier this month suggested that China and Russia aim to <em>&ldquo;undercut US and allied global leadership in the space domain.&rdquo;</em> Both countries are expanding their military capabilities in space and view the domain as key to winning modern wars, the DIA said. China may plan to use space-based technology to block US radars and jam sophisticated weapons systems, the report added.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) last month suspended a Mars mission with Russia and halted cooperation with Moscow. Speaking at Tuesday&rsquo;s NASA press briefing, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said his 28-nation group may undertake the ExoMars rover mission on its own or seek another partner, such as NASA, in lieu of working with Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What I want to get out of this crisis is really to make sure that we build up a robust space industry and space infrastructure &ndash; robust in the sense that we are hedging our missions and our activities against this type of thing,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

                            <p><strong>The justice ministers of Denmark and Kosovo have signed a treaty, with Copenhagen renting 300 prison cells from Pristina</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Denmark will be sending foreign nationals convicted in the country to serve their sentences in a Kosovan prison, the countries&rsquo; respective justice ministers agreed on Wednesday. Should both sides' parliaments give the accord the green light, the first inmates could be transferred to the Balkans as early as next year.</p>
<p>Danish Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup and his Kosovan colleague Albulena Haxhiu have signed off on a deal that reserves some 300 cells in a Kosovan prison for Danish migrant convicts. According to the scheme, inmates who are not Danish nationals will be serving sentences meted out by Danish courts in a prison located in the Kosovan city of Gjilan. The penitentiary facility will, however, first have to be refurbished so that conditions in there are in line with those found in Danish jails.</p>
<p>After the inmates have served their time, they will be deported back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>The accord signed on Wednesday was preceded by a preliminary agreement between Copenhagen and Pristina in December 2021. The BBC reported at the time that Denmark would shell out &euro;15 million annually for an initial period of five years. On top of that, Copenhagen will reportedly help Pristina develop green energy in the Balkan region in exchange.</p>
<p>The Danish justice minister hailed the deal as <em>&ldquo;ground-breaking,&rdquo;</em> adding that it would help the kingdom better manage its own <em>&ldquo;overcrowded prisons and will ease the pressure on our prison officers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Haekkerup also noted that the agreement <em>&ldquo;sends a clear signal to foreigners from third-party countries who have been sentenced to deportation&rdquo;</em> that their<em> &ldquo;future is not in Denmark and therefore you won't serve your sentence here.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Commenting on the news to Denmark&rsquo;s Ritzau media outlet, the official expressed hope that the <em>&ldquo;practical side of things can be ready in the first quarter of 2023.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>According to official data cited by the media, the number of inmates in Denmark has ballooned by almost 20% since 2015, reaching over 4,000 in early 2021, and the Scandinavian country&rsquo;s prison system has been operating at capacity.</p>
<p>The deal struck between Denmark and Kosovo comes weeks after the UK government revealed plans to send asylum seekers arriving in that country to Rwanda, where they would await as their applications are processed by British authorities. The Times reported at the time that only male migrants would be flown to the central African nation.</p>
<p>In early April, British Home Secretary Priti Patel traveled to the African country which had finalized a <em>&ldquo;migration and economic development partnership&rdquo;</em> with the UK. It followed previous failed attempts to strike similar deals with Albania and Ghana.</p>
<p>It is, however, not clear at this point if the holding facilities in Rwanda will be under UK jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Labour opposition slammed the scheme as an <em>&ldquo;unworkable, unethical and extortionate policy that would cost the UK taxpayer billions of pounds during a cost of living crisis and would make it harder, not easier, to get fast and fair asylum decisions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, too, expressed concern over London&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>In 2020, Human Rights Watch issued a report claiming that detainees in Rwanda suffer from arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial facilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>British authorities disregarded the risk of placing elderly patients in care homes, according to the judges</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>British health authorities violated the law by overlooking the risk of placing untested elderly patients into care homes in the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the High Court ruled on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two women - Cathy Gardner and Fay Harris, who lost their fathers to the virus in early 2020 &ndash; sued the then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Public Health England over how the initial outbreak of Covid-19 had been handled.</p>
<p>Despite rejecting their other claims, the judges sided with the complainants, who questioned the government&rsquo;s directives on the use of care homes at the start of the outbreak in the UK.</p>
<p>Last month, the lawyer who represents Gardner and Harris said that those orders had contributed to the death of some 20,000 patients in England and Wales between March and June 2020.<em> &ldquo;Put together, the various policies were a recipe for disaster and disaster is what happened,&rdquo;</em> he explained.</p>

<p>In their ruling on Wednesday, Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham concluded that the documents issued by the health authorities in March and early April 2020 were unlawful and <em>&ldquo;irrational&rdquo;</em> for having failed to take into account the danger of non-symptomatic transmission of the virus to elderly and vulnerable people.</p>
<p>There was already <em>&ldquo;growing awareness&rdquo;</em> about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus at that time, but there was no evidence of Hancock addressing such risks when it came to the wards of care homes in any way, according to the judges.</p>
<p>The government could&rsquo;ve told asymptomatic patients to quarantine for 14 days to avoid further spread of the virus, they pointed out.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t done as the<em> &ldquo;drafters of the documents of March 17 and April 2 simply failed to take into account the highly relevant consideration of the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from asymptomatic transmission,&rdquo;</em> the ruling read.</p>
<p>The judges said that the health authorities only addressed the issue of non-symptomatic transmission mid-April 2020.</p>
<p>Hancock's spokesman reacted to the ruling by saying that the then-health secretary had acted reasonably, but Public Health England had <em>&ldquo;failed to tell ministers what they knew about asymptomatic transmission"</em> of the coronavirus.</p>

                            <p><strong>The re-elected president’s second term risks being as plagued by protest as his first one</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron sailed to a re-election victory on April 24 with 58.5% of the <a href="https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2022/FE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vote</a> over populist challenger Marine Le Pen&rsquo;s 41.4%.&nbsp;But his mandate to govern France has taken a hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a voting day Ipsos Sopra Steria <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/amp/politique/presidentielle-42-des-electeurs-d-emmanuel-macron-ont-vote-pour-lui-pour-faire-barrage-a-marine-le-pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a>, 42% of second-round voters who ultimately chose Macron, only did so to block Le Pen &ndash; routinely portrayed as dangerously far-right in the mainstream French press &ndash; and not because they overtly support Macron and his program.&nbsp;The president even acknowledged this phenomenon in his <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/elections/presidentielle/presidentielle-2022-ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-du-discours-de-victoire-d-emmanuel-macron-09dc308e-c403-11ec-986e-afb59ec73cac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">victory speech</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The math therefore suggests that Macron&rsquo;s actual support among the French who bothered to vote in the final round (with a 53-year record high of 28% of them choosing not to) was only about 41%. Hardly the resounding victory portrayed in the fawning praise of European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. <em>&ldquo;Together, we will <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1518292235632132101?s=21&amp;t=_A6JPf3hr4SCEJWLvkR9iw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move</a> France and Europe forward,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said the bureaucrat, who was elected by even fewer French than Macron (that is, zero).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-breathe-sigh-of-relief-at-emmanuel-macron-france-re-election/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Various</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ottawa.citynews.ca/national-business/to-europes-relief-frances-macron-wins-but-far-right-gains-5294556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media</a>&nbsp;outlets referred to other European leaders breathing a sigh of relief that Macron remained at the helm of one of the leading European nations &ndash; namely German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But while the post-victory kudos were rolling in, the American Embassy in France had already prepared a much less optimistic message, ahead of the final vote, warning its citizens in France to <em>&ldquo;expect spontaneous gatherings in cities throughout France after 8pm&rdquo;</em> which <em>&ldquo;could potentially <a href="https://fr.usembassy.gov/demonstration-and-security-alert-u-s-embassy-paris-france-april-22-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn</a> violent.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Indeed, protesters upset with the result &ndash; if not with the lack of ballot choice &ndash; <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/ni-macron-ni-le-pen-plusieurs-manifestations-en-france-apres-l-annonce-du-resultat-de-la-presidentielle_5100493.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit</a> several French cities on election night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macron&rsquo;s second term risks being dominated by the same street opposition that plagued his first term, when he incrementally but surely aligned France with an agenda friendly to global financial interests &ndash; including big pharma vaccine mandates, big-tech digital green passes, and climate-change-backed wealth redistribution, away from the working class.</p>
<p>The sociological details of the final-round voting speak volumes.</p>
<p>Among voters who earn less than &euro;1,250 per month, 56% of them voted for Le Pen over Macron, according to the Ipsos Sopra Steria <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/politique/second-tour-de-la-presidentielle-quel-est-le-profil-des-electeurs-203616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll</a>.&nbsp;Another survey, by Harris Interactive, <a href="http://harris-interactive.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Sociologie_du_vote-24042022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that 77% of the executive or management class chose Macron, while 67% of blue-collar workers and 57% of employees favored Le Pen.</p>
<p>Macron also benefited overwhelmingly from the backing of 72% of voters over age 65, according to the survey. And 76% of the far left&rsquo;s second-round voters turned to Macron, undoubtedly to block Le Pen and just as their leader, Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon of the France Unbowed party, had requested.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there was an <a href="http://harris-interactive.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Sociologie_du_vote-24042022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11%</a>&nbsp;shift in expressed votes from Macron to Le Pen among young people aged 18-24 years compared with the 2017 Macron-Le Pen matchup, no doubt a sign of disappointment with the establishment status quo, despite being tempered by the far-left&rsquo;s unwillingness to prioritize reining in the establishment over right/left ideology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this adds up to increased division among socio-economic classes and age groups. But a new, striking phenomenon has also <a href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/carte/284918-carte-resultats-du-second-tour-de-lelection-presidentielle-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerged</a>.&nbsp;The French overseas territories and &lsquo;d&eacute;partments&rsquo; voted overwhelmingly for Le Pen &ndash; including the French d&eacute;partment of Mayotte, which has the highest Muslim population in the country. A whopping 59% chose Le Pen, despite being frequently portrayed in the press as anti-Muslim due to her desire for immigration reform and her defense of secularism.</p>
<p>And in Guadeloupe, whose population famously resisted Covid mandates and restrictions (and which Le Pen opposes), the National Rally candidate bested Macron, with 70% of the vote. In Martinique where, like Guadeloupe, many citizens in the Caribbean never forgot how Paris lied to them about the dangers of the carcinogen chlordecone, used on their banana plantations from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50144261.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1972 to 1993</a>,&nbsp;and therefore harbor a similar <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/international/caraibes/2021-11-26/martinique/report-de-l-obligation-vaccinale-des-soignants-a-l-origine-de-la-crise.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distrust</a> of the Covid-19 jab,&nbsp;Le Pen walked away with 61% of the vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up, Macron risks running into trouble holding his current large majority in the French National Assembly, which has allowed him to ram through virtually any law that he wants. Longstanding tradition suggests that French voters will now use the upcoming legislative elections in June to recalibrate the balance of power away from Macron.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The buzz among the French chattering class is that Macron will have no choice now but to draw lessons from the presidential vote and temper his ambitions accordingly, lest he spend the next five years dealing with the majority of French who didn&rsquo;t vote for his program.&nbsp;But relying, post-electorally, on Macron showing some kind of potential future goodwill and benevolence, and prioritizing the interests of average citizens over those of establishment elites, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the best game plan. And if he doesn&rsquo;t, expect the rise of anti-establishment populism to continue.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The swap occurred on Wednesday as a result of a long negotiation process, the Russian Foreign Ministry says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>US national Trevor Reed, sentenced to nine years' jail in Russia in 2020, has been exchanged for&nbsp;pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been serving a 20-year sentence in a US prison since 2010, the&nbsp;Foreign Ministry, in Moscow, announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Diplomats told journalists that the swap was the result of a &ldquo;<em>lengthy negotiation process.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The exchange, which took place in Turkey, looked like a scene from a spy movie, Trevor&rsquo;s father, Joey Reed, told US media.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;He said it was like a movie &ndash; they walked past each other like in a spy swap,&rdquo;</em> Joey Reed said. <em>&ldquo;Our understanding is the next time Trevor steps off the plane he will be in America.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?19" data-telegram-post="rian_ru/160681" data-width="100%"></script>
    

<p>US President Joe Biden said that the &ldquo;<em>negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions</em>&rdquo; which he does &ldquo;<em>not take lightly</em>.&rdquo; In a White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/27/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-return-of-trevor-reed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released on Wednesday he also stressed that his government would continue its efforts to bring home other American nationals imprisoned in Russia.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1519290717679534080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that Washington was grateful to its &ldquo;<em>partners for their cooperation</em>,&rdquo; which helped the swap to take place.</p>
<p>An unnamed US official told a CBS News journalist that the prisoner exchange between Washington and Moscow was not a sign of broader diplomatic engagement with Russia amid its military campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old American national, who previously served in the US Marine Corps, was detained on August 16, 2019 in Moscow for drunk and disorderly behavior in a public place. According to Russian authorities, Reed resisted arrest and assaulted two officers while in a police car.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2020, a court in Moscow found the US national guilty of endangering the &ldquo;<em>life and health</em>&rdquo; of law enforcement personnel, and sentenced him to nine years behind bars.</p>

<p>Reed professed his innocence throughout the trial, and during his time in prison insisted that he had no recollection of the events of that day as he was drunk at the time. While behind bars, the former US marine allegedly went on a hunger strike twice and claimed he had sustained injuries while incarcerated.</p>
<p>His parents, who met with US President Joe Biden in late March, claimed Reed had contracted tuberculosis while incarcerated. Russia&rsquo;s Federal Penitentiary Service, however, denied he had contracted TB, describing his health as "<em>satisfactory</em>".</p>
<p>In the case of Konstantin Yaroshenko, 53, Russia had sought his return for years. He was detained in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia in West Africa on May 28, 2010. The Russian pilot was accused of preparing to ship several large hauls of cocaine to West Africa, which were then allegedly supposed to be split in smaller batches and delivered to New York. He was handed over to US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents days later, and then secretly moved to the US in violation of international law.</p>
<p>On September 7, 2011, a court in New York found Yaroshenko guilty of &ldquo;<em>conspiring to import cocaine into the United States</em>,&rdquo; and sentenced him to 20 years in jail.</p>
<p>Russian authorities maintained his innocence and repeatedly complained about the harsh conditions and lack of medical care he was subjected to in the US prison.</p>
<p>During his trial, Yaroshenko pointed out that US authorities had failed to present ironclad evidence to convict him. Moreover, the pilot claimed that he had been tortured by Liberian security services at the behest of DEA agents.</p>
<p>While serving time in the US jail, Yaroshenko repeatedly complained that he had been beaten and accused the prison administration of denying him medical help.</p>

<p>According to Yaroshenko and his wife, his health dramatically deteriorated while in US custody. However, an appeal lodged in 2012 was turned down a year later, as were the numerous clemency appeals sent over the years by the inmate and his wife to American Presidents Trump and Biden.</p>
<p>Yaroshenko himself said that he had lost trust in the US judiciary system, claiming that his case was politically motivated. Speaking to Russian journalists in 2016, he said that in America &ldquo;<em>you&rsquo;d better forget about democracy and human rights,</em>&rdquo; as evidenced by his case.</p>
<p>Soon after Yaroshenko&rsquo;s arrest and extradition to the US, Russia&rsquo;s Ministry of Justice mounted a campaign to free him, or at least let him serve the rest of his sentence in Russia, petitioning Washington to transfer him home. Back in 2019, Moscow also offered a prisoner swap with the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Beijing accuses Washington of "deliberately" harming peace and stability</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>The Chinese military on Wednesday condemned the latest US patrol mission in the Taiwan Strait, calling the arrival of the warship a <em>&ldquo;provocation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The USS Sampson guided-missile destroyer sailed through the strait on Tuesday and, according to a statement by the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, was <em>&ldquo;tracked and monitored&rdquo;</em> by Chinese vessels along its entire route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The US frequently carries out such provocative actions, sending wrong signals to &lsquo;Taiwan independence&rsquo; forces, and deliberately undermining the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,&rdquo;</em> the statement read, adding that the Chinese military <em>&ldquo;firmly opposes&rdquo;</em> such moves.</p>
<p>The US 7th Fleet spokesperson, Nicholas Lingo, said earlier that the USS Sampson's mission <em>&ldquo;demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Despite China's objections, the US sends warships to patrol the area once a month as part of freedom of navigation exercises. Washington regards the Taiwan Strait as international waters, claiming that it has the legal right to operate there without limitations.</p>
<p>Beijing considers Taiwan to be a breakaway territory under its One-China policy. The island of 23.5 million has been self-governed since 1949, but never formally declared independence from China.</p>
<p>Despite recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate authority in China since 1979, the US has maintained strong unofficial ties with Taipei, backing its push for sovereignty and supplying arms to the island.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Washington had made or facilitated nearly $20 billion in arms sales and $2.5 billion in direct commercial sales to Taiwan since 2017.</p>
<p>He reiterated that the White House was <em>&ldquo;determined to make sure that [Taiwan] has all necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression, including unilateral action by China to disrupt the status quo that&rsquo;s been in place for many decades.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Tensions between the US and China have further deteriorated since the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in late February. Washington has been unable to pressure Beijing to condemn Moscow and join international sanctions.</p>
<p>China has called for peace, but blamed the outbreak of the conflict on the continuing US push to expand NATO close to the Russian border.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Political crisis in Pakistan and its foreign policy: Constant and non-constant variables</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Pakistan&rsquo;s traditionally complex and intricate domestic political environment has just experienced another reshuffling. With the government headed by Imran Khan determined to salvage its position, even by dissolving the National Assembly (the lower chamber of the parliament), the joint opposition led by Shehbaz Sharif proved its resolve to oust the prime minister by appealing to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, another powerful un-elected institution &ndash; the army &ndash; waited in the wings to come on stage.</p>
<p>However, the play&rsquo;s outcome turned out to be less dramatic than some may have expected: parliamentarism, at the time empowered by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation of constitutionalism, prevailed over the controversial &lsquo;doctrine of necessity.&rsquo; The reconvened National Assembly eventually voted in favor of the no-confidence motion that ended up forcing Khan from his post.</p>
<p>This could have been just another story of &lsquo;how Pakistani civilian rulers can lose power&rsquo; if one did not come to notice the presence of Russia in the room.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What does &lsquo;Aazadi&rsquo; mean?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"We are not a nation to be used as a tissue paper. We do not want a one-sided relationship with anyone. When European Union ambassadors gave a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;against protocol asking Pakistan to condemn Russia ... can they say that in India? Do they have the courage? "</em> &ndash; said the former prime minister during his address to the nation on April 8.</p>

<p>This time, Imran Khan had to accept the fact that he had lost the support of both the political class &ndash; the wide range of opposition parties along with dissidents from his own coalition; and the establishment &ndash; the military, judiciary, civilian bureaucracy, ulema (Muslim clergy), business circles and landowners. However, the ousted national leader invoked a trump card that is certain to play its role in the future: the allegation of foreign conspiracy.</p>
<p>Both the country&rsquo;s power elite and its population at large have always realized that the idea of the &lsquo;Muslim Nation&rsquo; &ndash; which is part of the two-nation theory that predetermined the Partition of British India &ndash; is a rather fragile construct. After gaining independence from the British in 1947, Pakistan has survived several bloody conflicts with India over Kashmir and other disputed territories, the secession of East Pakistan, innumerable insurgencies in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. However, within the national meta-narrative all of those misfortunes have historically been attributed to foreign interference aimed at undermining Pakistani &lsquo;aazadi&rsquo; &ndash; an important national concept that in the Urdu language means &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; or &lsquo;independence&rsquo; &ndash; and thus ultimately destroying the nation.</p>
<p>In Pakistani discourse, India is undoubtedly seen as ranking first among states that seek to <em>&ldquo;eliminate even the idea of the existence of the Muslim Nation.&rdquo;</em> Hence, the idea of full preparedness to deter what are perceived as <em>&ldquo;India&rsquo;s aggressive policies,&rdquo;</em> counter its <em>&ldquo;covert intrigues&rdquo;</em> and uncover<em> &ldquo;insidious conspiracies&rdquo;</em> organized by Indian security agencies is inherent in Pakistani society. Not giving this sufficient attention is seen to be endangering aazadi and statehood itself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, India is not alone in the interference ranking and is joined by an unsurprising character: the United States. Pakistan&rsquo;s ties with Washington are ambiguous and have seen many ups and downs, but the two nations still appear to be indispensable to each other. It is therefore no wonder that it was the US that first voiced concern and objections in the wake of Khan&rsquo;s visit to Moscow on February 23-24.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategic partnership vs giving up to the infidel</strong></h3>
<p>At the dawn of the Cold War, US strategists seem to have taken rather reasonable steps by compelling Pakistan to join American initiatives in constructing a regional security architecture. The goal was to contain Soviet expansion in Asia. Back then, Pakistan had no choice but to align with a superpower to enhance its defense capabilities &ndash; otherwise, the lion&rsquo;s share of its resources would have been spent on deterring India alone.</p>

<p>The US and Pakistan put a premium on defense cooperation, including officer training, arms trade and the building of military infrastructure. By the mid-1960s, Pakistan had become better equipped with arms and ammunition than its archrival India. However, when Islamabad needed decisive support from Washington during the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971, the Americans preferred to abstain and watch from afar the defeat of its <em>&ldquo;very important ally.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>During the 1970s, America turned a blind eye to Pakistani strategic considerations but spared no effort in lambasting Islamabad on sensitive domestic issues. The situation changed when the Soviets intervened in Afghanistan, and Pakistan was proclaimed a &lsquo;frontline state,&rsquo; at which point Washington provided it with military and financial aid to train the Mujahideen. However, no sooner had Soviet troops left Afghan soil than the US forgot about the strategic importance of Pakistan, and Islamabad was left to clean its Augean stables without any assistance.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were plenty of issues to deal with: an influx of refugees from the neighboring war-torn country, the rise of radical Islamism at home, and free circulation of arms and drugs. Public dissatisfaction with the US actions and resentment at domestic governments &ldquo;<em>obeying kafirs&rdquo;</em> tilted the narrative in an anti-secular, anti-Western and anti-American direction. Consequently, ever since and up to the present day the Pakistani political elite has had to balance the necessity of cooperating with the US against deep-rooted public discontent at such cooperation, which is seen as <em>&ldquo;denigrating the idea of Pakistani aazadi.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This pattern is unlikely to change: the US wants Pakistan to be in the right place when it is needed, but when the need is gone Islamabad&rsquo;s efforts are of no importance. Meanwhile, the efforts that Pakistan does undertake at the urging of the Americans seemingly do not imbue the nation&rsquo;s populace with much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Thus, one should not be surprised that Imran Khan, an experienced populist, positions himself as an advocate of a multilateral approach to foreign relations. However, notwithstanding the significant recent development of Russian-Pakistani relations, which have borne out the prime minister&rsquo;s multipolar ambitions, crossing a red line on this path made the establishment reconsider Khan&rsquo;s position, which eventually became fatal for him.</p>
<h3><strong>Glass ceiling of thoughtful choice</strong></h3>
<p>Russia-Pakistan ties have in fact made great strides in recent years. To begin with, since Russia is wary of non-traditional security threats to Central Asian states from Afghanistan, it maintains a dialogue on security issues with Pakistan &ndash; the only regional actor having some leverage over the Taliban. Cooperation in the defense sector has manifested itself in the &lsquo;Druzhba&rsquo; (Friendship) regular joint military exercises and Russian participation in the &lsquo;Aman&rsquo; (Peace) regular multinational naval drills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both countries are determined to facilitate economic interaction with a focus on the energy sector and agriculture. Russian capabilities in these areas could be of great value in dealing with South Asia&rsquo;s eternal problems of energy and food security. And finally, the views of Moscow and Islamabad are aligned on multiple international issues, especially when it concerns Western unilateral steps.</p>
<p>However, these dynamics should not be overestimated. Russia-Pakistan relations have long been complicated by the countries having belonged to opposing blocs during the Cold War and the mutual mistrust in the context of the Afghan crisis. Accordingly, Russia has shown a clear propensity to foster relations with India, whereas Pakistan has turned toward the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there is one truly crucial determinant that Russia bears in mind &ndash; it is India that is Russia&rsquo;s Special Privileged Strategic Partner, not Pakistan. This imperative of Russian foreign policy has existed for decades and is certain to be in place in the aftermath of current developments.</p>
<p>That is why Moscow is going to be extremely careful about cooperating with Islamabad &ndash; especially in the fields that might bother New Delhi. And Russia hopes for a reciprocal approach when it concerns the interaction between India and the US. Otherwise, an obsession with loyalty to one country at the expense of relations with another would likely bring about unintended consequences.</p>
<h3><strong>History has no end</strong></h3>
<p>What we should stipulate is that the removal of Imran Khan from office in essence stems from various mounting challenges at home and the government&rsquo;s inability to tackle them. Ultimately, Khan&rsquo;s visit to Moscow and the disapproval of that visit publicly articulated by the US merely served as a pretext for the establishment&rsquo;s decision to leave the prime minister alone on the playing field.</p>
<p>With the umpire out, the game is getting rougher. The joint opposition had threatened Imran Khan with a no-confidence motion right after the general elections in 2018, but finally demonstrated its willingness to undertake decisive steps after receiving the relevant signals from the army. While the prime minister was focused on scrutinizing the US and appealing to anti-American sentiment, the men in uniform decided to rebalance Pakistan&rsquo;s strategic priorities at the expense of developing relations with Russia.</p>

<p>The chief of the Army Staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, stated that the Russian military operation in Ukraine must be <em>&ldquo;stopped immediately&rdquo;</em> and that Pakistan shared a <em>&ldquo;long and excellent strategic relationship with the US.&rdquo;</em> Such statements should not disturb a patient observer &ndash; the military wants to fix its ties with the US and thus is willing to be critical of Russian actions. Even so, such an equilibrium is unlikely to be durable. Renewed romances between the US and Pakistan usually do not last long, while there is always room for improving Russia-Pakistan relations.</p>
<p>The same considerations apply to Imran Khan&rsquo;s political future. Pakistani history has seen some ousted prime ministers return to office &ndash; the weapon to take the reins back is the Pakistani article of faith that foreign powers aim to encroach on the nation&rsquo;s aazadi. That feeling is certain to be a constant variable in the nation&rsquo;s sensibility and sooner or later the opportunity to appeal to it will come. And the Americans will not fail Imran Khan &ndash; they will undoubtedly provide him with the chance to make such an appeal.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Gazprom has blamed Sofia and Warsaw’s failure to pay for fuel in rubles</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Gazprom, Russia&rsquo;s main natural gas supplier, has announced a complete halt in gas exports to Bulgaria and Poland on Wednesday after the two countries refused to make payments in rubles. According to a statement, supplies will not resume until Sofia and Warsaw comply with the new terms.</p>
<p>The Saint Petersburg-based energy giant warned that should Bulgaria and Poland start siphoning off Russian transit gas intended for other countries, it will reduce supplies by the amount Sofia and Warsaw has illegally withheld.</p>
<p>In a statement early on Wednesday, the company&nbsp;explained that &ldquo;<em>as of the end of the working day on 26 April, Gazprom Export had not received ruble payments for gas deliveries in April from the companies &lsquo;Bulgargaz&rsquo; (Bulgaria) and PGNiG (Poland)</em>,&rdquo; as required under President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s decree dated 31 March. It noted that &ldquo;<em>payments for gas delivered since 1 April must be made in rubles</em>,&rdquo; and that both companies had been notified of this &ldquo;<em>in a timely manner</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last month, Putin required states&nbsp;which have imposed sanctions on Russia, and are still importing its gas, to use the Russian currency for transactions. Several buyers have signaled a willingness to accept Moscow&rsquo;s demands. On Monday Uniper, Germany&rsquo;s largest importer of Russian gas, said it would be possible to pay for future supplies without breaching Western sanctions.</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has expressed a similar point of view, as has the Hungarian government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniper revealed on Monday that there was a way to walk the thin line between complying with EU sanctions and meeting Russia&rsquo;s requirement for ruble payments. A company representative said in an e-mailed statement that &ldquo;<em>according to an initial and therefore still non-binding assessment, we still consider a compliant future payment processing to be feasible</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poland has refused to follow this procedure and on Tuesday sanctioned Gazprom, which owns a 48% stake in the Polish company that co-owns the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. The 4,000-kilometer route transports gas from the Yamal Peninsula and western Siberia to Germany and Poland via Belarus.</p>
<p>Speaking to the radio station RMF on Wednesday, Petr Naimsky, a Polish government official overseeing the country&rsquo;s strategic energy infrastructure, said Warsaw would no longer buy gas from Russia.</p>
<p>While Bulgaria&rsquo;s current 10-year contract with Gazprom was set to expire at the end of this year, the ministry&rsquo;s statement said that Bulgargaz would not finish the contract if it had to pay in rubles, stating that the setup <em>&ldquo;poses significant risks to Bulgaria.&rdquo; </em>Sofia&nbsp;relies on Russia for around 90% of its gas, with the remainder coming from Azerbaijan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, a spokesman for state energy firm Bulgargaz told reporters that, as of this summer, Baku&nbsp;will provide the country&rsquo;s entire supply, albeit at a higher price. Further ahead, Bulgaria&rsquo;s government <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-chart-course-southeast-europe-shift-russia-gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plans</a> to connect the country to an as-yet-unfinished Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Greece, where gas will be imported by ship, likely from the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Australia&rsquo;s Labor Party has put forward a plan to hike security spending in the Pacific and devote resources to training regional allies, with an opposition spokesperson blasting the current government for failing to address the growing threat allegedly posed by China.</p>
<p>The center-left party <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-australia-united-states-scott-morrison-solomon-islands-b16f59e53e5ed19876ea5e3bc27ac3c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled</a> an idea on Tuesday to <em>&ldquo;build a stronger Pacific region,"</em>&nbsp;saying that it would boost engagement with local partners should Labor win elections set for May 21, including with a new <em>&ldquo;Australia-Pacific Defense School&rdquo;</em> for military training.</p>
<p>While it did not elaborate on exactly what role the school would have, the party also called for a twofold increase in funding for the Pacific Maritime Security Program &ndash; saying it would help to <em>&ldquo;protect Pacific countries&rsquo; economic exclusive zones&rdquo;</em> &ndash; as well as to boost <em>&ldquo;Australian public media content to audiences in our region.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Speaking to reporters, Labor&rsquo;s foreign affairs spokesperson Penny Wong criticized Prime Minister Scott Morrison&rsquo;s supposed weakness toward Beijing, warning that China could increase its military presence in the Pacific after signing a security pact with the Solomon Islands last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be clear: the prospect of a Chinese base less than 2,000 kilometers from Australia&rsquo;s coastline is dramatically detrimental to Australia&rsquo;s security interests,&rdquo;</em> she <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorWong/status/1518881481875427330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. <em>&ldquo;That has occurred on Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s watch, and the response appears to be more chest beating.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Wong went on to describe the China-Solomons security pact as the <em>&ldquo;worst failure of Australian foreign policy in the Pacific since the end of World War II.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong></strong>Though officials in Canberra and Washington have warned that the deal with the islands could mean a new Chinese military base in the region, Beijing has rebuffed these suggestions as <em>&ldquo;completely fake news made up by a few people with ulterior motives.&rdquo;</em> The Chinese foreign ministry also recalled that the Solomon Islands is an <em>&ldquo;independent sovereign country, not the &lsquo;backyard&rsquo; of the United States and Australia&rdquo;</em> following vocal objections from both countries over the new arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>While the Labor Party has hit Morrison&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;chaotic government&rdquo;</em> with a <a href="https://twitter.com/AustralianLabor/status/1518826568344227840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long list of complaints</a> ahead of the upcoming election &ndash; including cuts to certain military programs &ndash; the PM rejected its criticisms as <em>&ldquo;farcical.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;What they&rsquo;re effectively saying is they&rsquo;re going to keep doing what we&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo;</em> Morrison said on Tuesday, arguing that under his administration, Australia has provided the Pacific with some $1.3 billion per year in assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>Australia is the only country to maintain diplomatic missions in all member states of the 13-nation Pacific Islands Forum, which includes the Solomons, and has provided each with naval patrol boats over the years, according to the Associated Press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though the minister did not elaborate, his remarks come around three months after mass protests erupted in Kazakhstan, initially triggered by a hike in fuel prices. Peaceful rallies became violent over the course of several days in January, with at least 225 people <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/546165-death-toll-kazakhstan-unrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killed</a> during clashes with security forces and thousands more injured and arrested.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>The unrest prompted a deployment by the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which sent peacekeepers into the country at Tokayev&rsquo;s request and ultimately helped to quell the violence. In response to protesters&rsquo; grievances, the government sacked several top officials and vowed a series of political and economic reforms, including the restoration of previous price controls on fuel.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The president claimed tens of thousands of <em>&ldquo;foreign-trained terrorists&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;bandits&rdquo;</em> were behind the rioting, arguing they aimed to carry out a coup on behalf of another state, though he did not provide evidence for the assertion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Li said the protests were driven by <em>&ldquo;three evil forces&rdquo;</em> of extremism, terrorism and separatism, offering support from Beijing&rsquo;s security forces.

                            <p><strong>Oklahoma’s governor has signed into law a bill prohibiting gender markers other than male and female on state documents</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Oklahoma has become the first US state to prohibit a nonbinary option on birth certificates, enacting legislation that supporters claimed would help ensure <em>&ldquo;clarity and truth&rdquo;</em> on official documents.</p>
<p>Governor Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law on Tuesday, following up on an executive order that he issued last November prohibiting the Oklahoma State Health Department (OSDH) from amending gender designations on birth certificates. The <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/executive/2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy</a> began after the OSDH &ndash; unbeknownst to the governor &ndash; settled a civil lawsuit by agreeing to allow a nonbinary option.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;People are free to believe whatever they want about their identity, but science has determined people are either biologically male or female at birth,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.okhouse.gov/members/District.aspx?District=69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Representative Sheila Dills, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill on gender designations. <em>&ldquo;We want clarity and truth on official state documents. Information should be based on established medical fact and not an ever-changing social dialogue.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>More than a dozen US states allow for gender designations other than male and female on their birth certificates. Others don&rsquo;t provide a nonbinary option, but Oklahoma is reported to be the first to legally prohibit the designation.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration last month announced that it was making an &ldquo;X&rdquo; gender marker available on <a href="https://www.state.gov/x-gender-marker-available-on-u-s-passports-starting-april-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US passports</a>. The US State Department had previously begun allowing citizens to self-select the gender identity on their documents.</p>
<p>The new law relating to birth certificates comes less than one month after Stitt signed a bill prohibiting biological males from participating in girls&rsquo; sports. More than a dozen Republican-controlled legislatures have passed such bills since 2020.</p>
<p>Oklahomans elected the nation&rsquo;s first openly nonbinary legislator, Mauree Turner, in 2020. The Oklahoma City Democrat, whose Twitter profile includes <em>&ldquo;not a woman,&rdquo;</em> spoke out against the bill on nonbinary gender markers as it was being debated in the House last week. <em>&ldquo;I find it very extreme and grotesque use of power in this body to write this law and try to pass it when literally none of them live like this,&rdquo;</em> Turner <a href="https://twitter.com/MaureeTurnerOK/status/1517178201520459778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p>

                            <p><strong>One executive said Twitter’s censors are now in a “very difficult” position, while another reportedly cried</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Leaks from Twitter&rsquo;s staff meeting to discuss the takeover by Elon Musk show executives getting emotional and trying to cope with the coming changes. On Tuesday, Project Veritas published leaked audio of two executives, while Politico reported that a third one teared up during the Monday meeting.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Elon made it clear in public that a large part of the reason he bought the platform was because of our moderation policies and disagreements in how we deal with health,&rdquo;</em> Twitter&rsquo;s Chief Marketing Officer and Head of People Leslie Berland can be heard saying in the leaked audio. <em>&ldquo;This puts Twitter service and Trust and Safety as well as anybody who cares about health on the platform in a very difficult position.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The one-minute recording shared by Project Veritas to the <a href="https://rumble.com/v12jmus-project-veritas-leaks-audio-from-internal-twitter-meeting-after-elon-musk-t.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Millennial</a> on Tuesday also features CEO Parag Agrawal, who had taken over from company founder Jack Dorsey in December.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I believe Twitter grows as a service, allows for more people to use the product and have a better experience because we&rsquo;re able to make the conversation on Twitter be safe because we have built tools, processes for people to be able to feel safe and control their experiences. I believe that there is a lot of work we have to do to continue making that better,&rdquo;</em> Agrawal said.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Sometimes that means more thoughtful moderation. Sometimes that means making things simpler. Sometimes that means changing product incentives to be able to solve problems through products sometimes, instead of policies.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Twitter announced on Monday it would accept Musk&rsquo;s $44-billion buyout. The SpaceX and Tesla founder vowed to take the platform private and return it to its free-speech roots. On Tuesday, Musk noted <em>&ldquo;the extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech,&rdquo;</em> and said his definition of the term is what matches the law.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,&rdquo;</em> Musk tweeted. <em>&ldquo;If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>The First Amendment of the US Constitution explicitly prohibits Congress from making any laws infringing on the freedom of speech or the press.</p>

                            <p><strong>New PM assures billionaire that Islamabad is committed to eradicating polio, after first case in over a year</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Pakistan&rsquo;s newly elected prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, has assured billionaire vaccine promoter Bill Gates that his country is committed to fully eradicating polio and will continue working with the Microsoft co-founder&rsquo;s foundation on public-health initiatives.</p>
<p>Sharif spoke with Gates by telephone on Tuesday, saying that his government is determined to eradicate all forms of polio. The software magnate reiterated that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) will continue supporting Pakistan&rsquo;s government to help ensure that no child is at risk of being paralyzed by polio.</p>
<p>The country had gone more than a year without a single new polio case &ndash; a feat that Gates hailed after traveling to Islamabad to meet with Pakistan's then-Prime Minister Imran Khan in February &ndash; but officials this month confirmed the first new infection in 15 months after a boy was paralyzed by the virus in North Waziristan district.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ongoing public health and social sector programmes supported by BMGF in Pakistan were discussed, including polio eradication and the Foundation’s support towards improving immunisation, nutrition and financial inclusion services in Pakistan.</p>&mdash; Prime Minister&#39;s Office (@PakPMO) <a href="https://twitter.com/PakPMO/status/1518991107165761537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>Sharif and Gates discussed such topics as working to improve vaccination rates in Pakistan and providing poor people with better nutrition and <em>&ldquo;financial inclusion services.&rdquo;</em> They also discussed the country&rsquo;s Covid-19 vaccination drive, and the PM called for resuming inoculations against polio in neighboring Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s parliament elected Sharif as prime minister earlier this month, after Khan was <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/553648-mass-protests-pakistan-khan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ousted</a> in a no-confidence motion. Khan had claimed that his cabinet was overthrown in a plot arranged by the US and that Pakistan was being handed over to an <em>&ldquo;imported government led by crooks.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Pakistan has endured an uphill battle to inoculate children against polio, partly because of claims that vaccination campaigns in the country are part of a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Militants have targeted public-health workers, and the police protecting them, to disrupt vaccine drives. A female worker administering polio shots in northwestern Pakistan was shot and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/gunmen-kill-polio-worker-pakistan-vaccination-campaign-83203643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killed</a> last month.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Making new Stinger missiles will take “years” due to component shortages, says Raytheon CEO</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>As Ukraine burns through anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles the US has been supplying, Raytheon's CEO warned on Tuesday that the company won&rsquo;t be able to replenish the Pentagon stockpiles for at least several years, citing a shortage of electronic components.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We're going to have to go out and redesign some of the electronics in the missile and the seeker head,&rdquo;</em> Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told investment analysts during the company&rsquo;s quarterly earnings call, according to <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2022/04/it-will-be-years-raytheon-can-build-new-stinger-missiles/366105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defense One</a>. <em>&ldquo;That's going to take us a little bit of time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hayes was specifically referring to the FIM-92 Stinger, the portable air defense missile that the Pentagon has been supplying to Ukrainian troops. The FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile, which the US has also been sending to Kiev, is produced jointly with Lockheed Martin. Ukrainian officials told the US last month that they required 500 Stingers and Javelins per day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raytheon hasn&rsquo;t made Stingers for the US military in almost 20 years, and the ones being sent to Ukraine are coming out of the Pentagon stockpiles. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has said Raytheon had <em>&ldquo;a very limited stock of material for Stinger production&rdquo;</em> and that the Pentagon was <em>&ldquo;actively trying to resource some of the materials,&rdquo;</em> again according to Defense One.</p>
<p>Hayes said he doesn&rsquo;t expect the Pentagon to place <em>&ldquo;large&rdquo;</em> replenishment orders for either missile until 2023 or 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to <em>&ldquo;keep moving heaven and earth&rdquo;</em> so the US and its allies could supply Ukraine and help it <em>&ldquo;win&rdquo;</em> in the conflict with Russia. He was in Ramstein, Germany, presiding over a meeting of representatives from almost 40 countries that have pledged military assistance to Ukraine. Visiting Kiev over the weekend, Austin said the US wants to see Russia <em>&ldquo;weakened&rdquo;</em> by the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>Last month, the Pentagon speculated that Russia had used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles against Ukrainian supply depots because it was running low on missiles. Austin <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lloyd-austin-defense-secretary-transcript-face-the-nation-03-20-2022/">wondered</a> on March 20 if Russia was <em>&ldquo;running low on precision-guided munitions,&rdquo;</em> while his spokesman John Kirby later said the use of Kinzhals <em>&ldquo;could very well be tied to inventory problems and performance problems that they're having with respect to PGMs,&rdquo;</em> a claim made by another Pentagon official, for which no evidence was ever provided.</p>
<p>The Stinger first entered service in 1981. Washington sent an unknown number of the missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, claiming that they helped the Islamist guerrillas successfully nullify Soviet air superiority. Some of the missiles were later turned against American troops during the 20-year US occupation of Afghanistan, which ended last August with an airlift from Kabul.</p>

<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Multiple explosions were heard over Damascus shortly before 1 am local time on Wednesday, with Syrian media accusing Israel of yet another missile attack. Tel Aviv has not officially commented on the claim, but Israel has repeatedly attacked what it said were Iranian <em>&ldquo;assets&rdquo;</em> inside Syria, claiming pre-emptive self-defense.</p>
<p>Syrian air defenses were confronting <em>&ldquo;Israeli aggression&rdquo;</em> in the skies over Damascus, the state news agency SANA <a href="https://sana.sy/?p=1636914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Wednesday. No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports that at least half a dozen missiles had been fired into Syrian territory, and that at least two got through the air defenses. A <em>&ldquo;big explosion&rdquo;</em> was <a href="https://twitter.com/leithfadel/status/1519075097608400896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> in the rural area of the Damascus province, northwest of the capital.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not officially acknowledged the attack. However, Tel Aviv rarely does so, and has maintained it has the right to bomb Syria in self-defense, citing the Iranian military presence in the neighboring country. Damascus has condemned these attacks as acts of aggression and violations of Syrian sovereignty.</p>
<p>Israel War Room, a nonprofit based in the US, <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraelWarRoom/status/1519071889435414528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the Israeli aviation was <em>&ldquo;engaging in targeted defensive airstrikes against Iranian assets in and around Damascus,&rdquo;</em> adding that Israel <em>&ldquo;has the right to defend its borders against a buildup of Iranian military hardware and proxy terrorists.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Top diplomat says Washington will make sure Taipei has all it needs to defend itself against Beijing</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Washington is doing everything in its power to ensure that Taiwan can withstand any potential attack, by supporting its indigenous military industry, expediting <em>&ldquo;third-party transfers,&rdquo;</em> and helping the island boost its <em>&ldquo;asymmetric&rdquo;</em> deterrence capabilities, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When it comes to Taiwan itself, we are determined to make sure that it has all necessary means to defend itself against any potential aggression, including unilateral action by China to disrupt the status quo that&rsquo;s been in place for many decades,&rdquo;</em> Blinken said on Tuesday in a testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blinken noted that the US has made or facilitated nearly $20 billion in arms sales and $2.5 billion in direct commercial sales to Taiwan since 2017. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been expediting third-party transfers to Taiwan,&rdquo;</em> he added. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been supporting indigenous industrial defense capability. And we are focused on helping them think about how to strengthen asymmetric capabilities, again as a deterrent.&rdquo;</em></p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p>The committee&rsquo;s chairman, Senator Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey), warned that if China were to seize Taiwan, it would gain a stranglehold on the world&rsquo;s high-end semiconductor market. He estimated that Taiwan produces 90 percent of all high-end semiconductors globally.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;If, in fact, China could overwhelm and take Taiwan and now have control of 90% of the world&rsquo;s semiconductors, the world would be in a world of hurt,&rdquo;</em> Menendez said. He added that failing to come to Taiwan&rsquo;s aid would send a message to US allies and would-be allies in the region, which would say, <em>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if they didn&rsquo;t do it for Taiwan, they&rsquo;re not going to do it for us&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Blinken agreed and noted that Washington has a technological advantage over Beijing on the most advanced semiconductors. He said President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration was working with Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands and other countries to <em>&ldquo;make sure that when it comes to the highest-end semiconductors that they are not transferred to China or China does not get the technology to manufacture them. Taiwan is integral to that.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>US relations with China have worsened since Russia launched its military offensive against Ukraine in February, as Washington has been unable to persuade Beijing to help Western powers punish and isolate Moscow. In Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, Blinken told senators that China is <em>&ldquo;paying a reputational cost,&rdquo;</em> especially in Europe, for <em>&ldquo;sitting on the fence when it comes to Russian aggression against Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>China has blamed the US and its NATO allies for instigating the Ukraine crisis by breaking promises against expanding the alliance eastward after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and it has called for peace talks to end the conflict. With NATO members sending billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine for use against Russian forces, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called on Tuesday for restraint and de-escalation.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No one wants to see the outbreak of a third world war,&rdquo;</em> Wang said. He also rebuked Western powers for criticizing China&rsquo;s policies, saying Washington is guilty of war crimes, economic coercion and betraying allies. <em>&ldquo;Facts have proven that the US is the biggest spreader of disinformation, culprit of coercive diplomacy and saboteur of world peace and stability,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Blinken&rsquo;s latest comments on Taiwan likely won&rsquo;t help mend fences with Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province of China. The US has maintained a <em>&lsquo;One China&rsquo;</em> policy, under which it acknowledges but doesn&rsquo;t endorse Beijing&rsquo;s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Chinese officials have repeatedly warned against US meddling in Taiwan, saying they will take steps to defend their nation&rsquo;s territorial integrity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>The new Twitter owner reassures governments he will obey speech-squelching laws</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Billionaire Twitter purchaser Elon Musk has qualified his much-hyped embrace of &ldquo;<em>free speech</em>&rdquo; on Tuesday, his first full day as the platform&rsquo;s owner, reassuring the world&rsquo;s governments he will obey their speech restrictions under the reasoning that such officials behave according to the will of the people they govern.</p>
<p>After gloating that &ldquo;<em>the extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all</em>,&rdquo; the Tesla tycoon explained that what he meant by &ldquo;<em>free speech</em>&rdquo; was not the usual definition, replying to his own tweet to reveal that &ldquo;<em>By &lsquo;free speech&rsquo;, I simply mean that which matches the law</em>.&rdquo;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law. <br><br>I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. <br><br>If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.<br><br>Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1519036983137509376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    

<p>&ldquo;<em>If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect</em>,&rdquo; Musk continued, explaining his latest stance. &ldquo;<em>Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the billionaire did not explain which country&rsquo;s laws he planned to respect, he was reminded of a recent set of regulations passed in Europe under the name the &lsquo;Digital Services Act&rsquo;, which aims to force social network platforms to police their content much more aggressively, revealing their proprietary algorithms to regulators and explaining how they are working to better comply with EU rules on hate speech and misinformation.</p>

<p>EU Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton declared that Musk would have to follow Europe&rsquo;s strict new rules or face heavy fines or even a continental ban, telling the Financial Times that Musk was &ldquo;<em>welcome but these are our rules. It&rsquo;s not your rules which will apply here.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s Tuesday comments represented a significant step back from his claims the previous day that &ldquo;<em>free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy</em>&rdquo; and his description of himself as a &ldquo;<em>free speech absolutist</em>.&rdquo; The SpaceX founder purchased Twitter on Monday for the sum of $44 billion, vowing to take it private and return it to its roots as &ldquo;<em>the free speech wing of the free speech party</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twitter is headquartered in the US. Europe has much stricter rules delineating the boundaries of freedom of speech, while the US&rsquo; own regulations give platforms like Twitter protection from liability for user-generated content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                            <p><strong>Gazprom will cease delivering gas to Bulgaria on Wednesday, energy ministry says</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>Russian energy giant Gazprom will cease delivering gas to Bulgaria on Wednesday, the country&rsquo;s energy ministry announced on Tuesday. The news comes after the Saint Petersburg firm&nbsp;confirmed it will also halt supplies to Poland, with both countries refusing to pay for energy supplies in rubles.</p>
<p>The ministry announced the news in a statement, adding that there would be no imminent need for consumers to ration their gas usage. Bulgaria relies on Russia for around 90% of its gas, with the remainder coming from Azerbaijan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, a spokesman for state energy firm Bulgargaz told reporters that, as of this summer, Azerbaijan will provide the country&rsquo;s entire supply, albeit at a higher price. Further ahead, Bulgaria&rsquo;s government <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-chart-course-southeast-europe-shift-russia-gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plans</a> to connect the country to a yet-unfinished Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Greece, where gas will be imported by ship, likely from the US.</p>

<p>News of the cutoff came shortly after Poland&rsquo;s state energy company PGNiG confirmed that it too had received notification from Gazprom that the flow of Russian gas would be shut off on Wednesday. Both countries have refused to pay for Russian gas in rubles, as Moscow has demanded all <em>&ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo;</em> countries do as of this week.</p>
<p>Bulgaria&rsquo;s current 10-year contract with Gazprom was set to expire at the end of this year, but the ministry&rsquo;s statement said that Bulgargaz would not finish the contract if it had to pay in rubles, stating that the setup <em>&ldquo;poses significant risks to Bulgaria.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Several Russian gas buyers have signaled they might be able to agree to Moscow&rsquo;s demands. On Monday, Uniper, Germany&rsquo;s major importer of Russian gas, said it would be possible to pay for future supplies without breaching Western sanctions.</p>

<p>Until Brussels is able to &ldquo;<em>reorganize</em>&rdquo; that relationship &ldquo;<em>and agree on security guarantees and mechanisms to allow for peaceful coexistence to take hold again</em>,&rdquo; it will back Ukraine in its fight against Moscow, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy continued.</p>
<p>Borrell then issued a precondition to such a reorganization, declaring that <em>&ldquo;[the]&nbsp;Russian leadership must first understand that its own security cannot and will not be attained at the expense of broader European security and that of its neighbors.</em>&rdquo; Peace in Europe can only exist if Moscow&nbsp;is &ldquo;<em>respectful of national sovereignty and territorial integrity</em>,&rdquo; he wrote. He didn't, however, address NATO&rsquo;s eastward expansion in violation of an agreement not to further approach Russia&rsquo;s borders following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Insisting that the EU, US, and NATO had &ldquo;<em>replied carefully to Russian proposed treaties and letters</em>,&rdquo; Borrell argued that&nbsp;his bloc&nbsp;has always been &ldquo;<em>ready to discuss all aspects of security</em>.&rdquo; However, months of dialogue between the two sides failed to produce an agreement, with the US and its European allies unwilling to promise to exclude Ukraine from NATO prospects or provide other security guarantees with regard to stationing missiles in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Borrell claimed that the EU is fighting the good fight to &ldquo;<em>counter [the] false narratives</em>&rdquo; he believes are behind Russian support for the war, blaming Moscow for &ldquo;<em>launch[ing] an international disinformation offensive</em>,&rdquo; and implying backing for the campaign at home would evaporate if Russians could just read his bloc's media outlets. Borrell seemed to be unaware that they can read hundreds of them, should they so desire. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He also failed to mention that&nbsp;the EU last month issued an order to search engines and social media platforms to cease displaying Russian media or even discussions of its contents across Europe, ensuring only viewpoints authorized in Brussels would be accessible by European internet users.</p>

<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

            <p>Poland&rsquo;s state-owned energy company PGNiG has confirmed that Russian energy firm Gazprom will halt gas deliveries on the Yamal contract as of Wednesday. Earlier reports suggested that the supply from Russia had already been cut off.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Polish gas firm, <em>&ldquo;Gazprom informed PGNiG of its intention to completely suspend deliveries under the Yamal contract at the beginning of the contract day on April 27.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Gazprom spokesman announced that <em>&ldquo;today, Poland is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure,&rdquo;</em> referring to Russia&rsquo;s demand that <em>&ldquo;unfriendly countries&rdquo;</em> buy its gas in rubles.</p>

<p>Poland has refused to follow this procedure, and on Tuesday sanctioned Gazprom, which owns a 48% stake in the Polish company that co-owns the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. The 4,000km line transports gas from the Yamal Peninsula and western Siberia to Germany and Poland via Belarus.</p>
<p>Media reports soon followed, suggesting that the supply to Poland had already been stopped, and that the government in Warsaw had convened a crisis meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PGNiG insisted that supplies to consumers would be uninterrupted, with gas in storage and sourced from other suppliers making up the shortfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poland has been one of the staunchest proponents of the anti-Russia sanctions imposed by the US and EU since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in February, and has allowed Western weapons to enter Ukraine from its territory.</p>
<p>While some gas-dependent countries such as Germany have cautioned the EU against cutting off the flow from Russia, and others like Hungary have stated that they will keep buying Moscow's product, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has vowed to ban all Russian coal, oil and gas imports by the end of the year.</p>

                            <p><strong>Letting Moscow get away with its offensive in Ukraine would destroy the ‘global international security order,’ Mark Milley insists</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>America&rsquo;s top general has declared that Russia can&rsquo;t be allowed to get away with its offensive in Ukraine <em>&ldquo;cost-free,&rdquo;</em> because allowing such <em>&ldquo;aggression&rdquo;</em> would end the <em>&ldquo;global international security order&rdquo;</em> established after World War II.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If this is left to stand, if there is no answer to this aggression, if Russia gets away with this cost-free, then so goes the so-called international order and, if that happens, then we&rsquo;re entering into an era of seriously increased instability,&rdquo;</em> US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/politics/mark-milley-interview-cnntv/index.html?utm_content=2022-04-26T15%3A29%3A30&amp;utm_source=twcnnbrk&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Milley</a> said on Tuesday in an interview with CNN.</p>
<p>Milley made his comments after a meeting of Western military leaders in Germany to discuss efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia&rsquo;s offensive. Earlier this month, he called the conflict <em>&ldquo;the greatest threat to peace and security&rdquo;</em> during his 42-year career and said China and Russia seek to <em>&ldquo;fundamentally change the rules-based current global order.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Milley didn't&nbsp;explain whether in this&nbsp;"rules based international order" the same set of rules apply to everybody, equally, ie, is it "symmetrical" or "asymmetrical." Thus, if Russia intervenes in Syria at Damascus' request and US/UK enter Syria, without Syrian or UN permission, he may believe that Moscow, not Washington, has broken the rules. Such an interpretation&nbsp;would run contrary to international law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, he argued that Russia must be made to pay a price for its attack. <em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at stake is the global international security order that was put in place in 1945,&rdquo;</em> Milley said. <em>&ldquo;That international order has lasted 78 years. It&rsquo;s prevented great power war, and underlining that entire concept is the idea that large nations will not conduct military aggression against smaller nations, and that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happened here &ndash; an unprovoked military aggression by Russia against a smaller nation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Milley didn't mention instances where the US has acted against his point, such as in the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/3010300/secretary-austins-opening-remarks-at-the-ukraine-defense-consultative-group-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lloyd Austin</a> and Secretary of Defense Antony Blinken traveled to Kiev on Monday to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting with military allies in Germany, Austin said Western nations would <em>&ldquo;keep on moving heaven and earth&rdquo;</em> to meet Ukraine&rsquo;s security requirements and would move <em>&ldquo;at the speed of war&rdquo;</em> to support Kiev.</p>
<p>Referring to Ukrainian forces, Austin said, <em>&ldquo;Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world, even greater resolve to NATO.&rdquo;</em> He added, <em>&ldquo;Glory to Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> repeating part of the official slogan used by Ukrainian Nazi collaborators who allied with Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s Germany against the Soviet Union in World War II.</p>

<p>Ironically, Russian leaders might agree with part of Milley&rsquo;s assessment &ndash; that the global order may be altered. Moscow&rsquo;s military offensive in Ukraine aims to end the US-dominated world order, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this month. <em>&ldquo;Our special military operation is meant to put an end to the unabashed expansion [of NATO] and the unabashed drive toward full domination by the US and its Western subjects on the world stage,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Russia attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine&rsquo;s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, first signed in 2014, and Moscow&rsquo;s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has since demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.</p>

                            <p><strong>Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang’s nukes aren’t limited to defensive use and will be deployed if the country is provoked</strong></p>
            
                        
            <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ratcheted up his nuclear rhetoric, vowing to accelerate development of the country&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction and to deploy them offensively if DPRK&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;fundamental interests&rdquo;</em> are violated.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will continue to take measures for further developing the nuclear forces of our state at the fastest possible speed,&rdquo;</em> North Korean state-run media outlet KCNA quoted Kim as saying at a military parade on Monday night in Pyongyang. He added that North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear forces must be prepared for deployment <em>&ldquo;at any time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s nuclear weapons could be used proactively if North Korea is threatened, Kim told the crowd of troops and spectators. Monday&rsquo;s parade featured missiles capable of striking the country&rsquo;s adversaries, the state media outlet said. Those weapons included intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could carry a nuclear warhead to the US mainland and solid-fuel rockets that could be used against South Korea or Japan.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The fundamental mission of our nuclear forces is to deter a war, but our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent even at a time when a situation we are not desirous of at all is created on this land,&rdquo;</em> Kim said. <em>&ldquo;If any forces try to violate the fundamental interests of our state, our nuclear forces will have to decisively accomplish its unexpected second mission.&rdquo;</em> Such a strike would leave any enemy forces dead, he added.</p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s comments came amid increased geopolitical tensions &ndash; the US and other NATO members are rushing billions of dollars in weapons to Kiev and trying to devastate the Russian economy through sanctions to punish Moscow for its Ukraine offensive. On top of that, a leadership transition is taking place in Seoul. South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol is scheduled to take office on May 10 and has vowed to take a hard line against North Korea, declaring the need to <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/Yoon-to-take-hard-line-against-main-enemy-North-Korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;annihilate communism.&rdquo;</a></em></p>
<p>Yoon&rsquo;s predecessor, President Moon Jae-in, exchanged farewell letters with Kim this month after years of trying to negotiate a peace deal with North Korea. The two Koreas technically remain at war, as their bloody conflict ended in July 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>
<p>North Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests this year, including the purported launch last month of its newest and biggest ICBM, the Hwasong-17. Earlier this month, Kim oversaw the test-firing of a new guided weapon system that Pyongyang claims will enhance the capabilities of its tactical nukes.</p>
