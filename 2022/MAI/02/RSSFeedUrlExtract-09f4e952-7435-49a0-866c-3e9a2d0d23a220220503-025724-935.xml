<p>Cybersecurity pros interested in metrics and measures frequently ponder and pontificate on what measures would be best to show the board of directors. That can be a tricky proposition because “we have to speak like the business” is also a mantra. Coming up with cybersecurity metrics from a business perspective can be a challenge. So how can we solve this problem and provide useful insight?</p><p>Well, first we have to recognize that the board level is the highest strategic level in the company. If you provide metrics on patch status and phishing test results, you are essentially admitting that your cybersecurity program is built on a few hodge-podge activities and a prayer.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658118/cybersecurity-metrics-corporate-boards-want-to-see.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<h2>Computer virus definition</h2>
<p>A computer virus is a form of malicious software that piggybacks onto legitimate application code in order to spread and reproduce itself.</p><p>Like other <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2615925/security-your-quick-guide-to-malware-types.html">types of malware</a>, a virus is deployed by attackers to damage or take control of a computer. Its name comes from the method by which it infects its targets. A biological virus like HIV or the flu cannot reproduce on its own; it needs to hijack a cell to do that work for it, wreaking havoc on the infected organism in the process. Similarly, a computer virus isn't itself a standalone program. It's a code snippet that inserts itself into some other application. When that application runs, it executes the virus code, with results that range from the irritating to the disastrous.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3406446/computer-viruses-explained-definition-types-and-examples.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Phishing continues to be one of the primary attack mechanisms for bad actors with a variety of endgames in mind, in large part because phishing attacks are trivial to launch and difficult to fully protect against. Some phishing attacks target customers rather than employees, and others simply aim to damage your corporate reputation rather than compromise your systems. A key factor in protecting your business from phishing is to understand your vulnerabilities, weigh the potential risk to your business, and decide what tools offer the best protection to match your business needs.</p><h2>Why phishing is successful</h2>
<p>Most phishing attacks are less about the technology and more about social engineering. It’s amazing how easily humans are manipulated when emotions are triggered. Many modern phishing emails play on empathy or fear, or even make hostile accusations in order to trigger an angry response.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3575080/9-top-anti-phishing-tools-and-services.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Managed detection and response (MDR) service provider Proficio has launched ProSOC Identity Threat Detection and Response to protect businesses from identity-based attacks and credential abuse.

<p>The 2022 RSA Security Conference is just weeks away, and the security diaspora is boosted and ready to meet in person at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.</p><p>While we’ve certainly accomplished a lot working remotely over the past 2 years, cybersecurity remains in a precarious position in 2022, so an industry huddle is in order. We are at a point where the scale and complexity of historical security defenses either aren’t working or are stretched to their limits. This means CISOs need to think about security transformation, and as they do, every process and layer of the security technology stack is in play.</p><p>Now, there will be plenty of hype at the conference around security “platforms” like <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3633896/5-observations-about-xdr.html">extended detection and response (XDR)</a>, cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs), <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3574014/what-is-sase-a-cloud-service-that-marries-sd-wan-with-security.html">secure access service edge (SASE)</a>, and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247848/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html">zero trust</a>—all important topics but also strewn with industry hype and associated user confusion.

<p>Notorious threat group Emotet has been detected testing new and significantly different attack techniques potentially in preparation for larger campaigns or selective and limited attacks, according to research from cybersecurity vendor Proofpoint.

After a 10-month disappearance from the threat landscape, the group re-emerged in November 2021 and has since targeted thousands of users in multiple geographic regions. In some cases, the volume of malicious messages used in individual campaigns has reached over one million, Proofpoint stated. However, activity detected between April 4 and April 19, 2022, signifies a significant departure from Emotet’s typical attack behaviors, and is attributed to threat actor TA542.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658550/emotet-tests-new-attack-techniques-sign-of-things-to-come.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>The cloud services “shared responsibility” model goes something like this: the cloud provider protects everything below a certain level (that level generally being their software) and is responsible for securing it.  Consider that the foundation of your house.  You, the customer, are responsible for protecting everything above the foundation—securing the house, if you will.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3656914/the-cloud-security-emperor-has-no-pants.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>The <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3601508/solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-explained-why-organizations-were-not-prepared.html">SolarWinds compromise of 2020</a> had a global impact and garnered the resources of both public and private sectors in an all-hands-on-deck remediation effort. The event also had a deleterious effect on the SolarWinds stock price. These two events, were, predictably, followed by a bevy of civil lawsuits. Fast forward to late March 2022 and we have a federal court saying the suit that named SolarWinds; its vice president of security and CISO, Tim Brown; as well as two prime investor groups Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo may go forward.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3657874/solarwinds-breach-lawsuits-6-takeaways-for-cisos.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

It was late fall in 2016 when a fellow researcher joined him at the InGuardians lab, where he is director of research.

<p>Endpoint protection vendor Cybereason has launched a new incident response (IR) solution to streamline and automate IR investigations. Digital Forensics Incident Response incorporates nuanced forensics artifacts into threat hunting, reducing remediation time by enabling security analysts to contain cyberattacks in minutes, the firm stated in a press release. The release comes in the wake of new research that discovered a drop in global attack dwell times as organizations and their partners improve their incident detection and response capabilities.</p><h2><strong>Cybereason DFIR driven by forensics for deeper defense value</strong></h2>
<p>According to Cybereason, the new solution offers forensic-driven incident response that extends deeper value to defenders. By augmenting its existing MalOp Detection Engine with intelligence from DFIR, security analysts can leverage comprehensive detections from root cause across every impacted asset via a central point, the vendor added. As a result, security teams can quickly gain visibility into a wider range of intelligence sources to enable rapid decisions and remediate threats more efficiently.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3658195/cybereason-launches-dfir-solution-to-automate-incident-response.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
