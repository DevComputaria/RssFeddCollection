<div class="ng-star-inserted">
<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A draft opinion suggests the U.S. Supreme Court could be poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473"  target="_blank">Politico report</a> released Monday.</p>
<p>A decision to overrule Roe would lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states and could have huge ramifications for this year&#8217;s elections. But it&#8217;s unclear if the draft represents the court&rsquo;s final word on the matter &mdash; opinions often change in ways big and small in the drafting process.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, the Politico report represents an extremely rare breach of the court&rsquo;s secretive deliberation process, and on a case of surpassing importance.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,&rdquo; the draft opinion states. It was signed by Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court&rsquo;s 6-3 conservative majority who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The document was labeled a &ldquo;1st Draft&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Opinion of the Court&rdquo; in a case challenging Mississippi&rsquo;s ban on abortion after 15 weeks, a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization.</p>
<p>The court is expected to rule on the case before its term ends in late June or early July.</p>

<p>The draft opinion in effect states there is no constitutional right to abortion services and would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,&rdquo; it states, referencing the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey that affirmed Roe&rsquo;s finding of a constitutional right to abortion services but allowed states to place some constraints on the practice. &ldquo;It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people&rsquo;s elected representatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Supreme Court spokeswoman said the court had no comment and The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the draft Politico posted, which dates from February.</p>
<p>Politico said only that it received &ldquo;a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court&rsquo;s proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The draft opinion strongly suggests that when the justices met in private shortly after arguments in the case on Dec. 1, at least five voted to overrule Roe and Casey, and Alito was assigned the task of writing the court&#8217;s majority opinion.</p>
<p>Votes and opinions in a case aren&#8217;t final until a decision is announced or, in a change wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, posted on the court&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>The report comes amid a legislative push to restrict abortion in several Republican-led states &mdash; Oklahoma being the most recent &mdash; even before the court issues its decision. Critics of those measures have said low-income women will disproportionately bear the burden of the new restrictions.</p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Scott Olson/Getty Images </span><span class="caption" >Demonstrators hold a rally and march to voice support of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision by the U.S.Supreme Court that legalized abortion without excessive government restrictions, on March 8, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The leak jumpstarted the intense political reverberations that the high court&rsquo;s ultimate decision was expected to have in the midterm election year. Already, politicians on both sides of the aisle were seizing on the report to fundraise and energize their supporters on either side of the hot-button issue.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-reproductive-rights-bd86cf1c8ddbfd09c5e221c7a9d41e01"  target="_blank">AP-NORC poll</a> in December found that Democrats increasingly see protecting abortion rights as a high priority for the government.</p>
<p>Other polling shows relatively few Americans want to see Roe overturned. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 69% of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court should leave the Roe v. Wade decision as is; just 29% said the court should overturn the decision. In general, AP-NORC polling finds a majority of the public favors abortion being legal in most or all cases.</p>
<p>Still, when asked about abortion policy generally, Americans have nuanced attitudes on the issue, and many don&rsquo;t think that abortion should be possible after the first trimester or that women should be able to obtain a legal abortion for any reason.</p>
<p>Alito, in the draft, said the court can&#8217;t predict how the public might react and shouldn&#8217;t try. &ldquo;We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public&rsquo;s reaction to our work,&rdquo; Alito wrote in the draft opinion, according to Politico.</p>
<p>At arguments in December, all six conservative justices signaled that they would uphold the Mississippi law, and five asked questions that suggested that overruling Roe and Casey was a possibility.</p>
<p>Only Chief Justice John Roberts seemed prepared to take the smaller step of upholding the 15-week ban, though that too would be a significant weakening of abortion rights.</p>
<p>Until now, the court has allowed states to regulate but not ban abortion before the point of viability, around 24 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6128139/roe-wade-daughter-abortion/" >Jane Roe&#8217;s Oldest Daughter Talks About the Future of Roe v. Wade</a></em></p>
<p>The court&#8217;s three liberal justices seemed likely to be in dissent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to know what efforts are taking place behind the scenes to influence any justice&#8217;s vote. If Roberts is inclined to allow Roe to survive, he need only pick off one other conservative vote to deprive the court of a majority to overrule the abortion landmark.</p>
<p>Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas. The state&#8217;s law banning it after six weeks has already been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned.</p>
<p>Sixteen states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, have protected access to abortion in state law.</p>
<p>This year, anticipating a decision overturning or gutting Roe, eight conservative states have already moved to restrict abortion rights. Oklahoma, for example, passed several bills in recent weeks, including one that goes into effect this summer making it a felony to perform an abortion. Like many anti-abortion bills passed in GOP-led states this year, it does not have exceptions for rape or incest, only to save the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Seven Democratic-leaning states protected or expanded access to the procedure, including California, which has passed legislation making the procedure less expensive and is considering other bills to make itself an &ldquo;abortion sanctuary&rdquo; if Roe is overturned.</p>
<p>The draft looked legitimate to some followers of the court. Veteran Supreme Court lawyer Neal Katyal, who worked as a clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer and therefore has been in a position to see drafts, wrote on Twitter: &ldquo;There are lots of signals the opinion is legit. The length and depth of analysis, would be very hard to fake. It says it is written by Alito and definitely sounds like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian paid homage to one of the most iconic moments in American pop culture history at the <a href="https://time.com/6172286/met-gala-red-carpet-2022/" >2022 Met Gala</a> on Monday when she donned the same dress Marilyn Monroe famously wore to <a href="https://time.com/5354958/marilyn-monroe-john-f-kennedy-photo/" >sing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; to President John F. Kennedy</a> in 1962. The dress, a flesh-colored, figure-hugging column gown inspired by a Bob Mackie sketch for costume designer Jean-Louis, is covered in rhinestones and caused a sensation when Monroe revealed it, seemingly nude, after shedding her white fur to sing a sultry rendition of &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; to JFK at Madison Square Garden in front of an audience of nearly 15,000.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>For <a href="https://time.com/6072750/kardashians-blackfishing-appropriation/" >Kardashian</a>, this iconic glittering look was perfect for fashion&#8217;s biggest night, especially since the gala&#8217;s theme this year was Gilded Glamour. &#8220;What&rsquo;s the most American thing you can think of? And that&rsquo;s Marilyn Monroe,&rdquo; Kardashian said in an interview about the dress with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kim-kardashian-met-gala-2022"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vogue</em></a>. &ldquo;For me, the most Marilyn Monroe moment is when she sang &#8216;Happy Birthday,&#8217; to JFK, it was <em>that</em> look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night&#8217;s theme was inspired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s 2022 Costume Institute exhibit, <em>In America: An Anthology of Fashion</em>. Procuring Monroe&#8217;s original dress was no easy feat, however. To do it, Kardashian reached out to Ripley&#8217;s Believe It or Not Museum in Orlando, who bought the dress in 2016 in a $4.8 million sale that still <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-dress-sold-at-auction"  target="_blank">holds the record</a> for being the most expensive dress ever sold at auction.</p>

<p>Since the dress is such a precious part of history, plenty of precaution was taken as well. As the dress traveled, it was handled by guards and gloves. It couldn&#8217;t be altered, so Kardashian said she lost 16 pounds to fit into it. And on the night of the gala, she changed into the dress at the Met to minimize chances of harm, only wearing the real dress for the customary walk up the stairs of the museum, before changing into a replica of the gown once she reached the event.</p>
<p>Kardashian&#8217;s selection of Monroe&#8217;s dress for the night was not only an homage, but a surprisingly apropos move, a moment of real recognize real. Monroe was famously one of the most photographed women in the world during her heyday, while the brand of celebrity that Kardashian has pioneered relies on the omnipresence of her image. The dress&#8217;s night out at the Met Gala was only fitting.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://time.com/5831987/met-gala-2020/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Monday in May</a>, art and fashion enthusiasts alike ascended the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s stairs to celebrate <a href="https://time.com/5581241/met-gala-2019-camp-theme-explained-photos/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">fashion&#8217;s biggest night, the Met Gala</a>. This year&#8217;s gala theme, Gilded Glamour, provided ample fodder for creative interpretation as well as endless opportunities for fashion statements. The theme is a nod to the museum&#8217;s exhibit itself, <em>In America: An Anthology of Fashion.</em></p>
<p>Some attendees took a historical approach to their looks, including Sarah Jessica Parker who wore a sweeping Christopher John Rogers gown and Philip Treacy fascinator and Billie Eilish who donned a Gucci gown that was made entirely of existing materials for attire that was as sustainable as it was showstopping. Others took a more opulent interpretation of the theme, focusing on the glitz and richness of &#8220;Gilded,&#8221; like Cardi B&#8217;s Atelier Versace column gown made of jewelry and Lizzo&#8217;s gold embellished Thom Browne cape ensemble that she cheekily accessorized with her flute.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>For some, the city in which the event took place was inspiration enough&mdash;Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys both sported looks (his, a team jacket and snapback over a tux; hers, a sparkling gown and cape with the NYC skyline on it) designed by Ralph Lauren and inspired by their hometown of New York City, while gala co-chair Blake Lively wore an Atelier Versace gown that changed colors from bronze to aqua, symbolic of the the Statue of Liberty&#8217;s patina. For others, however, American pop culture was all that was needed to compose a striking outfit. Kim Kardashian closed out the red carpet arrivals in the <a href="https://time.com/6172809/kim-kardashian-marilyn-monroe-dress-met-gala-2022/" >dress that Marilyn Monroe famously wore</a> to sing &#8220;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&#8221; to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the best (and most outrageous) looks from the Met Gala red carpet.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://time.com/6171006/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile trial</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">involving actors Johnny Depp, 58, and his ex-wife Amber Heard, 36, entered its third week today, after kicking off April 12 in Fairfax County, Va.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has ignited a fierce fan reaction&mdash;and </span><a href="https://time.com/6172174/johnny-depp-tiktok-defenders/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken over TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;stems from a $50 million defamation lawsuit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed against Heard in 2019 in response to an </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she published in the Washington </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2018. Depp says the article irreparably damaged his career after Heard referred to herself in the piece as &ldquo;a public figure representing domestic abuse.&rdquo; The op-ed did not mention him by name. Depp believes it led to him being dropped from his lucrative role in Disney&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pirates of the Caribbean </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">franchise. In response to Depp&rsquo;s suit, Heard filed a $100 million countersuit arguing that Depp defamed her when his legal team referred to her claims as &ldquo;fake&rdquo; and a &ldquo;sexual violence hoax.&rdquo;</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<h2><strong>Agent Jack Whigham&rsquo;s testimony</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depp&rsquo;s agent Jack Whigham testified Monday that the op-ed was &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; to his client&#8217;s career,</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amber-heard-johnny-depp-arts-and-entertainment-caribbean-c25353ea7f4c0c9cfda1b8bcc66cc5cf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the AP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On cross-examination, Heard&rsquo;s lawyers argued that the op-ed was not the cause of the downturn in Depp&rsquo;s career, centering the blame instead on a stream of bad publicity brought about by Depp&rsquo;s own behavior. Whigham also testified that Depp was able to work after the op-ed, including multimillion-dollar roles in films such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">City of Lies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murder on the Orient Express, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although those contracts were all signed prior to the op-ed&rsquo;s publication. Whigham also claimed that what the AP called &ldquo;a $22.5 million verbal deal&rdquo; that Depp had with Disney for a sixth </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pirates</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> film disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the lawsuit is supposed to determine whether Depp was defamed by the article, the trial has surfaced many ugly details about the couple&rsquo;s brief marriage, including reports of volatile behavior by both parties. </span></p>
<h2>Security guard<strong> Travis McGivern&rsquo;s testimony</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another of those unsettling moments emerged today when Travis McGivern testified. McGivern was one of Depp&#8217;s security guards and, testifying via video, claimed to have witnessed Heard verbally and physically abuse the actor. During one alleged incident from 2015, McGivern claimed that he saw Heard &ldquo;throw a Red Bull can&rdquo; that hit Depp in the back. Another incident described by McGivern allegedly involved Heard throwing &ldquo;something else&mdash;either a purse or some sort of bag&rdquo; at Depp, which McGivern claimed to have blocked from hitting Depp. Heard also allegedly spat at Depp. McGivern alleged that while Depp did not retaliate the physical abuse, he &#8220;rearranged&#8221; Heard&#8217;s closet, throwing her belongings down a staircase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per McGivern, both actors engaged in what he described as &#8220;verbal vitriol.&#8221; &#8220;The F-word is my favorite word and it was being thrown around to the point where I was uncomfortable,&#8221; McGivern testified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGivern also testified that he saw </span><a href="https://time.com/6170866/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-borderline-personality-disorder/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heard&rsquo;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;closed fist&rdquo; hit Depp in the left side of his face. </span><a href="https://people.com/movies/johnny-depp-security-guard-testifies-he-saw-amber-heard-punch-actor/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he added that, &#8220;The initial look on [Depp&rsquo;s] face kind of mirrored mine, kind of a look of shock. Like, &#8216;What just happened? Where did that come from?&#8217; At that point, I wasn&#8217;t gonna let Mr. Depp get hit any more so I moved him down the last flight of stairs to the lower level and told him, &#8216;We are leaving.&#8217; It wasn&#8217;t up to him anymore. Just for his safety.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><b>What happens next</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heard is expected to take the stand on either Tuesday or Wednesday to testify and provide her own account of the relationship.</span></p>

<p>FLORENCE, Ala. &mdash; Authorities issued an arrest warrant Monday for a jail official who they say helped an inmate awaiting trial on a murder charge to escape from an Alabama jail. A search was on for the pair.</p>
<p>Inmate Casey Cole White, 38, was shackled and handcuffed when he and Vicky White, the facility&#8217;s assistant director of corrections, left the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence, Alabama, on Friday morning. They <a href="https://time.com/6172418/alabama-prison-official-missing/" >have not been seen since</a>, although the patrol vehicle that the pair used when leaving the detention center was found at a nearby shopping center parking lot after their absence was discovered.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Authorities have no idea where they are, although the inmate should be recognizable by his size. He stands 6 feet, 9 inches (2.06 meters) tall and weighs about 260 pounds. Authorities warned that anyone seeing the pair should not approach them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We consider both of them dangerous and in all probability, both individuals are armed,&#8221; U.S. Marshal Marty Keely said at a press conference Monday. He noted that Casey White &ldquo;will stand out&rdquo; because of his size even if he has changed his appearance.</p>
<p>Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Monday that they had issued an arrest warrant for Vicky White, 56, on charges of permitting or allowing an escape. She is not related to White.</p>
<p>She violated a policy that required more than one official to be involved in transporting him, according to Singleton. The policy was put in place when White was jailed two years ago and authorities believed he was planning to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know she participated, whether she did that willingly or if she was coerced, threatened somehow to participate in the case, not really sure. We know for sure she did participate,&rdquo; Singleton said.</p>
<p>Vicky White told co-workers she was taking him to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation. But Singleton later said no such evaluation was scheduled. He said video showed the pair left the jail and went straight to that parking lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Casey White, as you&rsquo;ve heard me say over and over and over is an extremely dangerous person and we need to get him located and get him off the street,&rdquo; Singleton said.</p>
<p>White was already serving a 75-year prison sentence for attempted murder, robbery and burglary when he disappeared. He had been brought back to the jail because of his latest charge. He was set to go to trial next month on a capital murder charge accusing him of stabbing a 58-year-old woman to death during a burglary in 2015. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service is offering up to $10,000 for information.</p>
<p>The sheriff said they were shocked by the events that transpired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the Vicky White we know, by any stretch of the imagination,&rdquo; the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Singleton said Vicky White had been an exemplary employee and jail employees are &ldquo;just devastated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vicky White had planned to retire and that Friday was to be her last day. He said she had sold her home about a month ago and &ldquo;talked about going to the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff said they had no leads at this point on where the two are located.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we knew where they were at, we would be there and not here,&rdquo; Singleton said.</p>
<p>As an assistant director for corrections, Vicky White moved throughout the county detention facility several times a day and had multiple opportunities every day to be in contact with any given inmate, the sheriff said. Her job duties also included coordinating transport of inmates.</p>
<p>Vicky White&#8217;s mother, Pat Davis, told <a href="https://www.waaytv.com/news/mother-pleas-for-missing-lauderdale-county-corrections-officer-to-come-home/article_9eee0cf6-c9c1-11ec-873e-b78cbceb6b06.html"  target="_blank">WAAY</a> that she is in shock and scared for her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a mother, I didn&rsquo;t know how to act because I thought at first it was a mistake. And then when I found out for sure it was, it was just disbelief,&rdquo; says Pat Davis. She told the station that &ldquo;we just want her back&rdquo; and found it difficult to believe her daughter would help an inmate escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s never done anything, I bet she&rsquo;s never even had a speeding ticket,&#8221; Pat Davis said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service said anyone with information about Casey White&rsquo;s location or Vicky White&rsquo;s disappearance can call the service at 1-800-336-0102. Anonymous tips may also be submitted through the U.S. Marshals Tip App.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic sparked a boom for video streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and Peacock. In 2020 and 2021, Netflix added </span><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/da27d24b-9358-4b5c-a424-6da061d91836.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">54.6 million subscribers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of them in the frightening, isolating six months after the world locked down and people sought entertainment in the safety of their homes. Now, that unprecedented wave of growth may be hitting its limits, as the company lost subscribers for the first time in its history, cut </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-layoffs-open-old-wounds-193400912.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around 25 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its marketing staff, and has begun piloting ways to crack down on <a href="https://time.com/6159943/netflix-password-sharing/" >sharing passwords</a>. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix&rsquo;s losses weren&rsquo;t simply theirs to bear. In the aftermath of Netflix&rsquo;s results, other streaming services have taken a hit&mdash;Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery, all of which run streaming services, saw their stock price drop as well. The same week that Netflix cut some of its marketing team, CNN+, the news service&rsquo;s foray into streaming, shuttered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all raises the question: Was the pandemic peak streaming, and we&rsquo;re now on a perpetual downward slope? On the heels of its April 19 letter to shareholders&mdash;where Netflix said it lost 200,000 subscribers instead of growing by millions as expected&mdash;the company</span><a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/NFLX/market_cap"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lost $60 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in market capitalization in just over a week. Netflix says it already expects to lose a further two million subscribers in the second quarter of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In 2020, people were locked at home and you couldn&rsquo;t do anything but watch TV,&rdquo; says Maria Rua Aguete, senior director of media and entertainment at London-based consultancy Omdia, which regularly analyzes the state of the streaming market. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural to go down after a boom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next question, then, is how streaming services will find their new normal, as user demographics change and the cost of basic needs continues to rise.</span></p>
<h2><b>Streaming is competing with YouTube and TikTok</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not just that pandemic viewing habits may be reverting. For one thing, viewers may be overwhelmed and exhausted by the plethora of services available, according to a Nielsen study&mdash;which found</span><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2022/state-of-play/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly half of users </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt that way, even if they generally like the ability to watch streaming video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The number of video streaming services in the U.S. has reached a ceiling,&rdquo; says Rua Aguete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there&rsquo;s a potential generational shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If there is a reckoning coming, it&#8217;s because all emerging data suggests millennials and Gen Z are not only less interested in streaming TV and film than the previous generation, they are also consuming more content on YouTube and TikTok,&rdquo; says Andrew A. Rosen, founder of streaming service analyst PARQOR, and a former Viacom executive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue was also noticed </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/summary.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by consulting firm Deloitte</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in its 2022 digital media trends survey. And for the first time, the most avid users of Netflix are likely to be </span><a href="https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/netflix-adds-more-older-viewers-as-younger-audiences-head-to-the-movies"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">those aged 24 to 44 in some markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rather than those aged 18 to 24, according to research firm Ampere. </span></p>
<h2><b>The cost of living is going up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Netflix broadens some of its account-sharing restrictions, it may be particularly hard on younger people who are </span><a href="https://time.com/6159943/netflix-password-sharing/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">used to sharing Netflix passwords</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&rsquo;s not just younger generations&mdash;cost of living increases are squeezing users of all ages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With gas and electricity bills going up massively, you almost worry about switching the TV on at all,&rdquo; says Emma Heath, 52, of Northampton, England, who recently cancelled Netflix, along with her satellite TV. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States inflation has </span><a href="https://moneyweek.com/economy/inflation/604444/cost-of-living-crisis-is-global-us-inflation-at-40-year-high"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit a 40-year high</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while the U.K. is doing little better, with inflation at a </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12196322"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30-year peak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rua Aguete says: &ldquo;Inflation is going up, the cost of living is going up. If in 2020, we took six or seven services, do we need them all now?&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As consumers grapple with higher costs for basics like food and fuel, services like Netflix are hiking prices. In January, Netflix told U.S. consumers that its standard two-screen service would rise to $15.49&mdash;the</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22993562/netflix-price-increase-us-plans-2022"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second price increase in two years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A similar increase in the U.K. followed shortly thereafter. Nearly four in 10 U.K. households say they plan to cancel a paid streaming video service, according to</span><a href="https://www.tvbeurope.com/media-delivery/kantar-cost-of-living-crisis-leads-to-record-numbers-cancelling-streaming-services"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">research by Kantar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors may add up to troubling news for streaming services trying to stand out among the crowd. Netflix rose to prominence by doing just that&mdash;with original hit shows like <em>Orange Is The New Black</em>, delivered ad-free. But now, Rosen says, the landscape has changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;To date, Netflix has driven a tightly constructed narrative around a subscription model only, and the objective of &lsquo;we want to entertain the world&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Rosen. &ldquo;Until the past two quarters, it has defied market concerns for its billions in debt that funded the content spending to pursue that objective.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix could not be reached for comment.</span></p>
<h2><b>What&rsquo;s next for Netflix and streaming</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix has said it&rsquo;s looking at an ad-supported tier that would cost less. &ldquo;Think of us as quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising as a consumer choice,&rdquo; Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings said on a conference call with analysts after the results were announced, though there was no formal indication in the shareholder&rsquo;s letter that the company would be pursuing an ad-supported model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should it decide to do so, Netflix would be following in the footsteps of many competitors who have introduced similar lower price points for consumers worried about cash. It&rsquo;s not all bad news, either: according to Omdia&#8217;s analysis, Hulu and Peacock have each managed to increase and maintain their average revenue per user by introducing a half-price, ad-supported option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Rua Aguete doesn&rsquo;t believe Netflix is losing its prominent place in the industry any time soon. In the Asia-Pacific region, Netflix posted subscriber gains that helped offset losses in the United States, Canada, and Europe. While the company&rsquo;s first quarter results were disappointing, and may signal the tide turning, they weren&rsquo;t necessarily terminal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s challenging times,&rdquo; says Rua Aguete. &ldquo;Things are not fantastic around the world, but yes, there is still growth in some countries.&rdquo; </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6172710"></div></div><br />

<p>Amazon warehouse workers overwhelmingly rejected a union bid on Monday, dealing a blow to organizers who last month pulled off the first successful U.S. organizing effort in the retail giant&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>This time around, warehouse workers cast 618 votes &mdash; or about 62% &mdash; against the union, giving <a href="https://time.com/4159144/amazon-prime-warehouse-new-york-city-deliveries-christmas/" >Amazon</a> enough support to fend off a second labor win and raise questions as to whether the first victory was just a fluke.</p>
<p>According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees the process, 380 workers &mdash; or 38% &mdash; voted in favor of the grassroots union. Turnout was about 61%, with about 1,600 workers eligible to vote, according to a voter list provided by Amazon.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The few ballots that were challenged by either Amazon or the ALU were not enough to sway the outcome. Both parties may file objections to the election by next Monday.</p>
<p>A separate election held last month gave <a href="https://www.amazonlaborunion.org/"  target="_blank">a nascent group of organizers</a> known as the Amazon Labor Union a surprise victory when workers at a different Staten Island facility voted in favor of unionizing. That was a first for Amazon in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/6169185/chris-smalls-amazon-labor-union/" ><em>He Came Out of Nowhere and Humbled Amazon. Is Chris Smalls the Future of Labor?</em></a></p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s defeat will surely sting. A second labor win was expected to fuel more organizing at the nation&#8217;s second largest employer, and cement the power and influence of the ALU.</p>
<p>But despite the momentum following the group&rsquo;s prior win, it was unclear if it could replicate its success. Organizers said they had lost some support at the warehouse after filing for an election in February because they directed more energy to the nearby facility that voted to unionize last month. There were also fewer organizers who worked in this facility &#8211; roughly 10, compared to the nearly 30 employed at the other warehouse.</p>
<p>The same obstacles that plagued the effort the first time, including Amazon&rsquo;s aggressive anti-union tactics, were at play again. In the lead-up to the election, Amazon continued to hold mandatory meetings to persuade its workers to reject the union effort, posted anti-union flyers and launched a website urging workers to &ldquo;vote NO.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, the ALU is trying to come between our relationship with you,&rdquo; a post on the website reads. &ldquo;They think they can do a better job advocating for you than you are doing for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel had said in a statement its employees choice whether or not they want to join a union. But &ldquo;as a company, we don&rsquo;t think unions are the best answer for our employees,&rdquo; Nantel said. &ldquo;Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless of the Monday&#8217;s outcome, it was bound to be a tough road ahead for the ALU. Amazon has disputed the first election, arguing in a filing with <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/"  target="_blank">the NLRB</a> that the vote was tainted by organizers and by the board&rsquo;s regional office in Brooklyn that oversaw the election. The company says it wants a redo election, but pro-union experts believe it&rsquo;s an effort to delay contract negotiations and potentially blunt some of the organizing momentum. A separate NLRB regional office in the Southwest will hold a hearing later this month over the company&rsquo;s objections.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the final outcome of <a href="https://time.com/5950288/amazon-union-vote-alabama/" >a separate union election in Bessemer, Alabama</a>, is still up in the air with 416 outstanding challenged ballots hanging in the balance. Hearings to review those ballots are expected to begin in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The debate over Elon Musk&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6170319/elon-musk-buys-twitter/" >acquisition of Twitter</a> is fierce because journalists and politicians depend on the platform to share their ideas and build their brands. Twitter is less than one-tenth the size of Facebook, and has been only intermittently profitable, which is a terrible result for one of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s most brilliant product ideas.</p>
<p>Those who have framed Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter as a disaster for democracy are not wrong, but they are eliding three important facts. First, internet platforms have been undermining our democracy since at least 2016. Second, politicians have failed in their duty to force accountability and <a href="https://time.com/5931597/internet-reform-democracy/" >reform of internet platforms</a>. Finally, journalism years ago embraced the &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; model of internet platforms, making the industry partially complicit in the harms.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>If the deal goes through&mdash;and that still seems likely&mdash;Musk has <a href="https://time.com/6170494/elon-musk-fix-twitter-plans/" >promised</a> to restore &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; to Twitter, which is code for reversing bans on users and reducing content moderation. Musk&rsquo;s framing is ridiculous. The First Amendment relates only to restriction of speech by the government. Corporations have always been free to set the rules on their platforms. A more valid complaint against internet platforms would be that their rules are ambiguous and are enforced inconsistently.</p>
<p>The real issue with Twitter&mdash;and with Musk&rsquo;s acquisition&mdash;relates to the business model. Like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and others, Twitter uses algorithms to amplify content that increases user engagement with the platform. The content that maximizes engagement best is that which provokes outrage and fear, namely hate speech, <a href="https://time.com/6171272/elon-musk-twitter-disinformation/" >disinformation</a>, and conspiracy theories. Such content triggers our involuntary flight or fight reflex; we cannot look away.</p>
<p>Amplifying harmful content for profit has serious consequences. It gives disproportionate political power to the most extreme voices. It enables bad actors to suppress other voices and harass those with whom they disagree, including marginalized communities that depend on Twitter to make themselves heard. Thanks to its central role in journalism and politics, Twitter has managed to subvert democracy without being a business success. No wonder many of its biggest users refer to Twitter as a &ldquo;hell site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have spent the past five years trying to warn policy makers, journalists, and the public about the threat posed by internet platforms to public health, democracy, the right to self-determination, and competition. In the time I have been an activist, we have witnessed more and bigger harms: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"  target="_blank">ethnic cleansing in Myanmar</a>, terrorism in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/29/facebook-new-zealand-christchurch-attack-response"  target="_blank">New Zealand</a> and the <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/multiple-threats-to-synagogues-in-wake-of-tree-of-life-shooting"  target="_blank">U.S.</a>, the radicalization of millions into QAnon, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/business/january-6-insurrection-facebook-papers/index.html"  target="_blank">insurrection</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/28/what-facebook-knew-about-covid-19-misinformation-didnt-tell-congress/"  target="_blank">undermining of the U.S. response to a pandemic</a>, all enabled by internet platforms. State attorneys general have investigated a wide range of issues, including some felonies. Teen bullying and suicides have spiked. Scams and criminal activities are widespread.</p>
<p>In 2016 and 2017, few people understood that Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google, and Twitter could cause widespread harm. Beginning with the <a href="https://time.com/5695252/christopher-wylie-cambridge-analytica-book/" >Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal in 2018, policy makers and journalists began to dig into the culture, business models, and algorithms of internet platforms. What they found was ugly, but the U.S. government did not take steps to force reform. Even the Trump insurrection and COVID-19 disinformation, two of the greatest threats to our country in a century, both enabled by the culture, business models, and algorithms of internet platforms, did not lead to meaningful reform.</p>
<p>Given the scale of harm from the Jan. 6 insurrection and <a href="https://time.com/6099700/covid-doctors-misinformation/" >misinformation around COVID-19</a>, one would expect the government of a functioning democracy to take action to protect its citizens and reform an industry clearly out of control. <a href="https://time.com/6121931/frances-haugen-facebook-whistleblower-profile/" >Whistleblowers</a> have shared mountains of evidence of harmful and sometimes criminal behavior by internet platforms, so there really is no excuse. And yet, no one in a position of power in the federal government has taken action to prevent further harm. Not the president. Not Congress. Not the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, or Securities and Exchange Commission. And voters have not insisted that they do so. Wall Street does not care about the harms so long as the stocks keep hitting new highs.</p>
<p>Journalists have done brilliant work to shine a light on the dangers of internet platforms, but the journalism industry has subverted that work by foregoing its traditional role as a counterweight to power and embracing the internet culture of engagement. Headlines and stories reflect the pursuit of attention. Deference to power, and especially to wealth, is pervasive.</p>
<p>A long series of policy failures and widespread indifference to catastrophic outcomes have allowed democracy to deteriorate to the point where the acquisition of a mediocre company by a billionaire might finish it off. For that, we the people deserve blame. We have not insisted that government and journalism work on our behalf. Instead we have allowed them to be coopted by the powerful.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Twitter itself. Blame for Twitter&rsquo;s failure to achieve greatness should be shared by the company&rsquo;s executives and the board of directors. Twitter could have been a bulwark of democracy. The founding management team created a brilliant product design, but they and their successors never developed a business model that allowed Twitter to take advantage of its potential. The board picked every one of those CEOs. When Jack Dorsey had the job, the board decided not to require that he be a full time CEO. (It is worth noting that they are selling Twitter to Elon Musk, who is already the CEO of Tesla and Space-X, and founder of two other companies.)</p>
<p>Every Twitter CEO has done essentially the same thing, expecting a different result. All the while, the board sat back and watched, confident that no one would call them out. Now they are selling the company to Musk, who has given no indication that he recognizes Twitter&rsquo;s role in democracy, much less has a plan to repair it.</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter is not a sure thing. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/27/technology/twitter-elon-musk-news"  target="_blank">already violated</a> a term of the deal by <a href="https://twitter.com/willoremus/status/1519392829704966144?s=21"  target="_blank">disparaging a Twitter executive</a>. If the deal goes through, it is possible Musk will make Twitter worse and that may help hasten the end of democracy as we know it. If that happens, it will be thanks to the accumulated damage done by Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube, and TikTok over the past six or seven years. For that, we all share the blame.</p>

<p><b><i>Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the final season of </i></b><b>Ozark</b></p>
<p><a href="https://time.com/5915528/best-movie-performances-2020/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Garner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apologizes for talking in the third person, but she swears it&rsquo;s the only way she can tell the story of how she learned her character Ruth Langmore&rsquo;s fate on the </span><a href="https://time.com/4865980/ozark-netflix-jason-bateman-review/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">final season of Netflix&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each season of the drama, which looks at how </span><a href="https://time.com/5375670/jason-bateman-ozark/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason&rsquo;s Bateman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s mild-mannered financial advisor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marty Byrde</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel, Garner meditates to center herself. &ldquo;I know this sounds crazy, but [while meditating] I try to remove myself completely and become Ruth,&rdquo; she told TIME. &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m half-asleep, half-awake [while doing this] so it&rsquo;s this subconscious-type thing and I ask myself, as Ruth, questions.&rdquo;</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the questions Garner asked Ruth as she prepared for the show&rsquo;s fourth and final season was what she was afraid of. &ldquo;She told me she was afraid to die,&rdquo; Garner says. &ldquo;Which was very weird because Ruth is never afraid to die. Ruth thinks she can handle anything.&rdquo; Less than a minute after finishing that unsettling meditation session, Garner got a phone call from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> producer Chris Mundy asking if they could talk about the final season. &ldquo;I said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I going to die?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He&rsquo;s like, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you know?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Honestly, I told him, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&rsquo;t know, but Ruth knew that she wasn&rsquo;t going to be an old lady</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second half of season 4, which is now streaming, begins with Ruth on a mission to murder Javi (Alfonso Herrera), the unhinged Mexican drug cartel leader who killed her cousin Wyatt (Charlie Tahan). It concludes with Javi&rsquo;s mom Camila (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veronica Falc&oacute;n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) shooting Ruth for taking her son&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s a bittersweet end for a beloved character who evolved from a small-time criminal into Marty&rsquo;s money laundering prot&eacute;g&eacute; and then into a legit businesswoman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the series felt like a transformative experience for Garner, who also stars in </span><a href="https://time.com/6147320/inventing-anna-wardrobe-costume-designer-interview/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix&rsquo;s hit series </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventing Anna</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not just a page in my book, it&rsquo;s chapters of it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a job. It&rsquo;s a part of me.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the final season started streaming, Garner spoke to TIME about filming her final </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scene, becoming </span><a href="https://time.com/6147088/inventing-anna-true-story/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">real-life scammer Anna Delvey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and why she thinks the Byrdes will never win. </span></p>
<p><b>You </b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZAl_QRvJAj/"  target="_blank"><b>finished filming </b><b><i>Ozark</i></b></a> <b>in January. How are you feeling now that fans will finally learn Ruth&rsquo;s fate?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s really bittersweet. From an artistic point of view, I feel like ending on a high note like this is probably the smartest move. You don&rsquo;t ever want to be the last person leaving the party. Personally, and selfishly, I could shoot this show until I&rsquo;m 70 years old. I know that every actor promoting their project always says, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a family</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But this was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">like a family. [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laughs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] Jason [Bateman], </span><a href="https://time.com/5811333/laura-linney-ozark-my-name-is-lucy-barton/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura [Linney]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and everybody on the show is so talented and respects each other artistically and personally. It was a dream. It was such a personal experience. It makes it harder in some ways to be on other sets because I have this sort of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> standard in a way.</span></p>

<p><b>What has been the hardest part of saying goodbye to Ruth?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It almost feels like a part of me has died in a way. Ruth gave me so much, not only as an actor but also as a person. She gave me a sense of confidence that I didn&rsquo;t have before. She gave me that. It&rsquo;s weird because in the middle of filming I have more in common with my character than with myself. I&rsquo;ll wonder, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I feeling like this?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I&rsquo;ll think about it and go, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, because my character is feeling that way</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Does that make any sense?</span></p>
<p><b>Like that barrier between your true self and the version of you that people see on screen is less defined when you&rsquo;re filming?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird. Emotions are contagious. When [Ruth&rsquo;s cousin] Wyatt died [in the season 4 part 1 finale], I think a part of Ruth died. She was physically alive, but her soul died. Not to get really depressing, but that was my mindset for a year [while preparing and filming the final season]. It was very depressing to feel like that, but that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so amazing on set. Because everybody was so light and wonderful that it made it easier to wake up the next morning knowing that you&rsquo;re surrounded by people who love you.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you talk about filming Ruth&rsquo;s final scene?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt like I was dying. My death was also the last scene of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think the last shot we did was me on the ground. I really do think Ruth died when Wyatt died. I think her body was just here. She wasn&rsquo;t going to voluntarily quit life, but I think she was so dead inside that if given an opportunity to die, she wouldn&rsquo;t say no. In the end, it&rsquo;s not her going over to death, it&rsquo;s death coming over to her. By the end of the season, she didn&rsquo;t care about living. She did what she needed to do, she killed Javi, and after that mission, she was like a ghost.</span></p>
<p><b>Ruth loses her life, but the Byrdes seem to have it all. They found a way to go straight while still breaking bad. Do you think the Byrdes won? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t view it as the Byrdes winning, even if they think they&rsquo;re winning. I think they&rsquo;re lying to themselves. They might have won the battle, but they didn&rsquo;t win the war. When you get your hands that dirty, they can never be clean. People are not meant to do things like they&rsquo;ve done, you know? I think of the simplicity of an animal: they love, they fight, they have sex, they hate. People are like that, but the only difference is that people have money and that makes people less simple, because money is never simple.</span></p>

<p><b>On paper, your </b><a href="https://time.com/6149027/super-pumped-inventing-anna-docudramas/" ><b><i>Inventing Anna</i></b></a><b> character, </b><a href="https://time.com/6160306/con-artist-books/" ><b>scam artist Anna Delvey</b></a><b>, and Ruth couldn&rsquo;t be more different, but do you think those characters have anything in common?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&rsquo;re both ruthless women. People are very attracted to people, specifically women, that have a ruthless way about them. That&rsquo;s a sense of confidence, and there&rsquo;s nothing more attractive than having full ownership of yourself.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you think Anna and Ruth would be friends?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think in the beginning they would judge each other, like, hardcore. Anna is such a girl&rsquo;s girl, but Ruth is not. I think Ruth always longs to have that female validation and kind of secretly wants to be a part of the girl&rsquo;s club in a way, but she only knows how to talk to men. She&rsquo;s like a bossy girl on the playground bossing all the boys basically. But then they would realize that they could team up, like, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, you like surprising people? I also like surprising people. Let&rsquo;s surprise people together! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laughs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] </span></p>
<p><b>Many have questioned whether Anna ever felt remorse for what she did. After spending a bit of time with her in preparation for </b><b><i>Inventing Anna</i></b><b>, what do you think? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I view that whole story like it was a trauma for everybody. I think it&rsquo;s a trauma for </span><a href="https://time.com/6146419/inventing-anna-rachel-williams-anna-delvey/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel [Williams]</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Anna&rsquo;s lawyer [Todd Spodek], [journalist] </span><a href="https://time.com/5671735/hustlers-movie-true-story/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Pressler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I also think it&rsquo;s a trauma for Anna Delvey. So for me, [the question of], </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have sympathy for her?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That&rsquo;s black and white. A trauma is a trauma, and every single person in the world has a trauma. It might not seem like a trauma to us, but we&rsquo;re not in that person&rsquo;s shoes. I play people, I don&rsquo;t play caricatures, and as soon as you play a caricature it&rsquo;s going to be one-note and one-dimensional. I mean Ruth killed her uncles in season 1 [of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ozark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] and people forget about that because it was an ongoing series. There was more time for people to forgive that character. You could have said that Ruth was a sociopath, but no one&rsquo;s saying that. People don&rsquo;t have to like the characters that I play. I just want them to be open to understanding that person.</span></p>
<p><b>Anna has seen and </b><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cosmopolitan/video/7070961901441944878?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fuk%2Fentertainment%2Fa39406873%2Fanna-delvey-reacts-inventing-anna%2F&amp;referer_video_id=7070961901441944878&amp;refer=embed"  target="_blank"><b>shared her opinion</b></a><b> on</b><b><i> Inventing Anna </i></b><b>since it premiered in February. Has she reached out to you to talk about the show?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I haven&rsquo;t heard from her personally. I remember when I first met up with her, she asked me how I was going to play her. I told her, &lsquo;My job is not for me to make people like you or hate you.&rsquo; At that time, she had no voice at all. I said to her, &lsquo;My job is for people to be willing to understand why you did what you did. Whether it&rsquo;s good or bad. I&rsquo;m not saying what you did and how you went about it is a good thing, but I want people to be willing to question how you got to that place and why. That&rsquo;s going to humanize you because right now, people are not viewing you like a human and you are. I want to remind people of that.&rsquo; I think that meant a lot to her. </span></p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA &mdash; A fired Philadelphia police officer has been charged with murder in the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/arrests-philadelphia-199e5ac728895ad80a6d443efb988707"  target="_blank">shooting</a> of a fleeing 12-year-old boy, who prosecutors said Monday was on the ground and unarmed when the officer fired the fatal shot.</p>
<p>Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner announced first- and third-degree murder charges against former Officer Edsaul Mendoza in the shooting of Thomas &ldquo;T.J.&rdquo; Siderio on March 1 after police allege the youth fired a shot at an unmarked police car, injuring one of four plainclothes officers inside.</p>
<p>Mendoza was also charged with voluntary manslaughter and other charges, according to a grand jury presentment unsealed Monday. He had been suspended from his job March 8 with intent to fire.</p>
<p>Court records show Mendoza surrendered Sunday and was denied bail in a rare move for former law enforcement officers facing charges.</p>
<p>A spokeperson for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 said the union plans to provide an attorney for the officer. Court records showed the public defender&#8217;s office represented Mendoza at his bail hearing Monday. The defender&#8217;s association didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.</p>
<p>New details of the shooting were revealed in the unsealed grand jury documents Monday, including that Siderio had thrown a gun down about 40 feet before he was shot and that the youth had dropped to the ground, either tripping or obeying a command to get down. Krasner said the officer crossed between two parked cars and from about a half-car length away, fired the fatal shot.</p>
<p>Krasner said much of the evidence was based on a video that has not been publicly released.</p>
