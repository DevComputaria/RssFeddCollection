<p>VLADIMIR Putin has VIOLATED ceasefires leaving Ukrainian wounded soldiers &#8216;dying in agony&#8217;, a Ukrainian commander has said.  </p>



<p>The Deputy <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> commander has  also accused the Russian troops of preventing evacuations of civilians from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18461587/russia-blitzes-mariupol-steel-plant-thermobaric-missiles/">Mariupol steelworks.</a></p>



<p>In a video posted on&nbsp;Telegram, Capt Sviatoslav Palamar said: “It’s day three since the enemy entered the Azovstal factory, where heavy, bloody fighting continues”.</p>



<p>“Yet again, the Russians have broken their promises of a ceasefire and did not allow the evacuation of civilians who continue to shelter from the shelling in the factory’s basements.</p>



<p>“Our enemy observes no ethical norms, conventions or laws”.</p>



<p>The news comes as, Putin’s forces have practised nuclear missile strikes and chemical attacks in chilling war games on NATO’s border.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Moscow</a> confirmed its troops ran simulated nuclear missile strikes in the western enclave of Kaliningrad on Wednesday amid heightening tensions over the war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The announcement came on the 70th day of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Mad Vlad</a>‘s blundering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">invasion of Ukraine</a>&nbsp;which has seen thousands killed and more than 13 million displaced in the worst refugee crisis in Europe since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/">World War Two.</a></p>

<p><strong>RUSSIAN soldiers taunted women fleeing the horror of bomb-blitzed Mariupol by threatening to murder their husbands and send them their heads in a box.</strong></p>



<p>Some of the wives and girlfriends of the city’s heroic defenders escaped from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18461587/russia-blitzes-mariupol-steel-plant-thermobaric-missiles/">Azovstal</a> “Alamo” on a UN and Red Cross mercy mission.</p>

<p>But they were stopped and ordered to strip at multiple checkpoints where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18463955/putin-war-captured-russian-troops/">Russian troops</a> hurled abuse, one told news website Ukrainian Pravda.</p>



<p>Katia, who escaped with two children, said: “Women who had acquaintances serving in the Ukrainian military or the police were threatened.</p>



<p>“They were promised that they would be sent their husband’s head in a box. </p>



<p>&#8220;We were undressed, any scars and tattoos were checked, and women’s underpants were searched.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the besieged <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18452619/russia-storm-azovstal-steel-plant/">Azovstal steel plant’s</a> last defenders appealed to their chain of command to get wounded comrades to safety.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> invaders were said to have breached the perimeter following a devastating air, land and sea bombardment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/">The Kremlin</a> denied it was an attempt to storm the plant, saying the bombings were to prevent the defenders moving to new positions.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> troops launched counter attacks around Kharkiv and the city of Izyum where Russians are trying to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">build up forces</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RUSSIAN hackers have threatened to shut down British hospital ventilators after an alleged member of their cyber crime gang was arrested in the UK.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> cheerleader based in London was held after a police raid on Monday, following a high-tech assault on government websites in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/romania/">Romania</a>.</p>

<p>His alleged comrades from the sinister <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> group Killnet last night warned they would disable life-saving ventilators across the UK if he is not released.</p>



<p>The suspect has previously crowed of his support for Russia’s invasion of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> in Facebook posts emblazoned with Russian flags and the letter “Z”, the invasion symbol daubed on Russian tanks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18463351/britains-most-wanted-captured-armed-cops-portugal/">National Crime Agency</a> cops and officers flown in from Romania swooped on an address in London for the raid. </p>



<p>The Putin fan was arrested under suspicion of assisting Killnet’s attacks, which were staged earlier this week on the Romanian government and media in retribution for supporting Ukraine in the conflict.</p>



<p>Killnet claimed responsibility for the hacks, which jammed the official government webpage and the defence ministry. Political parties, cultural organisations and companies were also targeted.</p>

<p>The group’s leaders went online to claim the arrested suspect had nothing to do with their action — but threatened to target NHS ventilators if he was not released within 48 hours.</p>



<p>Cyber crime sources close to the investigation warned last night that the threat was credible.</p>

<p>The warning, posted on the Telegram messaging site, threatened: “If he is not released within 48 hours I will destroy your Romania, Great Britain and Moldova.</p>



<p>“I will destroy your entire information structure and even your Ministry of Health.</p>



<h3 id="appropriate-response">&#8216;Appropriate response&#8217;</h3>



<p>“All ventilators will be attacked. Only then will you begin to realise the mistake you have made.”</p>



<p>The rant, from the group’s leader, was signed off with a black heart emoji beside a Russian flag.</p>



<p>The suspect had already been released under investigation when the threat was posted, but it is believed the group could carry out an attack if the case is pursued.</p>



<p>Analysts fear life-threatening cyber attacks by Russian tech terrorists could help trigger <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-3/">World War Three</a>.</p>



<p>Thousands of ventilators in hospitals across the UK still remain vital in the battle to keep seriously ill <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid</a> patients alive.</p>



<p>If Killnet’s links to the Russian state are proven, the attack against Romania or any action against the UK could technically trigger a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a> military response.</p>

<p>ROBYN Curnow made a name for herself as a member of the CNN staff. </p>



<p>In May 2022, she updated fans on her career and revealed a shocking change. </p>

<h2 id="is-robyn-curnow-leaving-cnn-international">Is Robyn Curnow leaving CNN International?</h2>



<p>On May 3, 2022, Curnow took to Instagram, where she released a statement about her career. </p>



<p>In the statement, she revealed that she would be leaving <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17524766/inside-cnn-controversies-ceo-jeff-zucker-resigns-chris-cuomo/">CNN</a> after two decades on television. </p>



<p>&#8220;So, yes, I’m walking away,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CdFskmlOffX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she wrote</a>. &#8220;20 years as&nbsp;#CNN&nbsp;[correspondent] and anchor. And I’ve decided it’s time to change. This is my decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m excited for the plans I’ve been cooking up recently,&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mostly, at this moment when I reflect on my career, I feel profound thanks to all my CNN colleagues and friends around the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;God, it’s been fun. XxxxR,&#8221; she concluded. </p>



<p>At this time, it remains unclear what Curnow will do in the future. </p>

<p>A RUSSIAN yoga influencer faces up to six YEARS in jail and a £55,000 fine after posing completely naked for a photo shoot under a sacred tree in Bali.</p>



<p>Instagram star Alina Yoga shared pictures of her pushing her boobs up against the tree in Indonesia on her popular social media account.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18475242" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 10px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730801091.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18475242" width="960" height="709" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_18475456" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 641px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/94b1678b-8cab-4104-820f-8b01af820570-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=631" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18475456" width="631" height="753" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Alina posed completely starkers under the sacred tree in Bali, Indonesia</figcaption><figcredit>ViralPress</figcredit></figure>



<p>But the saucy snaps soon found their way to Balinese entrepreneur Niluh Djelantik who grassed her up and called on the local authorities to intervene.</p>



<p>Djelantik said the Russian beauty had posed naked at the 700-year-old weeping paperbark tree, known locally as kayu putih.</p>



<p>Now the bendy influencer &#8211; who has over 16,000 followers on Instagram &#8211; could face up to six years in jail if she&#8217;s found guilty under local porn laws.</p>



<p>The photos show her perched on the trunk absolutely starkers as she looks cheekily over her shoulder.</p>

<p>The tree is located at Babakan Temple in Tabananm on the Indonesian paradise island of Bali.</p>



<p>And because the giant tree is considered sacred to locals, the nude images sparked fury.</p>



<p>Fuming Djelantik said immigration officials are now tracking down the naked Russian.</p>



<p>Amid a backlash, Alina deleted the nude snaps from her account and posted a U-turn apology video on May 4.</p>

<p>The new video &#8211; this time showing her fully clothed and praying at the base of the sacred tree &#8211; was accompanied by the message: “I apologise to all Balinese and Indonesian people, I regret my actions.&#8221;</p>



<p>She went on: &#8220;I&#8217;m so embarrassed, I didn&#8217;t mean to offend you in any way, absolutely no knowledge of this place.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just prayed under a tree and went straight to the police station to explain this incident and apologise.”</p>



<p>Tabanan Police spokesperson Ranefli Dian Candra confirmed that Alina had turned herself over to the authorities and that the case will continue to be processed.</p>



<p>But they did not mention what punishment the naked Instagram star is likely to face.</p>



<p>According to reports, Alina could be charged with spreading pornography under the country’s harsh Information and Electronic Transactions Act (ITE).</p>



<p>If convicted of spreading pornography, she could face up to six years in prison or a fine of IDR 1 billion (£55,432).</p>



<p>It follows a similar incident where a Russian porn star wanted by police in Bali after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14837126/russian-hides-out-sex-bali-mountain/">filming herself having SEX</a> on a sacred mountain is in hiding in Russia.</p>



<p>A video clip posted online show Veronika Troshina, 22, with her pet cat in St Petersburg and nearby Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>THE head of Britain&#8217;s Armed Forces has said that a humiliated Vladimir Putin is running out of missiles trying to defeat Ukraine.</p>



<p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin claimed that the Russian president could be running low on armaments due to firing more than expected on the brave Ukrainians.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18473592" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730820141.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18473592" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Talk TV</figcredit></figure>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin claimed that Russia have now lost 25 per cent of all its forces in Ukraine[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18473591" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000727451038.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18473591" width="960" height="665" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Sir Tony believes Vladimir Putin is running out of missiles as a result of the Ukraine invasion[/caption]



<p>He also claimed that Russia have now lost 25 per cent of all its forces in Ukraine and are &#8220;struggling&#8221; to get any momentum in the Donbas region.</p>



<p>It comes after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18444745/vladimir-putin-killed-coup-spy-bosses-ukraine/">reports that senior figures</a> in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> army and security services have become increasingly frustrated with the sickly tyrant&#8217;s handling of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war.</a></p>



<p>Sir Tony believes that Putin underestimated Ukraine before he ordered the initial Russian offensive.</p>



<p>He said to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/talk-tv/">TalkTV</a>: &#8220;He potentially has a problem, because the rate of expenditure and the toughness of the fight is totally different to the one that he perceived on the 24th of February. </p>

<p>“I think there are several wars going on. There&#8217;s a tactical, geographical war going on in Ukraine. There&#8217;s a logistics war going on, in terms of how do you maintain that rate of expenditure. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re talking severe impact on their armed forces. We’ve had 25% of their forces effectively being taken out &#8211; either through people being killed, or through the damage to their battalion tactical groups.” </p>



<p>And after the Russian invasion has stalled in recent weeks, Sir Tony argued that Putin is under &#8220;incredible pressure&#8221; to pull off a victory in the Donbas region.</p>



<p>He said: “I think what we&#8217;re now seeing is incredible pressure &#8211; political pressure and military pressure &#8211; for a victory. </p>

<p>&#8220;And I think we&#8217;ve got to wait and see whether or not doing that in such a rushed manner against a Ukrainian armed forces that are fighting for their country.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And that should give all of us encouragement about how this is going to be a tough fight. This is going to be a hard slog.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re seeing the tactical fight, where he&#8217;s trying to rush to a tactical victory, and then he&#8217;ll push that with his own people”.</p>



<p>The Admiral went on to give his assessment on some home issues, claiming that the &#8220;impact of inflation&#8221; may lead to fresh defence cuts.</p>

<p>Sir Tony said: &#8221; That&#8217;s a conversation that we need to have in a much bigger way. A taking stock of what is the impact of this? What is the impact of Russia&#8217;s aggression?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And then if you ask me as a selfish military officer, could we provide more to the nation in terms of its security with additional spending? Then of course, that&#8217;s something that I would welcome.”</p>

<p>It was claimed a car had stopped to let her cross when the rented buggy zoomed past it and ploughed into her.</p>

<p>Camilla was taken to hospital in Famagusta but could not be saved.</p>



<p>Social workers and a child psychologist were looking after the victim&#8217;s young daughter until her father arrived on the island.</p>

<p>Police told KNEWS neither the Brit driver or his passenger were injured in the incident.</p>

<p>The Brit&#8217;s photo was released to local media and an arrest warrant was issued.</p>



<p>He was tracked down hours later and hauled in front of a judge today.</p>



<p>He was ordered to be held in custody for six days as the investigation continues.</p>

<p>TERRIFYING video shows a dad shooting a cigarette out of his son&#8217;s mouth with an AK-47.</p>



<p>The horrifying clip, said to be filmed in southern <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iraq/">Iraq</a>, showed the unidentified father as he used the child as target practice.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18472661" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 578px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730809593.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=568" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18472661" width="568" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>The young boy was filmed as his father shot a cigarette out of his mouth[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18472660" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 563px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730767559.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=553" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18472660" width="553" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Calls have grown for the dad to be investigated after the terrifying footage emerged online[/caption]



<p>According to reports, the man &#8211; from the governorate of Al Muthanna &#8211; told his son to hold the cigarette in his mouth so he could show off his sniping skills.</p>



<p>In the video, the boy is seen standing in front of the camera with his chin raised and the cigarette thrust up into the sky from his mouth.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, his dad walks towards the far end of the courtyard with a rifle in his hand before taking a sitting position on the ground.</p>



<p>He takes aim as his son tries to remain as still as possible before pulling the trigger.</p>



<p>The stunned youngster flinches at the noise and then removes the ciggie from his mouth, showing it to the camera before his dad brags about his accuracy.</p>



<p>After the video was widely shared online, social media users expressed their horror and called on local authorities to take action, with some claiming it should be treated as attempted murder.</p>



<p>The calls come just five years after a bungling sharpshooter attempting a similarly gruesome experiment as he tried to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3408947/man-tries-shoot-cigarette-hit-womans-fingers-video/">hit a cigarette out of a woman’s hand.</a></p>



<p>Footage showed the relaxed &#8220;assistant&#8221; holding a lit cig between her digits as a target for his rifle.</p>

<p>But the gunslinger’s 22 pellet, fired from close range, appeared to hit the woman&#8217;s fingers and left her screaming and covered in blood.</p>



<p>In 2018, a wrongly calculated YouTube prank proved fatal when a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5816014/youtube-monalisa-perez-jailed-shooting-dead-boyfriend-stunt-viral/">woman shot her boyfriend dead</a> in front of their three-year-old daughter in a stunt they hoped would go viral.</p>



<p>Monalisa Perez believed partner Pedro Ruiz would be shielded by a thick book as she blasted him from close range.</p>



<p>However, after shooting her boyfriend with a Desert Eagle pistol, described as &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s most powerful semiautomatic handguns,&#8221; he tragically died on the spot. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, Perez told a sheriff’s deputy that it was Ruiz who had been pushing his idea for the video, which was recorded by one camera on the back of a parked vehicle and another on a ladder.</p>

<p>Local reports said the unnamed woman had been at her home on a residential estate called Urbanizacion Torre Azul between Elche and the nearby town of Torrellano.</p>



<p>Police are understood to have increased patrols in the area and the property has been cordoned with police tape.</p>



<p>Worried neighbours are thought to have called police when they found her body after a plumber went round for an arranged visit and got no answer when he knocked on the front door.</p>



<p>Well-placed sources have said the victim had lived alone for several years after the death of her husband.</p>

<p>It is not yet clear if her next-of-kin have been informed.</p>



<p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/">Spain</a>’s National <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/">Police</a> confirmed: “We are investigating the death of a British woman who was shot dead at a property in Elche. We are investigating it as a murder and can confirm she was shot dead.</p>



<p>“The alarm was raised around 6.30pm yesterday/on Wednesday.<br>“She was 80 years old and lived alone.</p>



<p>“No arrests have yet been made and the investigation is ongoing. We are not in a position to discuss the possible motive at this stage.”</p>



<p>A source close to the investigation said the possibility she was shot by intruders in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/">violent burglary</a> had not been ruled out.</p>



<p>However, one local unconfirmed report said investigators were not satisfied that was the case from initial inquiries.</p>



<p>Police have not confirmed if anything was missing from the crime scene.</p>



<p>The gunshot wounds the victim suffered are thought to have been fired from close range, and had been killed shortly before she was found dead.</p>



<p>One neighbour told Spanish press two strangers &#8211; he assumed to be a couple &#8211; dressed in black had been seen walking on the residential estate on Wednesday afternoon but was unable to offer any more information.</p>



<p>He said: “I wasn’t able to leave my house yesterday because I’ve got a problem with my leg. The dead woman lived alone. I knew her from sight.”</p>



<p>But the plumber who called police when he couldn’t raise the victim also confirmed a sighting of a couple leaving the property as he arrived.</p>



<p>The mystery man and woman are said to have driven off in a black Peugeot 207 or 208.</p>



<p>Spanish radio station SER said the man had a beard and the woman was dressed in black and both wore hoodies and were using face masks.</p>



<p>A spokesman for Spain’s National Police said: “We are aware of these reports but it is nothing we can comment on at the moment.</p>



<p>“We are keeping an open mind on the motive although we can confirm the fatal shooting is being treated as a murder at this stage.</p>



<p>“Suicide has been ruled out.”</p>



<p>A post-mortem is due to take place in Alicante in the coming hours.</p>



<p>The £350,000 detached villa where the shooting occurred is on a residential estate of around 250 to 300 houses which is home to Spaniards as well as foreign nationals including Brits and Germans.</p>



<p>One local, who asked not to be named, described the dead woman as someone “with a strong character who was not afraid to speak her mind.”</p>



<p>She is thought to have run-ins with some neighbours over the amount of noise she claimed they made.</p>



<p>Although detectives have confirmed she was British, she is understood to be a naturalised British citizen who was born outside the UK.</p>

<p>Her husband, who is understood to have been British, is thought to have died several years ago from cancer.</p>



<p>One local report said she had been born in Holland, although a neighbour said she was born in Germany before acquiring British citizenship years ago through marriage to her late husband.</p>

<p><strong>VLADIMIR Putin&#8217;s death could trigger a scenario that allows bad actors to get their hands on nuclear weapons amid political chaos in Moscow, experts fear.</strong></p>



<p>Rumors about the <a href="https://the-sun.com/where/russia">Russian</a> tyrant’s ailing health have surfaced for months as reports claim that he could transfer power to a former spy while he undergoes surgery.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18471733" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000728865296.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18471733" width="960" height="626" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Rumors have surfaced for months that Russian president Vladimir Putin&#8217;s health is deteriorating[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18471734" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000728986153-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18471734" width="960" height="621" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Experts fear that nuclear weapons could get into the hands of bad actors in a post-Putin Russia amid political chaos. Pictured: Russia&#8217;s &#8216;Satan 2&#8217; nuclear missile[/caption]



<p>Kremlin loyalist Nikolai Patrushev, 70, has been touted as a potential replacement &#8211; but it&#8217;s not known who succeeds Putin if he becomes incapacitated or dies. </p>



<p>Russian expert Taras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, revealed there will be &#8220;infighting at the top of the Kremlin over who will be the one to take over&#8221;. </p>



<p>Experts have speculated that Russia could strengthen its relationship with the East, or become a failed state in a post-Putin world. </p>





<h2 id="challenge-to-the-us"><strong>CHALLENGE TO THE US</strong></h2>



<p>Geopolitical expert Brandon J Weichert warned that a savvier figure could succeed Putin and a future Russian state could potentially form an authoritarian axis with China.</p>



<p>The axis could become so powerful that it threatens the western ideals of democracy and freedom, posing a challenge to the US.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17881415/china-russia-alliance-ukraine-war-explained/">China hasn’t formally endorsed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,</a> but Beijing and Moscow have signed cooperation agreements in the financial sector and on the supply of gas.</p>



<p>Beijing and Moscow conducted joint military drills and signed a  military cooperation pact last year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the ruble has rebounded to pre-war levels as it strengthened its position against the dollar &#8211; despite crippling sanctions imposed on the Russian economy by the West.</p>



<p>Weichert warned: “A long-term disconnection from the Western economic system may make Russia stronger, more independent, and more durable.</p>

<p>“The West used the economic nuclear option against Russia (sanctions) but in the long run, they could adapt, fight and overcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a post-Putin world, Russia could deepen its ties with China, according to Weichert.</p>



<p>He explained: Members of the Siloviki (Putin&#8217;s inner circle) have always favored trying to bring Russia closer to Asia.</p>



<p>“It’s a self-defense mechanism away from totally suffering economically and financially, particularly, in the wake of western sanctions.</p>



<p>“They think it’s better to have a relationship with the East than a hostile one, especially as the West isn’t interested in being Russia&#8217;s friend.”</p>



<p>There would be an evolution of authoritarianism if China and Russia deepen their relations, Weichert says.</p>



<h2 id="authoritarian-axis">AUTHORITARIAN AXIS</h2>



<p>A new Russian state could form relations with Iran, North Korea, and Syria &#8211; potentially creating a Eurasian alliance.</p>



<p>Then, Latin American states such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17438792/russian-invasion-ukraine-trigger-world-war-3/">may be absorbed into the alliance.</a></p>



<p>Research fellow Isabel Sawkins, of the Henry Jackson Society, said: &#8220;There’s a history of relationships between the Soviet Union and Latin America.&#8221;</p>



<p>A future Russian state’s relationship with China would begin with loose cooperation before Beijing would become the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221;,  according to Weichert.</p>



<p>He said: “Moscow may be the muscle as it has the hard military capability but Beijing would be the brains.</p>



<p>&#8220;The West could be creating a Frankenstein&#8217;s monster.</p>



<p>“But, ultimately Russia would become a vassal state of China’s new empire.&#8221;</p>



<p>Weichert said a post-Putin Russia-China partnership would look similar to the relationship between Moscow and Belarus.</p>



<h2 id="hardliner-takes-over-1">NO COHESION</h2>



<p>Weichert explained that Putin’s successor will have to be respected if they want to consolidate power.</p>



<p>He said: “The only one who might be able to hold it together is Patrushev but he’s not a spring chicken.</p>



<p>“At some point, they will run out of people who are competent and capable enough to run the country.”</p>



<p>Excluding Patrushev, Weichert fears there isn’t anyone that can command the same level of respect as Putin.</p>



<p>But, Kuzio doesn&#8217;t believe Russia would collapse and splinter into different republics.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Russia&#8217;s more likely to return to what it was like in the 1990s &#8211; a chaotic and failed state where regional governments didn&#8217;t listen to Moscow.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="weapons-in-wrong-hands"><strong>WEAPONS IN WRONG HANDS</strong></h2>



<p>Weichert fears that multiple power centers would emerge if Putin&#8217;s successor is unable to maintain cohesion.</p>



<p>He warned that it may provide an opportunity for organized crime groups to try and exploit.</p>



<p>Weichert said: “They would try to jockey and gain power like a Game of Thrones situation where the strong king is gone and all the others are trying to use their influence to get to the number one spot.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the 1990s, western leaders feared nuclear weapons and WMDs could end up in the hands of authoritarian regimes following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>



<p>The US and its allies formed the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to &#8220;secure and dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in the former Soviet Union states&#8221;. </p>



<p>Around 30,000 nukes were spread over four countries when the USSR collapsed.</p>



<p>And, at least 40,000 tons of chemical weapons were present, according to the <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-the-nunn-lugar-cooperative-threat-reduction-program-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arms Control Center.</a></p>



<p>If the Russian state collapses and a similar program doesn&#8217;t exist, Weichert fears nukes could end up in the hands of terrorist groups.</p>



<p>In post-Putin Russia, military or intelligence leaders that have access to weapon systems may want to enhance their power or make money.  </p>



<p>Weichert fears officials could use those missile systems as leverage.</p>



<p>They would be sold to the highest bidder and flogged potentially on the black market.</p>



<h2 id="putin-s-demise"><strong>&#8216;PUTIN&#8217;S DEMISE&#8217;</strong></h2>



<p>Kuzio predicts that Ukraine will win the war by the end of 2022 or the start of 2023, ultimately leading to Putin&#8217;s demise.</p>



<p>He claims western governments believe that if they continue to supply weapons to Kyiv and it leads to a Ukrainian victory, then it&#8217;s the end for Putin.</p>



<p>British prime minister Boris Johnson has already pledged another £300million in military aid to Ukraine, while President <a href="https://the-sun.com/who/joe-biden">Biden</a> has asked Congress for extra support to help the fight against Russia.</p>



<p>The US Air Force revealed that Washington DC has committed around $2.6billion in security assistance to Ukraine so far.</p>



<p>Kuzio said: “The impact of western sanctions, new weapons coming from the West, and high levels of casualty will go up even more.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on April 30 that Russia had lost more than 23,000 soldiers in the conflict so far.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union lost around 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan during the 1980s.</p>



<p>Kuzio forecasts that Russian losses could reach at least 50,000 by the end of the conflict.</p>



<p>He said: “That’s when the infighting and squabbling begin at the top.</p>



<p>“Western sanctions take between three and six months to have an impact so that’s why I think by the end of the year.”</p>



<p>Kuzio believes that infighting will also start if Putin continues to show a “sign of weakness”.</p>



<p>He said: “A dictator should never show a sign of weakness.</p>



<h2 id="health-battles">&#8216;HEALTH BATTLES&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;On the issue of Putin’s health, I think some of it is probably speculation and exaggeration, but there’s no smoke without fire.</p>



<p>“There’s definitely something going on. If you look at a photo of Putin in 2014 and a photo of him today, there are two different faces. There’s something going on with his health.”</p>



<p>Kuzio says that Putin is more “paranoid and conspiratorial”.</p>



<p>Former Vice Chief of Staff of the US Army General Jack Keane (Ret.) told Fox News: “He’s all about staying in power. That’s his motivation. He will do anything to stay in power.</p>



<p>“The alternative, he knows full well, by a successor who doesn&#8217;t agree with him, could mean the end of him &#8211; his demise.”</p>



<p>Photos of the strongman have emerged of him puffy-faced while body language experts have speculated that he may be suffering from a serious breakdown.</p>



<p>An investigation by Proekt media revealed the tyrant is “constantly” accompanied by a doctor specializing in&nbsp;thyroid cancer.</p>



<p>The report states that thyroid cancer specialist surgeon, Yevgeny Selivanov, has flown to be beside the Russian leader no less than 35 times in Sochi.</p>



<p>Putin met several people who has tested for Covid during the pandemic and he was forced to self-isolate in September 2021, after several people close to him were struck down.</p>



<p>Researchers in 2015 claimed they&nbsp;identified signs in&nbsp;Putin&#8217;s gait which could point to&nbsp;Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>



<p>The team noticed how Putin had a tendency to keep one arm pinned to his side.</p>

<p>It has also been claimed he had been&nbsp;treated for cancer.</p>



<p>Political analyst Valery Solovei claimed&nbsp;Putin underwent surgery&nbsp;in February 2020 and another Russian source went on to claim it was an abdominal cancer operation.</p>

<h2>Did her husband Michael Peterson kill her?</h2>
<p>Michael Peterson was sentenced to life without parole in 2003 &#8211; telling his daughters &#8220;I love you&#8230; it&#8217;ll be alright&#8221; as he was hauled off to a holding cell.</p>
<p>Kathleen had been found dead at the bottom of a black staircase in their Durham (North Carolina) mansion.</p>
<p>He claimed she had fallen after an evening drinking as he smoked a cigar outside &#8211; but the prosecution claimed he beat her to death for the insurance money.</p>
<p>In 2017, he entered an Alford plea for voluntary manslaughter and was released on time served.</p>

<p>Military personnel are said to have carried out a manoeuvre to change their position in order to avoid &#8220;a possible retaliatory strike,&#8221; the defence ministry added.</p>



<p>The combat units &#8211; consisting of more than 100 men &#8211; also practised &#8220;actions in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination&#8221;.</p>



<p>Russia placed nuclear forces on high alert shortly after Putin sent troops to Ukraine on February 24.</p>

<p>Observers say that in recent days, Russia&#8217;s state television has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18414176/west-prepare-war-russia-nato-putin-cruise-missiles-submarine/">attempted to make nuclear weapons use more palatable</a> to the public.</p>



<p>&#8220;For two weeks now, we have been hearing from our television screens that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408230/putin-nuclear-attack-launch/">nuclear silos should be opened</a>,&#8221; Russian newspaper editor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov said on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Putin could use his<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18326876/putins-arsenal-superweapons-laser-canon-poseidon/">&nbsp;six superweapons</a>&nbsp;including the deadly Sarmat missile, &nbsp;dubbed &#8220;Satan 2&#8221;, that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">launched</a>&nbsp;last week to attack NATO countries.</p>



<p>The missile can fly 11,000 miles, carry 15 warheads and has the potential to destroy an area the size of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/">France</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to lawmakers, the unhinged despot said: &#8220;If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia.</p>



<p>&#8220;They must know that our response to counterstrikes will be lightning fast. Fast.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won’t brag about them.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we will use them.&#8221;</p>



<p>And it comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belarus/">Belarus</a> began sudden large-scale drills yesterday to test their combat readiness, the country&#8217;s defence ministry said.</p>

<p>But they soon realised that in the image posted with the obituary, it stated with his birth date followed by his death date as May 6, 2022 &#8211; two days into the future.</p>



<p>His obituary said: “An outdated variant of Dayton, Ohio-born actor, writer, producer, singer, songwriter, designer, poet, philanthropist, clairvoyant, and digital creator Tré Melvin peacefully departed this life, for the thousandth time, on Friday, May 6, 2022. </p>



<p>“Upon his deathbed, he documented his final thoughts.”</p>



<p>After learning the YouTuber hadn’t died, fans were outraged and flooded his comments to share their thoughts on the announcement.</p>



<p>A commenter wrote on Instagram: “Honestly bad marketing. Don’t play with death. Nothing funny or cute about this ad,”</p>



<p>Another user added: “Not funny.. A future dated death?”</p>



<p>Twitter users expressed similar views:</p>



<p>One commented: “This is too much. I was in shock and then sadness before I realized this is a joke. At least I hope it is. Don’t do this to people.” </p>



<p>Another upset fan tweeted: “DONT PLAY WITH ME LIKE THIS I WAS FULL BLOWN CRYING!!!”</p>



<p>Melvin, however, told <a href="https://blavity.com/youtuber-tre-melvin-posted-his-obituary-on-social-media-to-promote-new-song?category1=blavity-u-life-style&amp;category2=news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blavity </a>exclusively that the obituary was posted ahead of his new single Die 1,000 Times. </p>



<p>He added that there’s a thought-provoking message behind the controversial marketing move.</p>



<p>He told Blavity: “I chose to explore the cycle of death in this particular chapter to venerate my late best friend, Katherya Pacheco, and each of my benevolent ancestors. </p>



<p>“Each individual’s relationship with death differs from the next. </p>



<p>&#8220;Many view it to be taboo; too frightening a subject to discuss. </p>



<p>&#8220;But one thing I’ve learned from the car collision that rendered Kathy and I unconscious in June of 2020, and her earthly passing the following day, is that death is everything but.”</p>



<h2 id="when-did-tre-melvin-start-youtube">When did Tre Melvin start YouTube?</h2>



<p>Melvin first joined YouTube on October 9, 2011.</p>



<p>Since then, he has accumulated over 7 million followers across all social platforms and more than 1 billion video views worldwide.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the YouTuber has 3.21m subscribers.</p>

<figure id="attachment_18467067" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4f267245-ee48-45a3-be75-f4cdbbe3b36e.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18467067" width="960" height="438" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The bonds were found in a secret compartment</figcaption><figcredit>WCVB Channel 5 Boston/Youtube</figcredit></figure>



<p>The Governor Winthrop secretary desk is known for its hidden compartments, which Phil looked through in search of a missing part.</p>



<p>Instead, he found a stack of $127,000 (£80k) in mature savings bonds from an obscure narrow slot.</p>



<p>&#8220;I banged the desk forward and when the knob came out the envelope dropped,&#8221; Phil said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first thing I saw was a $500 bond.</p>

<p>&#8220;We [then] found 50s, and then we found 100s, 200s, 500s, and then we found a stack of six $10,000 bonds.&#8221;</p>



<p>This incredible story took an even more amazing turn when Phil returned the desk and the money to the auction house in the hope of returning the bonds to the rightful owner.</p>



<p>And he did. Better yet, the owner was in desperate need of cash to fund his 94-year-old father&#8217;s care.</p>



<p>The money couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time for the man, who had put up his dad&#8217;s house for sale to cover the expenses.</p>

<p>&#8220;The family had been looking for them for years,&#8221;  said Kelley, from Kelley Auctions house.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was so happy. It could not have happened to a nicer guy,&#8221; Kelley said about the man who had hired the auction company.</p>



<p>&#8220;We love stories like this. It&#8217;s why we do what we do.&#8221;</p>



<p>And Phil was happy the bonds were returned to their rightful owner.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a great find,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was even better after hearing the story of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>WINONA Ryder has been in the limelight from a young age &#8211; after appearing in blockbuster movies like Beetlejuice and Heathers as a teenager.</p>



<p>But like many child stars, their fame comes at the cost of their private life &#8211; including their dating life. </p>

<p>Although Winona has been linked to a number of Hollywood heartthrobs, it seems she has settled down with Scott Mackinlay Hahn.</p>



<p>Scott, who is a sustainable fashion designer, has been quite vocal regarding his stance on climate change, feminism, and eradicating fast fashion. </p>



<p>While the two might live quite a private life, with absolutely no social media presence, they have ventured on to the red carpet together many times.</p>



<p>Born in October 1980, he is nine years younger than partner, Winona, who was born in 1971.</p>

<p>The New Jersey artist had just found fame with his successful debut album, musicforthemorningafter.</p>



<p>Their relationship happened right around the same time as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1610477/troubled-star-winona-ryder-makes-unlikely-comeback-in-stranger-things-after-drug-and-theft-scandals-that-shocked-hollywood/">Winona&#8217;s shoplifting scandal</a>. </p>



<h3 id="beck-2000">Beck (2000)</h3>



<p>Winona was rumoured to be dating indie musician Beck in 2000.</p>



<p>When asked about Winona in an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beck-tears-of-a-clown-178527/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stones</a> a few years late, Beck said: &#8220;If you’re seen standing next to somebody, you’re together with them. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been keeping to myself mostly. I met her when I was younger, right before my first record came out. </p>



<p>&#8220;I hung out with her for a month or two. But talking about any of this is weird unless you’re a complete exhibitionist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Winona and Matt Damon were introduced by friends and fellow celebrity couple (at the time) Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>In 2009, Winona told <a href="https://blackbookmag.com/arts-culture/film/winona-ryder-bites-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blackbook Magazine</a>: “Matt couldn’t be a greater, nicer guy. I’m really lucky that I’m on good terms with him.”</p>

<p>In 1996, Winona was linked to X Files star David Duchovny, but it seems it was a little one sided. </p>



<p>During the time they were rumoured together, Duchovny told TV Guide: “I’m happy, and I’m in love.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Winona told an interviewer that she was “completely single” when asked about Duchovny’s comments. </p>



<p>Either they were never dating or Winona was completely uninterested.</p>

<p>The two struck up a romance after starring together in Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands.</p>



<p>In an interview, Winona admitted their relationship was full of firsts.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;When I met Johnny, I was pure virgin. He changed that. </p>



<p>&#8220;He was my first everything. My first real kiss. My first real boyfriend. My first fiancé. </p>

<p>Following their undeniable chemistry in Heathers, Winona was reportedly dating her co-star, Christian Slater, between 1988 and 1989.</p>



<p>But it sadly wasn&#8217;t meant to be with Winona and the teen heartthrob, as she told Vogue in 1993: “He broke my heart, or I thought he did at the time.”</p>

<p>BRIT holidaymakers have been warned of a serial killer on the loose in Spain as cops hunt for the murderer linked to the deaths of at least four men on dating apps.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/">Spanish</a> detectives are also looking into the mysterious deaths of another four men in Bilbao.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/">horror revelations</a> yesterday were sparked by a complaint in December from a man who claims he narrowly escaped an encounter with the killer.</p>



<p>He said the man tried to strangle him and later found his abandoned rucksack, which contained the party drug liquid ecstasy and personal documents after fleeing following a struggle.</p>



<p>Basque newspaper El Correo said all the deaths were attributed to natural causes during initial post-mortems.</p>



<p>But detectives now believe the men had been murdered after discovering money had been taken from their bank accounts and at least one had traces of liquid ecstasy in his body.</p>

<p>The theory investigators are now probing is that the suspected serial killer drugged his victims using the likes of liquid ecstasy, also known as GHB, and accessed their bank accounts after arranging to meet up on dates at their homes using <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/13863932/dating-app-grindr-fined-selling-information/">Grindr</a>.</p>



<p>The sick crimes echoes those of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/indonesia/">Indonesian</a> student <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16324117/who-is-reynhard-sinaga-and-where-is-he-now/">Reynard Sinaga</a>, 39, who was jailed for life in Manchester in January 2020 for raping <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16299491/reynhard-sinaga-manchester-rapist-catching-predator/">136 young men between 2015 and 2017</a>.</p>



<p>The sex predator, described as the most prolific rapist in British legal history, used liquid ecstasy to knock out his victims before attacking them.</p>



<p>Serial killer <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/stephen-port/">Stephen Port</a>, responsible for the deaths of four men in London, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17226525/four-lives-stephen-port-letters-prison/">also used GHB to murder victims</a> he met on Grindr.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17124170/who-were-stephen-ports-victims/">Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth, and Jack Taylor</a>, who were all in their early 20s, were killed by overdoses of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2247001/ghb-drug-effects/">GHB</a> administered by Port between June 2014 and September 2015.</p>



<p>He dumped their bodies near his flat in Barking, East London.</p>



<p>There has not yet been any official comment from Spanish police, who are said to be waiting the results of lab tests on tissue samples taken from at least four men identified as the most likely victims.</p>



<p>Bilbao’s mayor Juan Mari Aburto has admitted an investigation is ongoing but pleaded for calm.</p>



<p>El Correo has identified the suspect as a man aged between 20 and 30 with one local report saying he could be a Colombian called Carlos although he is believed to used a synonym online.</p>



<p>Detectives in the Basque Country are reportedly working in close co-operation with central police forces to see if they are investigating similar crimes elsewhere in Spain.</p>

<p>CHILLING footage shows Chinese officials bolting residents into their homes during a draconian Covid clampdown.</p>



<p>Videos posted on Chinese social media show residents who refuse to hand over their house keys also have wires drilled into their doors to stop them leaving.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18465783" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 818px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/lock3.png?strip=all&amp;w=808" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18465783" width="808" height="904" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflare</figcredit></figure>Residents that refuse to hand over their house keys have wires drilled into their doors to stop them leaving[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18465784" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 822px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/lock2.png?strip=all&amp;w=812" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18465784" width="812" height="926" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflare</figcredit></figure>One worker was filmed drilling bolts into the floor to stop the door from opening &#8211; locking residents inside[/caption]



<p>The over-the-top <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18218379/starving-shoppers-loot-shanghai-supermarket/">measures</a> were imposed in the northern Hebei province, according to the independent Chinese publication Caixin Global.</p>



<p>But the videos sparked outrage online, with social media users fearing the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17254643/china-lockdown-cancer-patients-pregnant-denied-care/">measures could be deadl</a>y, with residents stuck inside during an emergency.</p>



<p>One user wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo: “I’m so angry. They really <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17200380/china-strictest-lockdown-world-not-working/">don&#8217;t treat people like humans</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Faced with the backlash, authorities in Qianan county blamed individual residential communities for their “simplistic and radical means” of keeping Covid in check.</p>

<p>Taking to the Chinese app WeChat, Qianan Pandemic Prevention and Control Office said: “We are investigating and will modify the policy.</p>



<p>“We are also looking into the possibility of installing alarms to replace current methods.”</p>



<p>In the same county, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18215346/moment-pet-corgi-beaten-to-death-by-owner/">authorities</a> banned farmers from doing fieldwork in order to stop the spread of the bug.</p>



<p>Despite their best efforts, videos later emerged showing people sneaking out in the middle of the night to plough their fields.</p>

<p>Millions of others remain under <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18225547/starving-shanghai-residents-break-through-cordon/">various forms of lockdown</a> across China, where the rapid spread of the Omicron variant is wreaking havoc on the country’s hardcore zero-Covid policy.</p>



<p>On Tuesday the regime ramped up restrictions even further by banning certain residents from leaving the city.</p>



<p>Neighbourhoods were labelled “medium” and “high risk” for transmission.</p>



<p>Residents were then told they would be held &#8220;legally responsible” if they dared leave Beijing.</p>



<p>The city has also shut down dozens of subway stations to tackle Covid.</p>



<h2 id="covid-epicentre">COVID EPICENTRE</h2>



<p>Shanghai &#8211; which has a population of 26.3 million &#8211; remains China’s Covid epicenter.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, 4,982 new transmitted infections were reported in the Covid-ridden megacity, out of a total of 5,428 new transmissions nationwide.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in the central city of Zhengzhou &#8211; which has a population of 10 million &#8211; the government announced citywide Covid testing and a partial lockdown after only several cases were reported.</p>



<p>Enslaved residents from the main areas of the city have now been subjected to a partial lockdown from May 4 until May 10, the regime said.</p>



<p>This prompted a rush to the shops as residents panic bought essentials to last the seven-day lockdown.</p>



<p>Videos circulating online showed jammed roads and crowded supermarkets.</p>

<p>KIM Jong-un’s fashion police are pouncing on youngsters in hipster-style tight trousers.</p>

<p>The Socialist Patriotic Youth League, which acts as his police, has been filming women in their 20s and 30s who flout the law in tight pants or <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sun-selects/8400177/best-womens-black-skinny-jeans/">skinny jeans</a>.</p>



<p>They are dragged before branches of the league and told to write letters of self-criticism, pledging not to repeat the fashion crimes.</p>



<p>They are then released, although footage of their dress can be used in lectures to dissuade others.</p>



<p>In one video, the women were even described as having “indecent clothes” and “impure ideology”.</p>

<p>THE Sun has gained exclusive access to a prisoner of war camp in Ukraine and heard Russian soldiers’ incredible stories first-hand.</p>



<p>Captured troops claimed they were thrown into battle by “jackals” without proper training when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">President Vladimir Putin</a> launched his illegal invasion in February.</p>

<p>We interviewed two prisoners in Dnipro, selected by prison staff, and visited the cells where they sleep eight men to a room.</p>



<p>Both men had been visited by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross to check that they are being treated in accordance with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17806713/what-is-a-war-crime/">the Geneva Conventions</a>.</p>



<p>Our supervised interviews were limited to 90 minutes. The men we met showed no signs of injuries and said camp conditions were good.</p>



<p>The Sun has changed their names and kept their unit details secret to protect them from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/">Kremlin</a> reprisals.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="private-vadim-26-captured-in-kharkiv">PRIVATE VADIM, 26, CAPTURED IN KHARKIV</h2>



<p>VADIM was in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17750641/ukraine-frontline-rockets-basements/">Grad rocket launcher</a> when his convoy was hit by an ambush in Kharkiv on the third day of the war.</p>



<p>He said: “I was thrown out by an explosion and I saw a truck in front of me exploding. I thought everyone was dead. There was no way they could survive.</p>



<p>“The lorry behind me was hit and on fire. It was carrying ammunition and I knew it would start exploding so I had to get away.”</p>



<p>He crawled to a tree on the side of the road and passed out.</p>

<p>When he came round <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> shells were landing all around him.</p>



<p>He managed to bandage a wound on the top of his left thigh where it had been sliced open by shrapnel.</p>



<p>Vadim later staggered into an abandoned gatehouse, where he stayed for ten days, eating biscuits and sweets left by the guards that used to patrol it and drinking from a tap that still had running water.</p>



<p>When his leg was strong enough he tried to flee and staggered three miles through a wood on the edge of the city until he reached a bombed-out apartment block.</p>



<p>One of the flats had a fridge full of food so he stayed. But after three days he saw a Ukrainian patrol and decided to hand himself in.</p>



<p>He said: “I went downstairs and I walked very slowly with my hands up. I was thinking, ‘If there is a sniper then it’s over’.</p>



<p>“I heard a shout to stop and I knelt down on the floor, very slowly. They ordered me to lie down and asked me questions about who I was and where I had come from.</p>



<p>“Then they called another unit and I was taken away. First to one place, then to here.”</p>



<p>Vadim joined the army six years ago for the money. He earned around £650 a month.</p>



<p>He was training as a mechanic and planned to get his HGV licence so he could become a long-distance lorry driver after leaving the forces.</p>



<p>Vadim said: “Now I’ve got two options. Either I am in jail here or I will be in jail in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> because of what I have said about the Russian army.</p>



<p>“A lot of people think it is the second army in the world, but we have nothing. We have no training, we have no equipment and it is a crime to say that in Russia.”</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->

	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>He said one of the commanders he served with in the war was the best he had ever had. But the rest he cursed as “jackals”. Vadim said: “They don’t care about their men. They treat us like dogs.”</p>



<p>By the time Vadim’s rocket battery was ambushed on February 26 it had already fired almost 1,000 rockets in three devastating attacks.</p>



<p>He said he and his comrades knew something big was happening because a few days before the invasion they were ordered to hand in their phones and ID documents.</p>



<p>Vadim said: “At first we didn’t realise where we were or where we were going, but on the second day we knew. We crossed into Ukrainian territory and we knew, because we saw the border fence destroyed.</p>



<p>“We were ordered to fan out the vehicles and given co-ordinates to fire. We didn’t know what we were firing at, but now I have been told that we were hitting a village with civilians.”</p>



<p>His captors have also told him about the atrocities committed by Russian soldiers, including hundreds of accounts of murders, torture and child rape.</p>



<p>Vadim said: “I have thought about <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18420099/war-crimes-ukraine-britain/">war crimes</a> a lot. I believe it. Because I know how things go in my country. And because they let anyone join the army.”</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="corporal-ivan-22-captured-in-kharkiv">CORPORAL IVAN, 22, CAPTURED IN KHARKIV</h2>



<p>WHEN Corporal Ivan called his mum to tell her he had been captured, he said she could not speak because “she was crying so much”.</p>



<p>Tears streamed down his face as he described the moment PoW camp guards asked him to call home.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17776428/russia-ukraine-news-kyiv-attack-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-2/">Ukraine has let PoWs call home</a> to get the message through about what is happening in the war.</p>



<p>Ivan insisted the guards gave him no special message to deliver.</p>



<p>All they wanted was for her to know that her son had been captured and was still alive.</p>



<p>Ivan was part of a rocket artillery battery ambushed on the edge of Kharkiv. His truck-mounted Grad rocket launcher took a direct hit and exploded — but he managed to escape with two comrades.</p>



<p>They hid in a house until nightfall then fled on foot through a forest until they saw another Grad rocket launcher, which they thought was a Russian unit.</p>



<p>Ivan walked up to the rocket team, with both hands in the air.</p>



<p>But by the time he realised it was actually a Ukrainian unit all he could do was surrender.</p>



<p>He said: “They ordered me to lie down, they stripped all my clothes and searched me. Then the next day I was taken away.</p>



<p>“My biggest fear was I was going to die. When I was surrendering I was afraid I would be shot.”</p>



<p>Hours before the ambush he had been struck dumb by fear when gunmen opened fire on his convoy.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>Ivan said: “We jumped out and lay in holes. I thought I was going to die. I wasn’t thinking about anything, I just thought I would die. I felt sick and I couldn’t move.”</p>



<p>Astonishingly, he claimed his unit had never been trained on how to react in an ambush.</p>



<p>He said: “We only do field exercises twice a year.</p>



<p>“We go away for a month, twice a year, and practise firing, but we don’t train for ambushes.</p>



<p>“Artillery isn’t supposed to be ambushed.”</p>



<p>Up to that point his two-year army career had been mostly spent driving a snow plough to clear the roads around Murmansk.</p>



<p>His ambitions stretched only as far as moving in with his girlfriend and saving his £730-a-month salary to buy a car. Ivan said: “I wanted to get my driving licence and buy a Toyota Camry. I never thought I would go to war. Most of the time we are just clearing the snow or servicing the Grad machines.”</p>



<p>At first he signed on for two years. But when the time came round to leave, his girlfriend was in medical school.</p>



<p>So Ivan agreed to stay in the army for another three years and then move in together.</p>



<p>A few months after he extended his service, Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>



<p>Asked about <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18165739/russia-ukraine-war-maximum-sanctions-liz-truss/">Russian atrocities</a>, including torture, rape and murder, Ivan said: “I am shocked. They are just idiots.”</p>

<p>MAD VLAD&#8217;s so-called &#8220;victory over Ukraine parade&#8221; is set to be a sorry sight after the Russian tyrant is forced to scale it down by a THIRD, figures show.</p>



<p>The Russian president &#8211; who is rumoured to be &#8220;Cancer stricken&#8221; &#8211; will face public humiliation as he rolls out his massively depleted military stock on May 9 following <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18440740/moment-ukrainian-bayraktar-drone-sinks-two-russian-gunboats/">horrendous losses</a> in Ukraine.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18463321" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/90a76d0c-50a9-4f14-9844-416833bef2fb.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18463321" width="960" height="739" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Vladimir Putin is set for a humiliating day on May 9 with a drastically cut back parade</figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>

<figure id="attachment_18463336" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 739px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/RR-GRAPHIC-military-vehicles.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=729" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18463336" width="729" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin&#8217;s parade will be a sorry sight compared to what it was in 2021</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The parade &#8211; held every year to commemorate the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II &#8211; has been used by Russian leaders to flaunt their strength and demonstrate Russia’s military prowess.</p>



<p>But this year the show is 35-percent smaller, forcing Mad Vlad to dust down creaky equipment from the 1960s in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18311365/battle-for-donbas-ukraine-russia-war/">desperate effort to save face</a> on Moscow&#8217;s Red Square.</p>



<p>This will come as a massive blow to the tyrant who is understood to have set the May 9 date to declare <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">some form of victory</a> over Ukraine &#8211; whatever that may be.</p>



<p>But the invasion has been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18260351/russian-cruiser-moskva-sink-ukraine-snake-island/">far from successful</a> after facing massive resistance from hero Ukrainian fighters &#8211; forcing <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18450449/bodies-russian-soldiers-z-ukraine-kharkiv/">Putin&#8217;s butchers</a> to retreat and focus their operations in the eastern Donbas region. </p>

<p>The parade is therefore set to be a major humiliation, as it is revealed that the number of Russian Infantry Fighting Vehicles participating in the parade has been slashed by a whopping 50-percent.</p>



<p>Parade guides also show&nbsp;that only 25 Russian ground combat systems will be represented by 131 ground combat vehicles, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2022/05/02/russian-victory-day-parade-cut-by-35-emphasizing-ukraines-battlefield-prowess/?sh=43b8e5283485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> reported.</p>



<p>This is marked difference from the 198 combat vehicles from 35 separate systems rolled out in the 2021 parade.</p>



<p>After<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18275075/video-ukrainian-vehicle-destroys-russian-tank-donetsk/"> losing at least 114 T-80 main battle tanks</a> of various colours, Russia’s military is now apparently unable to find just ten display-ready T-80&#8217;s for this year&#8217;s parade.</p>

<p>This follows confirmed losses of at least&nbsp;600 tanks since Russia invaded Ukraine. </p>



<p>And the figures get worse, as only three BMP-3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles will be on parade &#8211; down from six last year.</p>



<p>And while Putin boasted 23 helicopters at the 2021 parade, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18144176/russia-target-british-weapons-accuses-escalating-war-ukraine/">he can only muster 15</a> for May 9.</p>



<p>The humiliation deepens as it is revealed that 10 Sukhoi Su-30 and Su-34 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18370496/russian-jet-shot-down-ukraine-war-video/">jets showed off in 2021 won&#8217;t even make an appearance</a>.</p>



<p>Artillery and multiple rocket launch systems have mostly disappeared from this year&#8217;s parade.</p>



<p>Instead they are represented by a single class of 152 mm self-propelled howitzer and an “updated” version of the old 122mm Grad multiple rocket launcher.</p>



<p>This is a battlefield system that was cutting edge back in the 1960’s.</p>



<p>The blatantly obvious holes in the parade will be an unwelcome reminder for Putin of Russia’s military shortcomings.</p>



<h2 id="cancer">&#8216;CANCER&#8217;</h2>



<p>The parade will be an opportunity for the world to take a good look at the tyrant after rumours allege he is gravely ill.</p>



<p>Putin has appeared puffy and fat in recent appearances, fanning the flames of speculation he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17793192/vladimir-putin-cancer/">may have Cancer</a>.</p>



<p>These rumours then rocketed after the popular Russian Telegram channel General SVR claimed claimed Mad Vlad is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18422816/putin-undergo-cancer-operation/">due to have treatment</a> for the life-threatening disease. </p>



<p>The channel even claims surgery might incapacitate him for “a short time” and that during this period the tyrant may be forced to briefly hand over power to an aide.</p>



<p>There has been no official confirmation regarding Putin’s alleged ill health and the Kremlin has not commented on the reports, either to confirm or deny them.</p>



<p>But a recent video showing the 69-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/">shaking uncontrollably</a> has fuelled speculation he&#8217;s not well at all.</p>



<p>Another clip also appeared to show the Russian leader gripping a table and tapping his foot &#8211; signs body language experts believe indicate he could be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s, dementia or cancer.</p>

<p>THIS is the horror moment huge explosions ripped through the Mariupol steel plant as Russian forces blasted the <strong>bomb-blitzed site</strong> with thermobaric missiles.</p>



<p>As brave <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainians</a> stage a desperate final stand against Putin&#8217;s troops in the besieged city, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18452619/russia-storm-azovstal-steel-plant/">Russian fighters have stormed the sprawling Azovstal complex</a> where hundreds of terrified civilians remain trapped in “hell” in bunkers.</p>

<p>In the clip released by the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic, fireball explosions can be seen rippling through the site as plumes of thick black smoke fill the air.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> forces continuing to storm the plant, communications have been lost with the brave Ukrainian defenders holding at the site.</p>

<p>At least 30 children are still trapped in the plant along with hundreds of civilians and thousands of diehard defenders from Ukraine’s marines and Azov Battalion.</p>



<p>The city’s mayor Vadym Boichenko said Russia pounded the plant with airstrikes, naval guns and ground-based heavy artillery.</p>



<p>Boichenko said: “People are still dying. Today there is no connection to understand what is happening, whether they are safe or not. Yesterday there was a connection with them. Today, no more.&#8221;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18452619/russia-storm-azovstal-steel-plant/#"></a></p>



<p>The steel plant is the final piece of Mariupol still under Ukrainian control as defenders frantically try to stop the strategic port city falling to Putin&#8217;s butchers.</p>

<p>But Russia denied reports it was trying to storm the fortress, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the devastating blitz as an attempt to stop the defenders from moving to firing positions.</p>



<p>He insisted President Putin had ordered troops not to attack on foot.</p>



<p>&#8220;There has been a public order by the supreme commander to cancel the storming; there is no storming,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We see that there are aggravations associated with the fact that the militants go to firing positions. These attempts are suppressed very quickly.”</p>



<p>As many as 400 civilians remain trapped in bunkers and tunnels below the site amid calls for a ceasefire &#8211; which saw 101 people rescued &#8211; to be extended.</p>



<p>Most of the 50 rescue buses departed empty leaving those remaining in the only corner of the besieged port city free of&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;occupation wondering if they would ever make it out alive.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>&nbsp;announced that only 101 civilians managed to escape before the shelling resumed.</p>



<p>Most arrived yesterday at a refugee centre in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17840490/where-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant/">Zaporizhzhia</a>.</p>



<h2 id="get-out-of-hell">&#8216;GET OUT OF HELL&#8217;</h2>



<p>Many had taken refuge in the plant when the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war began</a>&nbsp;in February.</p>



<p>None appeared hungry, leading to hopes that enough food remains for the civilians and 2,000 troops — including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18259207/ukraine-mariupol-russia-assault/">Azov Battalion</a>&nbsp;and marines who have vowed to fight to the end.</p>



<p>Red Cross chief Pascal Hundt confirmed last night that “hostilities have resumed”.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is intense fighting in and around Azovstal. We really have concern,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>He said of the evacuation: “We would have hoped that much more people would be able to join the convoy to get out of hell. It was just a terrible situation.</p>



<p>“Nonetheless, we managed to facilitate safe passage for a few. Their testimonies are heart-breaking.”</p>



<p>Sviatoslav Palamar, a commander at the site &#8211; dubbed The Alamo for the soldiers’ last stand &#8211;  said: “A powerful assault is under way with support from armoured vehicles and tanks.”</p>



<p>He said Russia was trying “to land a large number of infantry by boat”.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will do everything we can to repel this assault, but we call for immediate measures to evacuate civilians,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The UN-backed evacuation from the plant, where fighting began soon after the February 24 invasion, was due to last 24 hours but continued for five days before the ceasefire broke down.</p>



<p>It was unclear how many Ukrainian fighters were still inside, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000 in recent weeks, and 500 were reported to be wounded. </p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MR-UKRAINE-TUNNELS.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=950" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18332985" width="950" height="960" />



<p>It comes as the Russian military said it used sea-and air-launched missiles to destroy electric power facilities at five railway stations across Ukraine, while artillery and aircraft also struck troop strongholds and fuel and ammunition depots.</p>



<p>The flurry of attacks comes as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on May 9, marking the Soviet Union&#8217;s defeat of Nazi Germany. </p>



<p>The world is watching for whether Putin will use the occasion to declare a victory or expand what he calls a special military operation.</p>



<p>A declaration of all-out war would allow Putin to introduce martial law and mobilize reservists to make up for significant troop losses.</p>



<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the speculation as nonsense.</p>



<p>As areas across Ukraine came under renewed attack, Belarus, which Russia used as a staging ground for its invasion, announced military exercises starting Wednesday. </p>



<p>A top Ukrainian official said the country will be ready to act if Belarus joins the fighting.</p>



<p>The attacks on rail infrastructure were meant to disrupt the delivery of Western weapons, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said.</p>

<p>A SHOCKING photo taken moments after a family from hell exited a KFC has left people outraged.</p>



<p>The image shows piles of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/kfc/">KFC</a> containers and half-eaten meals scattered across three tables in a food court in Riyadh, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18461181" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/91fc1d39-4ebb-4944-8e33-203d45723f9b.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18461181" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Internet users raged over the mess a family from hell left at a KFC in Saudi Arabia</figcaption><figcredit>Reddit</figcredit></figure>



<p>The table was so filthy that the surface was hardly visible under plastic and paper containers, soft drink bottles and bits of food.</p>



<p>Piles of trash also fell on the floor with a puddle of soft drink left basically untouched.</p>



<p>The infuriating image was shared by Xshpeare on a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/reddit/">Reddit</a> forum and has received thousands of views since Monday.</p>



<p>According to Xshpeare, the dump was left before by a family of about eight to 10 people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was shocked when I saw how dirty they left it, it was so dirty that three workers had to clean it instead of the usual one,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/internet-enraged-mess-literally-trashy-family-left-food-court-table-viral-reddit-1703118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I even took a picture because I&#8217;ve never seen a mess that bad in a food court.&#8221;</p>



<p>Littering is illegal in Saudi Arabia and punishable with fines of 500 Saudi Riyals (£105) for a first violation and double that for repeat offenders.</p>



<p>But given this happened in a food court, the filthy offenders are likely to walk away without a problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Literally trashy,&#8221; one irate user wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel bad for the poor workers who have to deal with entitled people like this every day,&#8221; said another. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard to throw your garbage away.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another pointed to a bin nearby.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a godd**n bin less than 10 feet away. The laziness of some people astounds me,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>Another scathing comment read: &#8220;At least they left a bun on the floor to help soak up the soda that they dumped.&#8221;</p>



<p>In June, a video showed a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15222616/shocking-brawl-kfc-customers-punches/">Wild West-like 10-man brawl erupting in a KFC</a> restaurant in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/birmingham/">Birmingham</a>.</p>



<p>Staff and customers brandishing chairs came to blows at the fast-food restaurant in South Yardley.</p>



<p>Footage, taken by a stunned onlooker waiting for her dinner, shows several men throwing each other around while shouting and swearing.</p>



<p>Another man stands by the door holding a chair before a woman grabs it and pulls him by the collar.</p>



<p>Several men and the woman then shove one another while a staff member pleads with them to stop.</p>



<p>A 30-year-old beautician told The Sun Online: &#8220;I have no idea what caused the heat or the anger, but the one girl accused one of the staff members of laughing at her.</p>

<p>According to her birth certificate, the elderly woman was born in the village of Bela Vista, in Bom Jesus da Lapa, on 16th June 1900. She lives there to this day.</p>



<p>The bed-bound pensioner lives with her granddaughter Celia Cristina, as all her own children have already passed away.</p>



<p>Celia told local media: &#8220;I put food in her mouth, we have to do everything, change her underwear. My life is summed up by my taking care of her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Celia said her grandma was spritely before she became bed-bound just over eight years ago.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;She raised her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She took care of everything. She was really active until recently, she cooked, washed clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Guinness World Records says the world&#8217;s oldest living person is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379342/blind-nun-118-becomes-oldest-person-alive/">Frenchwoman Lucile Randon</a>, who was born on 11th February 1904 and is 118 years old.</p>



<p>The title passed on to her following the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18365106/worlds-oldest-person-kane-tanaka-dies-aged-119/">death of 119-year-old Kane Tanaka</a> of Japan on April 19.</p>



<p>Celia said of her grandmother: &#8220;We know she&#8217;s advanced in age, but to find out she&#8217;s the oldest person in the world? We&#8217;re amazed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maria has 13 great-grandchildren, six great-great-grandchildren, and her family hopes she will live to see her first great-great-great-grandchild.</p>



<p>Her great-granddaughter Vitoria Stefani said: &#8220;She is still aware of many things, she talks to us, but now she fails to remember things more and more often.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her other great-granddaughter Ivanilde Gomes, who moved in with her when she was just six, said: &#8220;I never lacked anything, and she always said the same phrase, which I always keep with me: &#8216;Go study, girl.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;If today I manage to graduate, it is thanks to the encouragement I got from my great-grandma.&#8221;</p>

<p>A MAN discovered tens of thousands of pounds worth of treasure and guns after stumbling upon the goldmine in his late grandparents&#8217; house.</p>



<p>Posting under the username EvilEnglish on Reddit, the man from Tennessee said that he was cleaning the farmhouse in preparation to sell it.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18459133" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 561px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730591621.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=551" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18459133" width="551" height="376" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>REDDITT/EvilEnglish</figcredit></figure>A Reddit user unearthed treasures when clearing out his grandparents&#8217; farmhouse[/caption]

<p>His grandparents lived in the property for 20 years, and when his grandfather died in 1998, his grandmother left the farmhouse and never returned before she passed away.</p>



<p>The long-standing house was inherited by the Redditor&#8217;s father before falling into his hands and he was tasked with cleaning it up before its sale.</p>



<p>In his now deleted post, the Reddit user said that the inherited house was in really bad condition after two decades of neglect.</p>



<p>But after dusting off the cobwebs, he stumbled across a closet under the staircase which had an old rug in it. To his surprise, underneath the dusty carpet was something special.</p>

<p>He wrote: “I pushed the carpet back further and saw a round cap with a circle indentation on it. I pulled off the cap and … A Secret Safe!”</p>



<p>He spent a few days trying open up the safe to figure out what exactly was so carefully hidden.</p>



<p>With his efforts to open the safe in vain, he called Major Safe Co., and hired a locksmith, according to information on&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/6gX1G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imgur</a>.</p>



<p>The locksmith struggled at first with EvilEnglish saying: “He said about 30 mins into this that if he had known what he was getting into, he would have referred the job to someone else.”</p>

<p>But at long last the locksmith managed to crack it open and revealed the hoard of hidden treasures inside.</p>



<p>The safe was stuffed full of boxes that held antique items such as rare coins, silver bars and many other things his grandparents had stored away.</p>



<p>The treasure boxes had suffered some water damage due to a pipe leak but thankfully the valuables inside remained intact.</p>



<p>“I knew my grandmother collected coins, but I thought we had found all of them!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Although there is not an exact figure confirmed for the find, it is estimated to amount to around tens of thousands of pounds.</p>



<p>After posting his findings on Reddit, another user commented on his post and said that the prestige sets of coins were worth at least $20 each. </p>



<p>However, the silver coins would fetch far more in value on the market.</p>



<p>“At the moment their melt value is 17.3 times face value,” the user wrote. “With low silver prices and extremely high demand for physical silver, most respectable dealers will pay you melt right now.”</p>



<p>In addition, the silver bars that EvilEnglish found were also told to be worth around $24 each.</p>



<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough the lucky user found dollar bills worth a fair bit of cash.</p>



<p>But the final treasure he unearthed from the large safe was not just valuable financially.</p>



<p>EvilEnglish discovered another box filled with jewellery which brought him even closer to his late nan by fulfilling a childhood dream.</p>



<p>The Reddit user grew up having his grandparents read Treasure Island to him when he visited.</p>



<p>And it was a touching moment that brought back the memories of the times he had shared with them and his wishes of finding a box full of jewels.</p>



<p>“Funny that as a boy, in that very house, my Grandma read me Treasure Island,” EvilEnglish wrote. “And I always dreamed of finding something like this!”</p>



<p>He then found yet another safe when opening a coffee table which hid treasures from his grandfather.</p>

<p>AN unassuming house has hit the market for just £250,000 – but there’s a surprise tucked away in the basement.</p>



<p>The three-bedroom, two-bathroom <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/homes/">home</a> in Marietta, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a>, US, appears to be a typical family abode, with cosy furnishings and wooden accents.</p>

<p>But lurking downstairs is something far from normal.</p>



<p>An innocent wooden door leads to an ominous stone hallway, with stairs leading down into a cave hidden underneath the house.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/">property</a>, which was built in 1900, is described on the listing as a “special house.&#8221;</p>



<p>It read: “Starting outside, you see the beautiful patio area that opens up or closes for privacy. There is a hidden area for the trashcans too to keep the beautiful aesthetic.</p>

<p>“Enter the home through the kitchen which has tons of cabinet space and countertops. Once you walk into the living room you are welcomed with lots of natural light and the openness of the space.</p>



<p>“The home has plenty of beautiful accent pieces like the large wooden beams, built-in closets, hidden compartments, small windows near the stairs, and grand light fixtures.</p>



<p>“The bedrooms upstairs are huge with plenty of closet space. There are over seven off-street parking spaces and a good-sized backyard for enjoyment.</p>

<p>Pictures of the quirky home were shared on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/facebook/">Facebook</a>, where users were stunned by the surprise cave.</p>



<p>One person said: “That would be an amazing torture chamber! I mean cold storage. Yeah, cold storage.”</p>



<p>“I mean, if they want to sell it they should advertise it as a time out room, guaranteed to make your children listen,” another user joked.</p>



<p>Someone else said: “On the one hand, it’s creepy as hell. On the other, it could make a good wine cellar.”</p>



<p>“I find this incredibly creepy. I wonder if the neighbors know that there is a cave under their house, linked to their neighbor. All kinds of horror movies come to mind,” commented another person. [sic]</p>



<p>Someone else added: “Not every day you see a home complete with a place to keep your pet dragon&#8230;”</p>



<p>The listing comes after a group of British students revealed their “confusing home” – which too <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/real-life/16440358/we-live-in-britains-most-confusing-house/">featured its own cave.</a></p>



<p>Taking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a>, the students showed of their home as they noted that the shower was is in a cave and also had a pothole in it.</p>



<p>According to the TikToker, he and his mates pay £130 a week each to live in the strange house.</p>



<p>The video has since been watched millions of times.</p>

<p>A WOMAN has been found buried in a neighbour&#8217;s garden as her mum revealed the haunting moment she could have saved her.</p>



<p>Thuane da Silva Machado, 20, had been sent out by her mum to buy vegetables but failed to return to her home in southern <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/">Brazil</a> on Monday.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18458514" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 721px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8dfe002d-18d6-4135-b744-61191f17da71.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=711" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18458514" width="711" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Thuane Silva went missing near her home in southern Brazil on Monday</figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>

<p>Her panicked mum Simone went out into the streets looking for her and asked neighbours for help.</p>



<p>But in a horrifying twist, Simone said she remembered hearing a girl scream but didn&#8217;t realise it her own daughter until it was too late.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;When I passed by with a neighbour, I heard someone shouting &#8216;mum, help!'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I went home. Half an hour later, the penny dropped.&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned to her neighbour&#8217;s home and asked him to let her in to search for her missing daughter.</p>



<p>He agreed and Simone didn&#8217;t find anything &#8211; but noted that a porno was playing on his TV.</p>



<p>The man later fled the scene on a motorbike.</p>



<p>Simone said: &#8220;The police arrived, they sealed it off. After night fell, I don&#8217;t know how, they found her buried outside his door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thuane&#8217;s body was reportedly found with signs of sexual assault and was later sent to the morgue in nearby Duque de Caxias.</p>



<p>Simone said the suspect is an ex-convict and a known wife-beater who had been living at the residence for less than a month.</p>



<p>Simone said of her daughter, who, like her, was a churchgoer: &#8220;My daughter was such a perfect girl, a young girl, a family girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;My daughter didn&#8217;t go out, she just stayed on her mobile phone, on social media, a calm girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>The police are searching for the suspect &#8211; whose identity has not been reported &#8211; and they continue to investigate the crime scene.</p>

<h2>What happened to Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span>?</h2>
<p>Schumacher suffered a horrific ski crash while with his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/14444163/f1-legend-michael-schumacher-son-mick-msc/">son Mick</a>, who was 14 at the time, on the slopes above Méribel in the French Alps on December 29, 2013.</p>
<p>He fell and hit his head on a rock while crossing an off-piste area &#8211; suffering a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet.</p>
<p>Doctors said he would most likely have died had he not been wearing the safety gear, and the world champ was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital.</p>
<p>Schumacher immediately underwent two surgeries.</p>

<p>He was put into a medically induced coma after suffering what was described as a &#8220;traumatic brain injury&#8221;.</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> driver was brought <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16298336/michael-schumacher-coma/">out of the coma</a> by June 2014 and was released to go and rehabilitate at his home in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/switzerland/">Switzerland</a>.</p>
<p>Since then information on his treatment and his condition has been patchy despite the intense interest from fans and the press.</p>
<p>His tragic ski accident came just over a year after he retired from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/f1/">F1</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>He had mounted a brief comeback for three seasons with the new Mercedes team after initially hanging up his helmet in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2021, his family broke their eight-year silence on the seven-time world champion&#8217;s condition in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16081540/michael-schumacher-wife-different-strong-netflix/">Netflix documentary examining his illustrious career.</a></p>
<h2>Where is Michael Schumacher now?</h2>
<p>Schumacher was skiing off piste in an area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit in France when he fell and hit his head on a rock.</p>
<p>Even though he was wearing a helmet he suffered a horrendous head injury.</p>
<p>He was airlifted to hospital and put into a medically induced coma.</p>
<p>Doctors performed two operations on him to remove blood from his brain and relieve the pressure.</p>
<p>After being in hospital for a year he was taken back to his home in Lake Geneva in 2014 where it&#8217;s believed he has remained ever since while undergoing further rehabilitation.</p>
<p>His wife Corinna explained in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/15734438/michael-schumacher-netflix-documentary-release-date/">Netflix interview</a>: &#8220;We&#8217;re together. We live together at home. We do therapy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he&#8217;s comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to make him feel our family, our bond, And no matter, I will do everything I can. We all will.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How is Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span> doing now?</h2>
<p>Information about Schumacher&#8217;s ongoing health and condition remains closely guarded by his family and manager, but Schumacher, released in September 2021, delved deeper than ever before into the life of the racing legend.</p>
<p>It features interviews with members of Michael&#8217;s close family, including his father Rolf and brother Ralf, as well as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/6248647/michael-schumacher-wife-corinna-f1-children-mick-gina-maria/">Corinna</a> and their two children, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6245047/michael-schumacher-daughter-gina-maria-condition/">Gina</a> and Mick.</p>
<p>It also includes conversations with racing royalty such as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12163766/michael-schumachers-ferrari-boss-jean-todt/#:~:text=Jean%20Todt%20was%20the%20seven,to%202004%2C%20under%20his%20leadership.">Jean Todt</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bernie-ecclestone/">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/sebastian-vettel/#:~:text=Sebastian%20Vettel%20is%20a%20German,the%20youngest%20champion%20in%202010.">Sebastian Vettel</a>, Mika Häkkinen, Damon Hill, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10328045/flavio-briatore-girlfriend-heidi-klum-naomi-campbell/">Flavio Briatore</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/3922470/david-coulthard-net-worth-f1-formula-one/">David Coulthard</a>.</p>
<p><strong>December 2013</strong>  &#8211; After his crash, Schumacher is rushed to Grenoble Hospital where he undergoes two surgeries and is placed into a coma.</p>
<p>Professor Jean-Francois Payen describes his condition as &#8220;extremely serious&#8221; and says the F1 champ underwent a brain scan.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in a critical condition and his condition is said to be extremely serious. He is in intensive care,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>April 2014</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s manager Sabine Kehm tells the press that the racer is showing &#8220;moments of consciousness&#8221; as he emerged from his coma.</p>
<p>She added he was making &#8220;progress&#8221; &#8211; but noted Schumacher was facing a &#8220;long difficult fight&#8221; on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Kehm also insisted the family did not intend to give a running commentary on his condition.</p>
<p><strong>June 2014 </strong>&#8211; Schumacher is reported to have regained consciousness fully and is transferred to the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>September 2014</strong> &#8211; Schumacher leaves the Swiss hospital and returns to his family home in Gland on the shores of Lake Geneva to continue his recovery.</p>
<p>His manager Kehm again insists that he has made &#8220;progress&#8221; but a &#8220;long and difficult road&#8221; remains ahead for the F1 star.</p>
<p><strong>November 2014</strong> &#8211; Former racing driver Philippe Streiff, a friend of Schumacher, claims the seven-time champion cannot speak, is paralysed, and is using a wheelchair.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is getting better but everything is relative. It’s very difficult,&#8221; the former F1 driver told French radio.</p>
<p><strong>May 2015</strong> &#8211; Kehm delivers a video message in the first official update on his condition for months as part of a launch event for a watch that Schumacher helped design.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are happy to say still he does improvement and I say this always considering the severeness of the injury he had,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;But of course it will take a very long time for everybody involved to fight, and we are happy to take this <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/16661846/michael-schumacher-fighting-eight-years-crash/">fight</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>February 2016</strong> &#8211; Cryptic comments by Schumacher&#8217;s former Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo spark further speculation about the driver&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have news and unfortunately it is not good,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Life is strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a fantastic driver and only had one accident with Ferrari in 1999.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schumacher&#8217;s team decline to comment on his remarks.</p>
<p><strong>September 2016</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s lawyer Felix Damm tells a German court that his client &#8220;cannot walk&#8221; as part of a lawsuit against magazine Die Bunte.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Michael cannot even stand with the help of his special therapists.</p>
<p>I cannot make any other comments about Michael&#8217;s health situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Die Bunte had claimed Schumacher was able to take steps and raise an arm months previously, which was rebutted by Kehm.</p>
<p><strong>August 2018</strong> &#8211; French magazine Paris March reported that &#8220;close relatives&#8221; told them the F1 champ remains in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>It was claimed that Schumacher cries when he is rolled to look at the panoramic landscapes around his home.</p>
<p>Previous reports had also claimed the racer cried when he heard his children&#8217;s voices, or saw his wife Corinna.</p>
<p><strong>July 2019</strong> &#8211; F1 boss <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16055830/michael-schumacher-health-update-french-alps-crash/">Jean Todt</a> offers one of the most detailed health updates in years which speaking to Radio Monte-Carlo.</p>
<p>He reveals he visits Schumacher and the duo have even watched F1 races together on television.</p>
<p>The former Ferrari boss insists that he is making &#8220;good progress&#8221; &#8211; but adds he has to be &#8220;careful&#8221; with his statements.</p>
<p><b>February</b><strong> 2019 &#8211; </strong>Schumacher is reported to have spent the winter at his family&#8217;s luxury <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8524111/michael-schumacher-luxury-majorca-villa-carers/">£26million Majorca villa</a> with round-the-clock carers.</p>
<p>Neighbours told Bunte they saw the German racing legend arrive by dark blue helicopter at Port d’Andratx on the Spanish island.</p>
<p>The family purchased the property in 2018 &#8211; and it reportedly has two swimming pools, a large manicured garden, helipad and stunning sea views.</p>
<p><strong>September 2019</strong> &#8211; Le Parisien reports Schumacher has been admitted to the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris to undergo <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16125964/michael-schumacher-pioneering-stem-cell-therapy/">stem cell treatment</a>.</p>
<p>It is claimed he was under the care of pioneering surgeon Philippe Menasché.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7447481/Pictured-Ambulance-took-Michael-Schumacher-Paris-hospital.html">Pictures emerge allegedly showing a private ambulance</a> that had brought Schumacher to the hospital, and medical staff were quoted as saying he was &#8220;conscious&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>June 2020</strong> &#8211; Schumacher&#8217;s son Mick releases an open letter about his father as he looked destined to follow him into F1 as he impressed while racing in F2.</p>
<p>While not giving any updates on his health, Mick wrote: &#8220;He is always my father in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I don&#8217;t take the lessons he passed on to me as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these lessons is to remain constant, never to be too euphoric or too depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>June 2020 </strong>&#8211; Schumacher is reported to have had further stem cell treatments delayed due to the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>It is also claimed the F1 driver was suffering muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, a bone wasting disease, from being confined to bed for six years.</p>
<p>Dr Nicola Acciari said: &#8220;The goal is to regenerate Michael’s nervous system.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>November 2020</strong> &#8211; F1 boss Todt again speaks out on Schumacher and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12644800/michael-schumacher-fighting-jean-todt-reveals-secret-visit-last-week/">says he visits him regularly</a>, during which the two watch TV together.</p>
<p>&#8220;His fight continues, along with his family and doctors,” Todt told De Telegraaf newspaper.</p>
<p>However, he declines to comment when asked if Schumacher is aware of his son&#8217;s success &#8211; with the younger racer winning the 2020 F2 title and earning a seat in F1 with Haas.</p>
<p><strong>April 2021</strong> &#8211; Michael&#8217;s wife Corrina <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14673054/michael-schumacher-wife-selling-lake-geneva-home/">reportedly puts their Lake Geneva home up for sale for £5million.</a></p>
<p>Bodyguards and domestic workers were staying at the home until recently with some horses having grazed the pastures only a few months ago.</p>
<p>The couple had bought the &#8220;Sur le Moulin&#8221; estate in 2002 when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-schumacher/">Michael</a> was about to win his fifth F1 world title in 2002 for £3million.</p>
<p><strong>August 2021 &#8211; </strong>F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone makes a promising comment that Michael could one day answer questions himself.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;He is not with us at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when he gets better, he’ll answer all the questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>September 2021 &#8211;</strong> Ahead of the release of Schumacher, it was revealed that Michael had raised concerns about the snow conditions in the Alps before his tragic accident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/7671033/michael-schumacher-wife-different-strong-netflix/">Breaking her solemn eight-year silence, his wife Corrina explained</a>: &#8220;Shortly before it happened in Meribel, he said to me, &#8216;The snow isn&#8217;t optimal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could fly to Dubai and go skydiving there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said as he had &#8220;always made it through his races safely&#8221; she was &#8220;certain he had a few guardian angels that were keeping an eye out for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/15960917/michael-schumacher-netflix-documentary-wife-f1/">53-year-old said</a> of his condition: &#8220;&#8216;Everybody misses Michael, but Michael is here &#8211; different, but here. He still shows me how strong he is every day.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>November, 2021</strong> &#8211; Motor racing executive and family friend Jean Todt offered an update on his friend in an interview with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-10173269/Jean-Todt-gives-insight-Michael-Schumacher-eight-years-Germans-horror-skiing-accident.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Daily Mail,</a> having visited him the month before.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I can understand why his family and friends are protecting him because we should leave him in peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael is fighting, he is fighting, and we can only hope that he will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy that his son Mick is in Formula One.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is doing well.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could have a more competitive car but I am pleased he has this passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy that Gina-Maria (Michael&#8217;s daughter) has found her passion in horses.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>January 2022 &#8211; </strong>Michael&#8217;s son Mick marked his dad&#8217;s 53rd birthday by paying tribute in an emotional social media post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy birthday, dad. Days like these were important to my growing passion for motorsport, and still affects it to this day,&#8221; he wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for all the experiences you have given me and I’m excited to be making new ones in the future.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What has Michael <span class="il">Schumacher</span>&#8216;s family said?</h2>
<p>Schumacher&#8217;s family &#8211; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10620686/michael-schumacher-wife-small-steps-anniversary-accident/">his wife Corinna</a> and their children <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/14232554/mick-schumacher-proud-dad-michael-f1-debut/">Mick</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6245047/michael-schumacher-daughter-gina-maria-condition/">Gina-Maria</a> &#8211; have fiercely defended their privacy amid the intense interest over his health.</p>
<p>The family all live together at home to care for him and &#8220;do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he&#8217;s comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corinna explained in the Schumacher documentary: &#8220;It&#8217;s very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us, now we are protecting Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>On August 9, 2018, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6980069/michael-schumacher-son-mick-wins-first-race/">Mick</a> shared memories of his dad after snapping up his first victory in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7487690/mick-schumacher-michael-schumacher-f3-f1-motorsport/">European Formula 3</a> at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium – his dad’s favourite track.</p>
<p>Speaking about his victory with Mobil 1 The Grid, the young racer said the track brought him many happy memories as it was often labelled “the living room of my dad”.</p>
<p>In the Netflix documentary, Corinna said she has never blamed God for her husband&#8217;s battle, saying it was &#8220;just really bad luck &#8211; all the bad luck anyone could ever have in their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mick has faced questions about his dad during his rise up the motorsport pyramid. He won the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/13398735/mick-schumacher-f2-world-championship-michael-f1/">F2 title in 2020</a> and debuted in F1 in 2021.</p>
<p>Speaking before his first race with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/14733165/mick-schumacher-f1-debut/">Haas in Bahrain</a>, Mick told ESPN: &#8220;I had the best teacher and I&#8217;m happy to have made it all the way now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>After following his father&#8217;s footsteps, in the new documentary, the 23-year-old touchingly told how he would &#8220;give up everything&#8221; to chat with his dad about their shared motorsport success.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: &#8220;Since the accident, of course, these experiences, these moments that I believe many people have with their parents, are no longer present or to a lesser extent.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;And in my view, that is a little unfair.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;I think me and dad, we would understand each other in a different way now.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;Simply because we speak a similar language – the language of motor sport – and that we would have a lot more to talk about.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;And that is where my head is most of the time. Thinking that would be so cool … I would give up everything just for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/mick-schumacher-interview-michael-haas-2022-b2033727.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Independent</a> in March 2022, Mick addressed the perceived burden of being Michael&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>He said: “I don’t feel that pressure because I don’t pay attention to it, I just blend it out.</p>
<p>“I can create my own legacy while still looking back at what my dad did.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s nice for me to be able to remind people of what my dad did and at the same time show what can I do.”</p>

<p>CAN you spot the deadly snake lurking among the leaves on this forest floor?</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/reddit/">Reddit</a> users have been trying to spot the almost invisible serpent.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18457199" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000319264575.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18457199" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can you spot the venomous snake lurking in the leaves?</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>It shows an innocuous forest floor covered in dried leaves, sticks and bits of green plants but among it hides a lethal serpent &#8211; can you see it?</p>



<p>&#8220;The reason why you need to watch every step you take when out in the woods,&#8221; the post&#8217;s author captioned the photo.</p>



<p>The image left users scratching their heads.</p>



<p>&#8220;Based on this, watching your step seems futile. Unless I want to spend my whole afternoon taking a very safe 50ft hike,&#8221; one person wrote.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gotta use your walking sticks like the blind use canes,&#8221; quipped a second.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is why I wear closed toed shoes,&#8221; said another.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have to sprint and scream as loud as you can while in the woods. This will scare pretty much everything away,&#8221; wrote a third.</p>



<p>Look a little closer and you&#8217;ll spot an S shape on the left of the yellow-green leaf in the middle. </p>

<p>The venomous Copperhead snake has light brown triangles and is completely camouflaged with the foliage.</p>



<p>It comes as a hiker snapped <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18397214/hiker-ghost-figure-rare-phenomenon/">a “ghost-like figure”</a> when he climbed a mountain last month.</p>



<p>Thomas Swallow, 39, had gone ahead of his friends when he turned and saw a figure hovering high above the ground.</p>



<p>But he was actually looking at his own reflection on Great End in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/18166916/grasmere-luxury-glamping-weekend-lake-district/">Lake District</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The phenomenon is a rare&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/optical-illusion/">optical illusion</a>&nbsp;known as a brocken spectre, where a large shadow is cast onto cloud or mist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thomas, of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/manchester/">Manchester</a>, said: &#8220;I was taken aback a little bit. It&#8217;s really beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like a figure floating into the sky, it looks quite spiritual.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was weird, surreal and a really beautiful moment &#8211; I was looking down a gully from the summit, the sun was behind me and shining bright.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a cloudy day so the clouds were moving in and out of the summit.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could see moisture particles in the air when I looked up and I saw my shadow in the middle of a rainbow.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in the moment and enjoying it thinking &#8216;I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this before&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her three nephews were left with serious injuries after the accident on the region&#8217;s Chiclayo-Picsi road.</p>



<p>Rosa was put into a coffin for her funeral last Tuesday &#8211; but she interrupted the service after shocked family members heard a noise coming from her casket.</p>



<p>Her relatives heard the banging after they had lifted the coffin onto their shoulders and immediately lowered it.</p>



<p>They opened the lid to find Rosa alive and peering at them.</p>

<p>But tragically she died a few hours later. </p>



<p>Her devastated relatives are now calling for healthcare chiefs to find out how she was declared dead &#8220;in the first place&#8221;.</p>



<p>Her aunt told local media: &#8220;We want to know why my niece reacted yesterday, when we were taking her to be buried.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have the videos in which she pushes and touches the coffin.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s understood Rosa&#8217;s relatives believe she fell into a coma after the crash which could explain why doctors thought she was dead.</p>



<p>Cops in Peru are said to be investigating the bizarre incident. </p>



<p>It comes after a pensioner who was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18438612/chinese-covid-victim-alive-body-bag/">pronounced dead turned out to be alive</a> just as his body was about to be taken to a crematorium.</p>



<p>Footage emerged on&nbsp;Chinese&nbsp;social media showing the moment baffled workers unzipped a body bag after staff noticed movement as it was put in a hearse.</p>



<p>The clip shows officials in protective gear hauling a yellow body bag from the hearse.</p>



<p>They can be heard telling staff to open it and one person says: &#8220;You come here and see if he&#8217;s dead? He is still breathing! Didn&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s moving?&#8221;</p>



<p>The unverified footage then shows the body bag being peeled back &#8211; revealing the pensioner is indeed still alive despite carers thinking he&#8217;d died from&nbsp;Covid.</p>



<p>A person then tells staff: &#8220;He is alive, don&#8217;t cover his face ever again.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.4bc.com.au/three-year-old-fights-for-life-after-being-found-on-a-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local report</a>, the girl had been on the bus since 9.30am.</p>



<p>Temperatures in Rockhampton reached 29C on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Cops are understood to be interviewing staff at the centre and are inspecting a white minivan.</p>

<p>Queensland Ambulance Service paramedic Jason Thompson was at the scene when the girl was found.</p>



<p>&#8220;I get goosebumps just as I speak about it now,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-04/girl-in-critical-condition-bus-gracemere-rockhampton/101038566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC</a> news.</p>



<p>&#8220;When a child is sick, it&#8217;s traumatic, and when one is as critical and unconscious, your heart goes out to them,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>MADELEINE McCann&#8217;s mum fought back tears as she read a poem at a vigil to mark the painful 15th anniversary of her daughter&#8217;s disappearance.</p>



<p>Brave <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3428293/who-madeleine-mccann-parents-gerry-kate-brothers-sisters/">Kate and Gerry</a>, pictured for the first time in public in four years, were warmly welcomed by their community during a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18439160/madeleine-mccanns-parents-need-answers/">poignant prayer service</a> in their home village of Rothley, Leicestershire.</p>

<p>It comes amid reports that investigators have claimed they have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18451677/madeleine-mccann-pyjama-fibres-christian-b-van/">found evidence in the camper van of prime suspect Christian B</a> — amid speculation it is tell-tale fibres from her pink Eeyore pyjamas.</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry, who hold onto a glimmer of hope that Maddie &#8211; who would now be aged nearly 19 &#8211; is still alive appeared overwhelmed by the support as they joined in prayers and readings to mark the occasion.</p>



<p>The annual outdoor event has been cancelled over the past two years because of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid</a> restrictions.</p>



<p>And in 2019 Kate turned up alone with her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8663944/madeleine-mccann-brother-sister/">twins Sean and Amelie</a> &#8211; now aged 17 &#8211; as her heart doctor husband was away in Italy at an important medical conference.</p>

<p>Former surgery GP turned hospital medical worker Kate, 54, had dashed from work to join Gerry at the war memorial for the welcomed event.</p>



<p>Kate, wearing black jeans, a blue V-neck sweater and trainers, fought back tears as children lit candles for Maddie and other lost youngsters.</p>



<p>Neither parent addressed the 100-strong crowd but Kate, wearing reading glasses, read a poem, saying: “Survival can be summed up three words.</p>



<p>“Never give up. That’s the heart of it really, just keep trying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes you have to get knocked down, Lower than you have ever been.</p>



<p>“To stand up taller than you ever were. Perseverance is stubbornness.”</p>



<p>The McCann’s joined family, pals and villagers for an informal evening service after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433235/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-charged-months/">German rapist Christian B</a> was recently made an official suspect over Maddie’s abduction and presumed murder.</p>



<p>A family source said: &#8220;Kate and Gerry enjoy going to the service for a time of prayer and quiet reflection. They always appreciate the support of the public.”</p>



<p>They met in the chilly night air at Cross Green on the milestone anniversary and where a candle for the world’s most famous missing child still burns around the clock.</p>



<p>Cardiologist Gerry, 53, casually dressed in navy trousers, salmon-pink T-shirt and grey-blue sweater, later individually thanked well-wishers for attending the half-hour gathering.</p>



<p>Vicar of the local parish church, the rev. Rob Gladstone, who led the prayers, opened the service by telling the crowd: &#8220;Once again after a gap of two years we’re able to come together again here at Cross Green to remember Madeleine, to show solidarity to Kate and Gerry, Sean and Amelie.</p>



<h2 id="painful-years">&#8216;PAINFUL YEARS&#8217;</h2>



<p>“Lord we thank you for sustaining Gerry and Kate through these painful years.</p>



<p>“Keep us their hope of finding Madeleine, of discovering the truth of her disappearance..real hope is hard won.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the gathering touching messages of support were read out by children.</p>



<p>Pictures of a young Maddie were tied to the railing around the war memorial and a vase of fresh yellow flowers was placed on the ground.</p>



<p>The Maddie candle burned brightly as Rev Gladstone said: “We hope the light here in Rothley dispels the darkness.”</p>



<p>At times Kate and Gerry appeared tearful, at other times they smiled.</p>



<p>Kate, who appeared to be limping, was hugged by friends and supporters.</p>



<p>Three-year-old Maddie vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May 2007.</p>



<p>She was discovered missing from her bed in the seaside complex by her horrified mum shortly after 10pm.</p>

<p>Most of 50 rescue buses departed empty leaving those remaining in the only corner of the besieged port city free of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> occupation wondering if they would ever make it out alive.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> announced that only 101 civilians managed to escape before the shelling resumed. </p>

<p>Many had taken refuge in the plant when the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war began</a> in February.</p>

<p>None appeared hungry, leading to hopes that enough food remains for the civilians and 2,000 troops — including the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18259207/ukraine-mariupol-russia-assault/">Azov Battalion</a> and marines who have vowed to fight to the end.</p>



<p>Sviatoslav Palamar, a commander at the site — dubbed The Alamo for the soldiers’ last stand — said: “A powerful assault is under way with support from armoured vehicles and tanks.” </p>



<p>He said Russia was trying “to land a large number of infantry by boat”. </p>



<p>He said: “We will do everything we can to repel this assault, but we call for immediate measures to evacuate civilians.”</p>

<p>The UN-backed evacuation from the plant, where fighting began soon after the February 24 invasion, was due to last 24 hours but continued for five days before the ceasefire broke down.</p>



<p>Of those to get out, 11 chose to stay in Russian-held territory. </p>



<p>The rest, including 12 sick and injured, headed for Zaporizhzhia. </p>



<p>They were joined by 58 others in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18424500/horror-conditions-civilians-kids-mariupol-bunker/">Mariupol’s outskirts</a>.</p>



<p>The group was screened by Russian soldiers at dozens of checkpoints and a four-hour journey in peacetime took 48. </p>



<p>Some chose not to go all the way to the refugee centre, where 127 arrived.</p>



<p>Red Cross chief Pascal Hundt confirmed last night that “hostilities have resumed”. </p>



<p>He added: “There is intense fighting in and around Azovstal. We really have concern.”</p>



<p>He said of the evacuation: “We would have hoped that much more people would be able to join the convoy to get out of hell. It was just a terrible situation.</p>



<p>“Nonetheless, we managed to facilitate safe passage for a few. Their testimonies are heart-breaking.” </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="traumatised-people">&#8216;TRAUMATISED PEOPLE&#8217;</h2>



<p>Mr Hundt said the worst wounds ­suffered by the refugee group were ­psychological. </p>



<p>He said: “Food and water was maybe not the biggest need for them. I think the biggest need they have was for safety.</p>



<p>“Spending so many days and nights in a bunker without being able to go out, fearing that your life may end within a seconds, I can just imagine how people can be traumatised.</p>



<p>“There were young kids there, there were women, there were old people.”</p>



<p>UN coordinator Osnat Lubrani said: “Over the past days, travelling with the evacuees, I’ve heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling.</p>



<p>“There is the fear of death and an extreme lack of water, food and ­sanitation. They have spoken of the hell they have experienced since this war started, seeking refuge at the Azovstal plant.”</p>



<p>Yelena Tsybulchenko, who was on the convoy, said: “You can’t imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking.</p>



<p>“We were praying to God that missiles fly over our ­shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done.”</p>

<p>MADELEINE McCann investigators last night claimed they have found evidence in the camper van of prime suspect Christian B — amid speculation it is tell-tale fibres from her pink Eeyore pyjamas.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3428293/who-madeleine-mccann-parents-gerry-kate-brothers-sisters/">Parents Kate and Gerry</a> marked 15 years since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">the three-year-old’s </a>disappearance at a service in Rothley, Leics, yesterday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/11857827/madeleine-mccann-still-alive-german-prosecutor/">Hans-Christian Wolters</a>, heading the case against <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">the German paedo and rapist</a>, said: “We have found new facts and new evidence.</p>



<p>“It’s not forensic evidence but evidence and because of our evidence, we are sure he is the murderer of Madeleine McCann. We are sure he killed Madeleine.”</p>



<p>His admission came after he was pressed on TV over claims that evidence was recovered from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12264113/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-camper-van-fit-child-cellar/">B’s camper van</a>. </p>



<p>There was speculation that this was fibres from the missing tot’s pyjamas.</p>

<p>Mr Wolters was interviewed by Portuguese TV sleuth Sandra Felgueiras on the 15th anniversary of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2238940/madeleine-mccann-investigation-latest-theories/">Madeleine’s disappearance</a>.</p>



<p>The three-year-old was wearing patterned pink Winnie the Pooh Eeyore pyjamas when taken in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8640677/where-praia-da-luz-holiday-madeleine-mccann/">Praia da Luz, Portugal</a>. No trace of them has ever been unearthed.</p>



<p>But rumours recently surfaced that something had been found in the yellow-and-white VW driven by Christian B at the time.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters was asked about the “telltale” fibres during Ms Felgueiras’ show. She asked: “Is it true you did find something belonging to Madeleine in the caravan of Christian B?”</p>

<p>Mr Wolters said: “I can’t comment on details of the investigation.”</p>



<p>Ms Felgueiras added: “But you can’t deny it, can you?”</p>



<p>Mr Wolters replied: “I don’t want to deny it” — and qualified his statement later, adding “because the suspect has not yet been informed”.</p>



<p>Under German law, details of a police investigation cannot be made public until a suspect and their legal team are given full details of the case against them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/">Christian B</a>, 45, has always denied any involvement in Madeleine’s abduction. </p>



<p>This week he claimed he was miles from where Madeleine was taken, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18437253/madeleine-mccann-accused-claims-woman-sex-cops-alibi/">was instead having sex in his van with a woman willing to back his alibi</a>.</p>



<p>But any forensic or DNA traces linking B to Madeleine would be certain to accelerate police efforts to finally charge him with her abduction and murder.</p>

<figure id="attachment_18452249" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 718px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730430743.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=708" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18452249" width="708" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Paul Tonge</figcredit></figure>Madeleine McCann&#8217;s parents, Kate and Gerry, mark the 15th anniversary of their daughter&#8217;s disappearance from Portugal at a vigil in their home village[/caption]



<p>Mr Wolters declined to give details when asked whether he was also certain that B was the person who took Madeleine from her parents’ <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3429820/where-madeleine-mccann-vanish-portugal-ocean-club-praia-da-luz/">Ocean Club holiday apartment</a> — suggesting he may have had an accomplice.</p>



<p>Ms Felgueiras, a presenter on Portugal’s CMTV, said yesterday: “I am certain B did it and the Portuguese police know he worked with an accomplice.” </p>



<h2 id="rape-charge">RAPE CHARGE</h2>



<p>News of the evidence broke as it was revealed B will face up to ten more years in jail as he will face another rape charge within days. </p>



<p>He has been jailed in Germany <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/11798061/madeleine-mccann-suspect-raped-us-touristnearby-villa/">for the rape of a US pensioner in Praia in 2005</a>, two years before Madeleine’s disappearance. </p>



<p>His parole bid was rejected last month. Authorities deemed him a risk to the public and ruled he must stay behind bars until at least next May when another parole hearing is scheduled.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters told The Sun yesterday that he hoped to charge the predator soon over Madeleine’s ­disappearance.</p>



<p>But Christian B will first be served papers detailing his alleged rape of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11816883/irish-woman-raped-algarve-madeleine-mccann-suspect/">Irish tour rep Hazel Behan</a>.</p>



<p>If he is convicted and sentenced to ten more years it will allow the Madeleine probe to continue without fear of him fleeing justice.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12191204/rape-irish-woman-madeleine-mccann/">Hazel</a>, who has waived her right to anonymity, told how her 2004 ordeal was virtually identical to the US pensioner’s.</p>



<p>Describing the horror inside her home in Praia da Rocha near Luz, she said: “There was a masked man dressed in tights and what resembled a leotard, a machete around 12ins long in his hand.”</p>



<p>The rapist set up a video camera in the room and told Hazel not to scream as he dragged her into the living room and tied her to a counter-top. </p>



<p>He then produced a bag of whips and chains and used scissors to remove her clothing before gagging her with a cloth.</p>



<h2 id="threatened-with-machete">THREATENED WITH MACHETE</h2>



<p>Hazel, now 39, said she was raped for up to five hours before the attacker threatened her with a machete when she refused to perform a sex act on him.</p>



<p>She added: “My hands were still tied behind my back and he leaned me over a small bench and put a sheet over my head.</p>



<p>“I thought my life was over. But underneath the sheet I watched as he backed out of the door, put on his shoes and ran away down the street.”</p>

<p>KATE McCann fought back tears at a vigil for Madeleine yesterday — as children lit candles for the tot and other lost youngsters.</p>
<p>She and husband Gerry were pictured for the first time in ­public in four years.</p>
<p>They thanked around 100 wellwishers at the half-hour gathering in Rothley, Leics.</p>
<p>Medic Kate, 54, read a poem saying: “Survival can be summed up in three words. Never give up.</p>
<p>“That’s the heart of it really, just keep trying. Sometimes you have to get knocked down. Lower than you have ever been. To stand up taller than you ever were. Perseverance is stubbornness.”</p>
<p>The couple, who have twins Sean and Amelie, now 17, also bowed their heads in prayer.</p>
<p>The annual event had been cancelled over the past two years because of Covid restrictions.</p>
<p>A family source said: “Kate and Gerry enjoy going to the service for a time of prayer and quiet reflection. They always appreciate the support of the public.”</p>
<p>In a post to mark the vigil, Kate and Gerry said: “This year we mark 15 years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It’s a very long time.</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the ongoing work and commitment of the UK, Portuguese and German authorities as it is this combined police effort which will yield results and bring those answers.”</p>
<p>Their post was accompanied by a phrase from author AA Milne, with a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, saying: “But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart, I’ll always be with you.”</p>

<p>A spokesman for Mr Wolters, who is based in Braunschweig, northern Germany, said of the Hazel case: “The investigation is practically complete.</p>



<p>“The defence attorney will shortly be given access to the files and given the opportunity to comment on the allegations.</p>



<p>“As a rule, such proceedings are then heard about six months to one year after the indictment. In both cases, the investigation was very difficult due to the time that had passed since the crime.</p>



<p>“We’ll be granting access to files in the Hazel B case in a few days. Then Christian B knows what evidence we have collected against him.</p>



<p>“From this point on, nothing is secret any more. In the McCann case, however, this isn’t the case.”</p>



<h2 id="locked-up">LOCKED UP</h2>



<p>B is in prison in the city of Oldenburg, where he is serving seven years for raping the 82-year-old American woman.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters stressed that his team will still not be handing over any evidence to B&#8217;s legal team soon, as part of the prosecution strategy “not to jeopardise these investigations”.</p>



<p>B is also being probed over an allegation that he exposed himself to a ten-year-old girl on a beach in Portugal in April 2007.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Portuguese prosecutors yesterday revealed their recent move to declare him a suspect, or “arguido”, in the Madeleine case gave them eight more years to gather evidence.</p>



<p>Statute of limitations legislation in Portugal could have prevented him from being charged yesterday when a 15-year limit passed.</p>

<p>A BOSS who encourages co-workers to snitch on each other <strong>for eating on the job </strong>has divided opinions. </p>



<p>The brazen sign offers a £15 reward to anyone who rats out their hungry team members &#8211; and promises to punish the offenders. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18451388" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcf0bc00-8047-4f5c-81e3-284815a383f7.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18451388" width="640" height="535" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sign divided opinions on popular discussion forum Reddit</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>A picture of the notice hanging in a restaurant&#8217;s kitchen was posted to Reddit in March with the caption: &#8220;Eat and get laid off. Snitches get $20.&#8221;</p>



<p>It states: &#8220;Warning! All employees must not eat during work hours! Receive a $20 reward if you catch an employee eating during work hours! </p>



<p>&#8220;Employees with 3 warnings will be laid off with no exceptions.&#8221; </p>



<p>Some social media users were stunned at an employer offering a cash incentive to those who turned on their colleagues. </p>

<p>One person said: &#8220;Even from a purely business minded standpoint ignoring how shi**y of a way to treat people is, this is a TERRIBLE idea.&#8221; </p>



<p>One person thought they had worked out the tactic at play, writing: &#8220;Gotta keep us fighting each other to not fight them.&#8221; </p>



<p>Another offered a helpful solution: &#8220;Everyone should band together and repeatedly report the manager.&#8221; </p>



<p>Someone else offered a different way to solve the problem: &#8220;They should all snitch on each other, get the 20 go out for drinks.&#8221; </p>

<p>One person said the boss should consider treading carefully as some people need to eat during the day. </p>



<p>They wrote: &#8220;Try that one with a diabetic employee and brace for impact. The lawsuit won&#8217;t be pretty, but it will set the employee up for a nice payout.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as another boss caused outrage after putting up a sign telling employees that &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18382809/boss-divides-opinion-with-offensive-sign-reddit/">work is not meant to be fun</a>&#8221; alongside a minion character.</p>



<p>The tongue-in-cheek poster received a cold reception on social blogging forum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/reddit/">Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>The poster read: &#8220;Came into work this morning to find this taped to the wall.</p>



<p>&#8220;Boss went on tirade against me and co-worker yesterday for talking to each other with no customers in the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>A DISTURBING picture shows bodies of slaughtered Russian soldiers laid out in a Z shape as brave Ukrainian forces drive Vladimir Putin&#8217;s troops out of Kharkiv.</p>



<p>Streets and fields surrounding the city are reportedly littered with bodies, with journalists describing the outskirts as an &#8220;open-air morgue&#8221;.</p>

<p>Kharkiv has suffered constant bombardment since <a href="https://thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war">the war began</a> late in February &#8211; with many of the city&#8217;s one million terrified residents fleeing to safety.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> fighters battle for control of slivers of land around the country&#8217;s second-biggest city, grisly images have emerged.</p>



<p>One horrifying image appears to show four dead soldiers arranged in a Z shape &#8211; the symbol of Russia&#8217;s bloody invasion &#8211; in a village retaken by Ukrainian forces on Kharkiv&#8217;s outskirts.</p>



<p>According to Associated Press journalists, the dead soldiers were wearing white armbands commonly used by Russian fighters, while Russian medical kits were seen close to the bodies.</p>

<p>It could be considered a war crime.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17744138/russia-tanks-z-symbol-meaning-ukraine-invasion/">Z symbol has been spotted</a>&nbsp;on the sides of Russian military vehicles throughout the war.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17785232/z-russian-tanks-meaning-symbols-explained/#"></a></p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;Russian Ministry of Defence, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/17859979/russia-gymnast-z-war-symbol-ukraine/">&#8220;Z&#8221; symbol means &#8220;for the victory&#8221;</a>  and prevents Russian forces from attacking their own vehicles but also lets opposing forces identify them.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces uncovered a body inside an apartment where they had been taking shelter, as well as two in a burned-out vehicle as they retook a village near Kharkiv.</p>

<p>It comes as Russian troops began storming the steel mill that represented the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, Ukrainian defenders said, just as a convoy carrying scores of civilians evacuated from the plant over the weekend reached the relative safety of a Ukrainian-controlled city.</p>



<p>Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said that thanks to the evacuation effort, 101 women, men, children and older persons could finally leave the bunkers below the Azovstal steelworks and see the daylight after two months.</p>



<p>The news for those left behind was more grim, however, as Ukrainian fighters said Russian forces started storming the sprawling plant, which includes a maze of tunnels and bunkers.</p>



<p>Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraines Azov Regiment, said the Russians were mounting a heavy assault with the support of armored vehicles and tanks, with attempts to land troops from boats and a large number of infantry.</p>



<p>The number of Ukrainian fighters holed up inside was unclear, but the Russians estimated the number at 2,000 weeks ago, and there were reports that 500 were wounded. </p>



<p>A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.</p>



<p>He said that throughout the night, the plant was hit with naval artillery fire and airstrikes. Two civilian women were killed and 10 civilians were wounded, he said.</p>



<p>After failing to take Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, Russia withdrew from around the capital and announced that its chief objective was the capture of Ukraine&#8217;s eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.</p>

<p>But so far, Russias troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains in the eastern offensive.</p>



<p>They have only taken several small towns as they try to advance in relatively compact groups against staunch Ukrainian resistance.</p>

<p>THIS is the terrifying moment a Brit zookeeper was dragged away by a lion before being savaged.</p>



<p>Distressing footage has emerged online after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6185962/mike-hodge-attacked-lion-south-africa-survive-makarele-predator-centre/">Mike Hodge</a> was attacked by the big cat at Makarele Predator Centre in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mike and his British family ran the lion reserve together at Thabazimbi, which grew from a sanctuary they initially built for breeding, and to keep lions in safe surroundings.</p>



<p>In the footage, which has reappeared on Reddit this week, the lion spots Mike after he enters its enclosure and chases him towards the metal door of the facility.</p>



<p>In astonishing scenes, the elderly park owner is dragged like a rag doll towards some bushes.</p>



<p>Onlookers scream for help while the animal paws Mike, who does not appear to be moving.</p>

<p>But the predator remains near the victim while more shots are fired into the air.</p>



<p>One girl who is watching the attack is heard crying in horror as another man shouts for someone to “get a rifle”.</p>



<p>A ranger was forced to shoot Shamba dead after the lion refused to move away from the 72-year-old following warning shots.</p>

<p>He suffered severe bite and claw wounds to his neck and back and had a broken jaw in the 2018 attack.</p>

<p>A MUM has issued an urgent car seat warning after her infant son was left fighting for his life after sustaining a fractured skull in a horrific car crash.</p>



<p>Zoe ten Broek and her 10-month-old boy Jaxon were involved in a horror car accident that also left him with a bleed on his brain and torn neck ligaments.</p>

<p>Despite his injuries, Zoe said the youngster <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18143612/man-killed-woman-fighting-life-carnage-horror-crash/">wouldn&#8217;t have survived</a> had he not been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/1664282/children-car-seat-age-legally-travel/">strapped into the car</a> facing the rear of the vehicle. </p>



<p>Zoe, from Melbourne, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a>, said she&#8217;s been placing baby Jax in backwards ever since he was born and shared her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/16908153/highway-code-changes-2022/">safety advice</a> with The Sun Online.</p>



<p>Recounting what happened on that fateful day two years ago, the mum-of-one said: &#8220;I put Jax in his seat, did a pinch test on his straps, and then started to make my way to my parents&#8217; house just like I have done so many times in the past. Though this time we never made it there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead, the next thing I remember was men putting me in an ambulance and telling me that I had been in an accident.</p>

<p>Zoe was rushed to a hospital with a broken collar bone and minor concussion while her son was airlifted an hour away to the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>



<p>The next 24 hours while Zoe was receiving treatment were an agonising blur.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was very sad I wasn’t going to be with Jax and that he was going to be alone,&#8221; she told us.</p>



<p>&#8220;My parents went with him but I couldn&#8217;t. I was wondering what kind of a state he was in because emergency crews weren’t telling me anything. It was that bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had thoughts running through my head like how bad is it? Am I going to lose him?&#8221;</p>



<p>Zoe was eventually discharged and rushed to her son&#8217;s hospital bedside where the sight of him hooked up to life support left her &#8220;terrified&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing could have prepared me for seeing my little man in that massive bed with so many tubes and wires everywhere,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;He had a swollen head and eyes and was all bandaged up.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was even a big sticker that said he had a piece of bone in his head removed. It was terrifying. It was really terrifying,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Doctors said Jax had sustained severe brain trauma and had fractured his skull which resulted in a bleed and a torn ligament in his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was touch and go for a while, but four surgeries, four weeks in hospital, and many tears later I was thankfully lucky enough to be able to take my boy home without any permanent issues,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The 23-year-old was later told an oncoming car clipped the tyres of her Volkswagen&nbsp;Golf, spinning it out of control and into the direct path of a third vehicle that T-boned her at 100km/h (60mph) &#8220;exactly where Jax was sitting&#8221;.</p>



<p>It took the tot&nbsp;four months to recover in hospital and many more after returning home.</p>



<p>Zoe says that &#8220;not a day goes by&#8221; when she doesn&#8217;t think about how things might have turned out had she not strapped him in rearward facing.</p>



<p>Doctors told her after the crash that young Jax wouldn&#8217;t have survived had he been facing the front of the vehicle.</p>



<p>She warned: &#8220;If you have already started forward facing your young child please reconsider.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is safest to keep your child rearward facing until they reach the forward-facing markers on your car seat.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;The research has shown time and time again that young children are very top-heavy and if they’re forward-facing, their head will smack forward and literally break their neck so they will be instantly dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they’re rear-facing, that doesn’t happen. </p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn’t bend forward and the car seat absorbs all of that impact. </p>



<p>&#8220;So, if young children get into severe accidents like this, they could actually survive it.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Zoe, Jax recently got an MRI done and was given the all-clear by neurosurgeons. </p>



<p>&#8220;Jax is really just your average toddler now. He is developmentally behind in talking (non verbal atm) and was very delayed in walking. </p>



<p>&#8220;Was it because of the head trauma? We’ll never know. But he’s thriving in all other areas!&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m very grateful I still have him in my life and I can still hear him laugh and watch him grow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite it all, Jax is now a happy young tot who will turn three in August.</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s amazing. He’s a little social butterfly, super affectionate and super happy. He’s my little lover-boy,&#8221; Zoe said.</p>



<p>But there are still moments when memories of the crash come flooding in, especially when the two are on the road together.</p>

<p>&#8220;That morning of the crash, it was a little bit rainy so when it does rain, and we’re going on a road that is 100km/h, I can be a little bit triggered by it. I think, ‘Ok, this takes me back to being at the accident.&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;But, we’re fine and Jax is fine in the car. He loves going for rides. No problems.&#8221;</p>

<p>A LUCKY man found nearly £6MILLION hidden inside a storage unit he bought at an auction &#8211; before a shocking twist saw him lose millions.</p>



<p>The treasure hunter found the jaw-dropping amount in a second-hand storage unit he bought at an auction for £390.</p>

<p>Auctioneer Dan Dotson, who is the host of the US TV show Storage Wars, revealed in 2018 that one of his buyers made the amazing finding after their bid at the auction. </p>



<p>In a clip shared on social media, he explained he was approached by a woman at a charity event in California who told him about the fortune.</p>



<p>Dan said: “An older Asian woman at the table next to me kept looking at me like she wanted to tell me something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eventually she walked up and told me her husband works with a guy who bought a unit from me for $500 and found a safe inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the first person they called to open it I guess couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>“They called a second person and when that person opened it up &#8211; inside the safe they&#8217;re normally empty, but this time it wasn&#8217;t empty.</p>



<p>“It had $7.5million (£5.8m) cash inside.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the lucky buyer wasn&#8217;t able to keep the fortune as he eventually had to return the cash to its original owners.</p>

<p>Dan told&nbsp;<a href="https://theblast.com/storage-wars-dan-dotson-sells-unit-7-5-million-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Blast</a> at the time, that the treasure hunter was contacted by an attorney, claiming to represent the original owners of the unit.</p>



<p>The lawyer reportedly offered a £465,000 reward for the money but that offer was turned down.</p>



<p>However, the second offer of £930,000 was later accepted which meant that the anonymous lucky buyer had to return the rest of the cash.</p>



<p>Dan wondered how can anyone forget such a big amount of money hidden in a safe.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;$7.5million inside of a unit, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d forget it but maybe you were just in a position where somebody else was in charge of it, I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<h2>What is the meaning of Cinco de Mayo?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14854759/cinco-de-mayo-celebration-america-mexico-us/">Cinco de Mayo</a> is an annual celebration recognizing the Mexican army&#8217;s victory over the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/">French</a> at the Battle of Puebla in 1862.</p>
<p>The battle, which took place as the French attempted to carve out a new empire in Mexican territory, helped slow down the invading force&#8217;s advance on Mexico City.</p>
<p>The Battle of Puebla lasted from daybreak until early evening and forced the French to retreat after they lost nearly 500 soldiers while the Mexican force lost fewer than 100 men.</p>

<p>Cinco de Mayo was first celebrated in California in 1863 during the Civil War as a celebration of Mexican culture and heritage. However, the holiday wasn&#8217;t fully recognized in the US until the 1960s when Chicano activists raised awareness and it became a national holiday.</p>
<p>Despite the celebrations in the US, Cinco de Mayo isn&#8217;t as widely celebrated in Mexico. It is not a bank holiday, is typically treated as any other day, and is primarily celebrated in Puebla where the battle took place.</p>

<h2>How is Cinco de Mayo celebrated in Mexico v. the US?</h2>
<p>Cinco de Mayo is not a national holiday in Mexico as banks and businesses remain open but it is celebrated in Puebla, the site of the French-Mexican war.</p>
<p>Schools are closed and the region celebrates with recreations of the Battle of Puebla and military parades which typically hosts about 20k attendees. The parade includes Mariachi bands, dancing, and fireworks.</p>
<p>In the US, Cinco de Mayo has become a holiday to commemorate Mexican culture and has become one of the top five drinking holidays in the country alongside the Super Bowl, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/17795792/mardi-gras-king-cake-where-buy-one/">Mardi Gras</a>, Labor Day, and the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>The holiday is also celebrated with Mexican-inspired food including tacos, enchiladas, and chile rellenos.</p>

<p>FROM so-called Doomsday planes to Vladimir Putin&#8217;s top secret nuke briefcase, there are signs Russia could be preparing to spark a nuclear World War Three.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> has already <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">warned he will use nuclear weapons</a> against the West if anyone interferes in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> &#8211; but Britain has downplayed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> warnings as &#8220;bravado&#8221;. </p>

<p>The spectre of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18049057/russia-threat-nuke-west-if-nato-peacekeepers-enter-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuclear war</a>&nbsp;has loomed over the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine conflict</a> after Putin&#8217;s war machine was crippled by the fierce Ukrainian resistance &#8211; sparking fears the tyrant could use nukes to break the deadlock.</p>



<p>But UK defence secretary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15963472/who-is-defence-secretary-ben-wallace/">Ben Wallace</a> has tried to pour cold water on the growing fears, describing the situation as a &#8220;battle of rhetoric&#8221;.</p>



<p>He told&nbsp;BBC Breakfast: &#8220;This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table just to remind people, remind the world, that he has a deterrent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although experts said the chance of Putin using nuclear weapons to spark a world war is unlikely, there are signs Putin could be preparing to start a nuclear conflict. </p>

<h2 id="doomsday-planes">DOOMSDAY PLANES</h2>



<p>One of Putin’s special <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13416951/vladimir-putin-doomsday-plane-robbed/">so-called Doomsday planes</a> for use in the event of a nuclear war with the West has been seen flying around Moscow in recent days.</p>



<p>A chilling video showed the Ilyushin Il-80 passing low over the outskirts of the capital.</p>



<p>The windowless Il-80 is one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1540302/putins-nuclear-war-dodging-doomsday-plane-fleet-now-upgraded-as-often-as-the-iphone/">four planes</a>&nbsp;designed to act as a flying Kremlin in the sky in the event of a nuclear attack.</p>



<p>Putin would be able to rule Russia and issue commands to his military – including ordering nuke strikes &#8211; from the airborne command post.</p>

<p>The US equivalent are the Boeing E-4B planes based on the 747 airliner.</p>



<p>Russian officials confirmed the aircraft will be showcased with a low flypast at Monday’s annual Victory Day parade on Red Square &#8211; and it has been involved in &#8220;rehearsals&#8221; for the display.</p>



<p>The giant Soviet-era aircraft has not been seen at a Victory Day commemoration since 2010.</p>



<p>Its reappearance is a thought to be a sign Putin wants to send a warning message to the West.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18053215/doomsday-plane-survive-nuclear-blasts-flight-europe/#"></a></p>



<h2 id="nuclear-briefcase">NUCLEAR BRIEFCASE</h2>



<p>Putin has also been spotted several times around what appears to be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18243248/putin-secret-nuclear-briefcase-vows-fight-ukraine-till-end/">Russia’s secret nuclear briefcase</a>.</p>



<p>Last month, he arrived at the Vostochny Cosmodrome via helicopter to visit a space port with Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko.</p>



<p>Putin&nbsp;arrived on the scene accompanied by his top military henchman who were seen carrying the alleged launch device &#8211; just days after it was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18207871/putin-secret-nuclear-briefcase-world-war-three/">snapped at a state funeral.</a></p>



<p>The secret case is thought to contain the launch apparatus for the Kremlin&#8217;s strategic missiles and its presence at the funeral is seen as a chilling threat to the world.</p>



<p>The bag, which has a personalised key code, is normally under 24/7 supervision and completely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1914308/russia-nuclear-war-putin-atomic-weapon/">controls Moscow&#8217;s nuclear arsenal.</a></p>



<p>It is reportedly supervised by an armed security officer who accompanies no-nonsense Putin wherever he travels.</p>



<p>The briefcase, called Cheget in Russian,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5372365/america-russia-nuclear-weapons-mini-nukes/">was developed in the early 1980s</a>&nbsp;and was shown to the world for first time in 2019, with its contents being viewed up close on TV.</p>



<p>According to local media, there are actually not just one<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9914128/putin-nuclear-missile-anywhere-in-the-world-six-years-fears-new-arms-race/">&nbsp;but three in total.</a></p>



<p>Its visible presence in recent weeks is thought to be a chilling sign that the crazed Russian leader could deploy devastating nuclear weapons at any time.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18243248/putin-secret-nuclear-briefcase-vows-fight-ukraine-till-end/#"></a></p>



<h2 id="state-tv-s-chilling-threats">STATE TV&#8217;S CHILLING THREATS</h2>



<p>Russian state TV has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18435090/russian-threatens-nuclear-annihilation-uk-radiation-tsunami/">threatened to drown the UK</a> under a radioactive tsunami in a bizarre propaganda video.</p>



<p>In the chilling broadcast the presenter also showed how the Kremlin&#8217;s latest world-ending Satan 2 nuclear missile could also annihilate Britain.</p>



<p>Brazen host Dmitry Kiselyov heralded Russia’s second option to “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea&#8221; with its “underwater robotic drone Poseidon”.</p>



<p>In a chilling graphic he warned the missile would raise a giant tsunami wave up to 1,640ft high.</p>

<p>He later predicted the surging water &#8211; reaching almost halfway up England&#8217;s tallest mountain Scafell Pike in the Lake District &#8211; would contain “high doses of radiation” turning what is left of Britain into a “radioactive desert”.</p>



<p>His threat was based on the &#8220;baseless&#8221;&nbsp;claims from Russian state media in the past week that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>&nbsp;had threatened to carry out a nuclear strike on Russia without consulting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato.</a></p>



<p>Downing Street dismissed this as “another example of disinformation peddled by the Kremlin&#8221;.</p>



<h2 id="satan-2-nuke-test">&#8216;SATAN 2&#8217; NUKE TEST</h2>



<p>Pro-Putin&nbsp;TV pundits have also previously threatened the use of the world ending&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18358256/putin-boasts-satan-2-nuclear-missile-break-through-defences/">RS-28 Sarmat missile</a>&nbsp;– gleefully spouting its ability to wipe England from the map.</p>



<p>Putin boasted that his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18358256/putin-boasts-satan-2-nuclear-missile-break-through-defences/">apocalyptic &#8220;Satan 2&#8221; nuke missile</a> can &#8220;break through any defences&#8221;.</p>



<p>The tyrant said the world-ending RS-28 Sarmat would &#8220;force those who try to threaten Russia to think twice&#8221;.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18358256/putin-boasts-satan-2-nuclear-missile-break-through-defences/#"></a></p>



<p>The deadly projectile can fly over 11,000 miles, carry 15 warheads and has the potential to destroy an area the size of the United Kingdom in a single strike.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s said to be the world&#8217;s longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>



<p>The separate warheads are capable of detaching from the main 100-tonne missile before travelling towards their target at hypersonic speeds.</p>



<p>The bombs are 1,000 times more powerful than those dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War Two.</p>



<p>Putin said: &#8220;The missile can break through all modern anti-missile defences.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is nothing like this anywhere in the world, and won&#8217;t be for a long time.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="nuke-bunkers">NUKE BUNKERS</h2>



<p>Putin and his inner circle were reportedly <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18097861/paranoid-putin-living-top-secret-nuke-bunkers-nuclear-war/">living in top-secret nuclear bunkers</a> in March following the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The use of the high-security bunkers suggests Putin could be preparing to deploy nuclear weapons &#8211; a move that would lead to inevitable reprisal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Movements of planes used by top Kremlin officials in March showed Putin might have been in a hideaway near Surgut in western Siberia.</p>



<p>For a period of time, Putin&#8217;s defence minister Sergei Shoigu is said to have hidden out in a bunker near Ufa in the Urals, 725 miles east of Moscow, according to investigative journalist&nbsp;Christo Grozev.</p>



<p>The theory was backed by his daughter Ksenia Shoigu, 31, visiting Ufa for perhaps three days from March 22 as speculation was rife that the defence minister had suffered heart problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grozev &#8211; who has links to British investigative outlet Bellingcat &#8211; said at the time: &#8220;I am absolutely sure that Shoigu is in a bunker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tracking the movement of his plane, we see very frequent flights to Ufa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Knowing that there are also protected bunkers in this region, this gives an obvious answer about his place of residence.&#8221;</p>



<p>He believes Putin another bunker elsewhere.</p>

<p>Previously there have been claims Putin had moved his close relatives to a bunker in the Altai Mountains &#8211; some 1,100 miles southeast of Surgut and 2,360 miles east of Moscow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also claims that Putin took time out in the pandemic late last year to inspect emergency bunkers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin could be killed in a coup over the shambolic Ukraine invasion as he has &#8220;no future&#8221; if the war doesn&#8217;t succeed, a former US general has warned.</p>



<p>Senior figures in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> army and security services <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398930/vladimir-putin-generals-ukraine-war-disaster-coup/">have become increasingly frustrated</a> with the weak and sickly tyrant&#8217;s handling of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a>.</p>

<p>But General Jack Keane said <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> will &#8220;do anything&#8221; to stay in power as he knows the alternative would be his &#8220;demise&#8221;. </p>



<p>The former Vice Chief of Staff of the US Army told Fox News: &#8220;He&#8217;s all about staying in power. That&#8217;s his motivation. He will do anything to stay in power.</p>



<p>&#8220;The alternative, he knows full well, by a successor who doesn&#8217;t agree with him, could mean the end of him &#8211; his demise. </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fighting to stay in power and he&#8217;s determined, I think, to still accomplish his goals even though his focus is in the south [of Ukraine]. </p>

<p>&#8220;He still wants to take the country over, topple the regime &#8211; and I take Putin seriously. I think many of us discounted him for a number of years, but he is about returning to the Russian Empire.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think as long as he&#8217;s in power, he will be in pursuit of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;He has no future beyond him being the president of Russia. That&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is thought Russia&#8217;s army generals want to be let off the leash to storm <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> &#8211; and even go to war with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a> after accusing the West of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">fighting a proxy war against Moscow</a> via its support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>The powerful Russian &#8220;siloviki&#8221; &#8211; or security bloc &#8211;&nbsp;have reportedly blamed Putin for a &#8220;serious error&#8221; after retreating from the capital of Kyiv and concentrating on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">taking control of the Donbas in the east</a>.</p>



<p>Russia had expected it could march across Ukraine without much of a fight &#8211; but in reality they have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance.</a></p>



<p>Last month, Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces out of Kyiv and managed to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles east of the capital in a major victory.</p>



<p>The Kremlin declared that the first stage of its campaign to “denazify and demilitarise” Ukraine was a success despite the retreat of Russian troops &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18067717/russia-defeated-kremlin-focus-only-liberating-separatists/">and it&#8217;ll now focus its efforts on breakaway province Donetsk.</a></p>



<p>The mounting frustration from Russia&#8217;s top army and intelligence chiefs over the war also comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/">rumours swirl around the state of Putin&#8217;s physical health</a>.</p>



<p>A Kremlin insider reportedly claimed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18422816/putin-undergo-cancer-operation/">he is set to undergo an operation for cancer</a> and will hand over power to his hardline spy chief.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s thought the Russian dictator could now face an uprising from his inner circle amid the unprecedented criticism and growing demand for “all-out war&#8221; and &#8220;mobilisation&#8221;.</p>



<p>New intelligence analysis suggested he could be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18141050/vladimir-putin-ousted-two-years/">ousted in a &#8220;palace coup&#8221; staged by his cronies within two year</a>s.</p>



<p>Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov told The Center for European Policy Analysis: &#8220;Does it matter? It matters a lot. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is the very first time the siloviki are putting distance between themselves and the president. Which opens up all sorts of possibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Putin is already bracing for a possible military coup after he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18242246/putin-military-coup-purging-spies-ukraine/">purged 150 spies over the invasion</a> of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The mad tyrant launched a &#8220;Stalinist&#8221; purge of his intelligence services &#8211; including sending spy chief Sergei Beseda to prison.</p>



<p>But the FSB &#8211; headed up by Sergei Naryshkin &#8211; is reportedly still pushing for hardline military action in Ukraine despite the jailing of its top boss.</p>



<p>And Alexander Arutyunov, a veteran Russian Spetsnaz&nbsp;officer, shared a video in pro-military groups pleading with Putin to escalate the war.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, please decide, are we fighting a war&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;or are we pleasuring ourselves?”</p>



<p>The ex-military intelligence commander&nbsp;said: “Strike them all over, completely destroy all their aerodromes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Turn them into Moon craters so that not a single plane with a Bayraktar [military drone] can take off.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must destroy all their railway lines with missiles of such big size that they spend years&nbsp;repairing&nbsp;them…</p>



<p>&#8220;If I understand it, why don’t your top guys get it? This is beyond me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Russia analyst&nbsp;Alexey Muraviev has previously warned that Putin faces a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18141050/vladimir-putin-ousted-two-years/">potential coup</a> from within his military and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Mr Muraviev told Sky News Australia that the coup may come as they want to try and win the war &#8211; not to stop aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I think that there have been tensions between Russia and the intelligence community and Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because clearly, there&#8217;s been a clear error of judgment that was made and it was probably driven by Putin himself about the situation in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;About the initial planning and the initial phase of the invasion where the Russian military naturally assume that they&#8217;re going there as liberators rather than the invaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that sort of false narrative was presented to them by the Supreme Commander in Chief, and when it fired back when the Russians began taking heavy casualties, Putin began quietly blaming the security services.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which I don&#8217;t think went really well also because he&#8217;s coming from within the security apparatus.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>QUESTIONS about the health of Russian President Vladimir Putin have been circulating for many months.</p>



<p>Cancer, Parkinsons&#8217; and dementia have all been mentioned as rumours swirl about <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin&#8217;s</a> health being in decline. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18445711" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f257729a-d3ad-4a90-9c4b-a8609d2690cb.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18445711" width="960" height="650" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Reports say that Vladimir Putin is battling abdominal cancers and Parkinson&#8217;s disease</figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>



<h2 id="is-vladimir-putin-ill">Is Vladimir Putin ill?</h2>



<p>Photos of Vladimir Putin have appeared to show him with a bloated face.</p>



<p>The images were released before Russia was slammed for bombing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17815165/what-happened-at-babyn-yar/">Babyn Yar </a>Holocaust memorial in Kyiv.</p>



<p>Fiona Hill, the British former senior White House expert on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>: &#8220;Putin’s not looking so great, he’s been rather puffy-faced.</p>



<p>Hill added that it is known that the 69-year-old has back issues but it could be &#8220;something worse&#8221;.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;It could be that he’s taking high doses of steroids, or there may be something else.&#8221;</p>



<p>On April 30, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18422816/putin-undergo-cancer-operation/">reports from a Kremlin insider</a> claimed that Putin &#8220;will be undergoing medical procedures.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source confirmed that a date is yet to be confirmed as &#8220;doctors insist that he needs an operation.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="what-health-problems-is-vladimir-putin-alleged-to-have-had">What health problems is Vladimir Putin alleged to have had?</h2>



<p>Putin is as tight-lipped about his health as he is about his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17832079/vladimir-putin-bounty-where-location/">whereabouts</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sees literally everyone, including those inside the Russian security services and even inside his close inner circle, to be &#8216;traitors&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is so suspicious and so obsessed with his paranoia ideas that he can be now compared with Stalin tyrant.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17981023/vladimir-putin-body-language-disease-symptoms/">Body language experts</a> have claimed that Putin could be suffering from a &#8220;serious disease and on the verge of a breakdown&#8221;.</p>



<p>An investigation by Proekt media revealed the tyrant is “constantly” accompanied by a doctor specialising in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18133008/chilling-new-clues-putin-thyroid-cancer-parkinsons/">thyroid cancer</a>.</p>



<p>The report states that thyroid cancer specialist surgeon, Yevgeny Selivanov, has flown to be beside the Russian leader no less than 35 times in the Black Sea resort Sochi.</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid-19</a> pandemic, the world&#8217;s press kept a close eye on Putin as he met more than once with people who would go on to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11296459/coronavirus-fears-putin-shook-hands-tests-positive/">test positive for the virus</a>.</p>



<p>And he was forced to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16133486/vladimir-putin-self-isolate-covid/">self-isolate in September 2021</a>, after several people close to him went down with the virus.</p>



<p>There has been much speculation about his health over the years, with researchers in 2015 claiming they&nbsp;identified signs in&nbsp;Putin&#8217;s gait which could point to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13125878/does-putin-have-parkinsons-who-replace-resigns/">Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a>. </p>



<p>The team spotted how the Russian had a tendency to keep one arm pinned to his side.</p>



<p>It has also been claimed the President had been<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17931327/putin-roid-rage-cancer-treatment/"> treated for cancer.</a></p>



<p>Political analyst Valery Solovei claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13253481/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">Putin underwent surgery</a>&nbsp;in February 2020 and another Russian source went on to claim it was an abdominal cancer operation.</p>



<p>Solovei also went on to suggest that Putin is suffering from symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>



<h2 id="what-has-the-kremlin-said">What has the Kremlin said?</h2>



<p>It is rare for the Kremlin to comment on Putin&#8217;s health, but it did issue a firm denial of the Parkinson&#8217;s disease claims.</p>



<p>Dmitry Peskov, press secretary for Putin, has continued to insist that the Russian President&#8217;s health is &#8220;excellent&#8221;, despite claims to the contrary. </p>

<p>THE prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has been refused early prison release in his sick bid for freedom, it is reported.</p>



<p>Christian B has allegedly been denied parole over the rape of a pensioner in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/praia-da-luz/">Praia da Luz</a> after serving half his sentence.</p>

<p>The decision panel are understood to have held concerns that he was at &#8220;high risk of reoffending&#8221;. </p>



<p>He will remain in prison until at least May 2023 when he can make another parole application, according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/madeleine-mccann-prime-suspect-branded-26853043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>.</p>



<p>Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said: &#8220;His request was rejected on the grounds that he could not be given a positive social prognosis.</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, the court has said it believes that the convict will commit further offences if released.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman spent <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11800974/madeleine-mccann-suspect-rape-victim/">two days with</a> investigators recounting her ordeal in September 2005 — two years before&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2238940/madeleine-mccann-investigation-latest-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club complex in the same Algarve resort</a>.</p>



<p>Christian B escaped justice for 12 years before he was nailed by DNA evidence taken from a hair at the scene. </p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Oldenburg District Court said: &#8220;The court ruled there were no grounds for suspending the remainder of the sentence.&#8221;</p>



<p>The decision will likely be welcomed by investigators working to find links between Christian B and Maddie&#8217;s disappearance. </p>

<p>The parents of Madeleine <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18439160/madeleine-mccanns-parents-need-answers/">told of their &#8220;need for answers&#8221;</a> as they remember her on the poignant 15th anniversary of her disappearance today.</p>



<p>In a heartfelt post on the Find Maddie and Official Campaign websites, the McCanns wrote: &#8220;Many people talk about the need for ‘closure’. It’s always felt a strange term.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of outcome,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">Madeleine</a>&nbsp;will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is true though that uncertainty creates weakness; knowledge and certainty give strength, and for this reason our need for answers, for the truth, is essential.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heart doctor Gerry, 53, and hospital medical worker Kate, 54, from Rothley, Leicestershire, cling onto a glimmer of hope she could still be alive. She would now be aged 18, nearly 19.</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry are expected to join family, friends and supporters for an informal evening service tonight in their village.</p>



<p>The McCanns have welcomed news that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18338001/christian-b-will-stand-trial-over-madeleine-mccanns-disappearance/">Christian B has been made an “arguido&#8221;</a> &#8211; an official suspect.</p>



<p>Wolters believes more &#8220;developments&#8221; are likely within the next three weeks. </p>



<p>Christian B has denied any involvement and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18437253/madeleine-mccann-accused-claims-woman-sex-cops-alibi/">claims he was miles away having sex with a woman in his camper van</a> at the time Madeleine vanished. </p>



<p>He said the next day they were stopped on the way to Faro Airport and had their picture taken at a roadblock. </p>

<figure id="attachment_18443011" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000727967132.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18443011" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>PA</figcredit></figure>Kate and Gerry McCann[/caption]



<p>He claimed the woman was arrested at the airport for carrying a pepper spray &#8211; however an arrest report indicates she was actually detained a week after Madeleine disappeared. </p>



<p>Cops recently forensically tested Christian B&#8217;s van after he was quizzed for first time about the missing girl. </p>



<p>Portuguese cops are waiting for results from the VW van that Christian B drove while living on the Algarve where the three-year-old vanished&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2238940/madeleine-mccann-investigation-latest-theories/">on May 3, 2007</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">The German convicted paedophile</a>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/">questioned by police in Oldenburg jail</a>&nbsp;after authorities named him as an official suspect on Thursday.</p>



<p>Police asked him: &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18348973/mccann-suspect-van-tested-cops/">Where were you the night Madeleine McCann disappeared?</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Christian B was pressed to provide an alibi, adding: &#8220;If you weren’t by the apartment she ­disappeared from, where were you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Insiders close to the case claim he did not answer any of the questions.</p>



<p>It comes after cops in Portugal decided they will continue to investigate Madeleine&#8217;s disappearance despite the Met Police ending its probe.</p>



<p>Sources close to Portuguese authorities said abandoning their ongoing case review was &#8220;completely out of the question&#8221;. </p>



<p>Portugal&#8217;s Attorney General’s Office said an independent inquiry led by prosecutors out of the Algarve will continue.</p>

<p>THIS is the extraordinary moment Ukraine blitzed TWO Russian Navy boats in a deadly drone attack &#8211; sending Putin&#8217;s butchers sinking to a watery grave.</p>



<p>Astonishing footage shows what is understood to be Turkish made <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17957095/ukraine-russia-turkey-drone-bayraktar-tb2/">Bayraktar TB2</a> drones unleashing hell on two fast-attack boats in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The infrared video &#8211; released by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukrainian armed forces</a> &#8211; shows one of the Raptor-class craft floating off the coast of the war ravaged country.</p>



<p>But moments later, it is pounded in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">direct strike from the sky</a>, sending an enormous fireball into the air as it&#8217;s blown to smithereens </p>



<p>While another clip appears to show a boat accelerating shortly before it&#8217;s annihilated in a direct strike &#8211; obliterating the entire vessel in a hellish inferno.</p>



<p>The attacks will be a blow to Mad Vlad given <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> are believed to have only seven Raptor&#8217;s operating in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Raptors can carry up to 20 marines and are armed with 14.5mm and 7.62mm machineguns.</p>



<p>They can travel up to 48 knots (55mph) and are some of the fastest boats in the Russian navy.</p>



<p>Both attacks took place near famous Snake Island where a group of heroic Ukrainian Border guards told the now destroyed Moskva to &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17766686/snake-island-massacre-last-words-ukrainian-soldiers-slaughtered-russia/">go f*** yourself</a>” after it ordered them to surrender. </p>



<p>Russia&nbsp;later captured the island but<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/"> Moskva was sunk by two Neptune anti-ship missiles</a> on April 14 in one of the biggest moments of the war so far.</p>

<p>Following the release of footage, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine’s</a> armed forces, celebrated the sinking&#8217;s.</p>



<p>He wrote on on Facebook: “Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at daybreak today near Snake Island.</p>



<p>“Bayraktar is working.”</p>



<h2 id="death-from-above">DEATH FROM ABOVE</h2>



<p>The unmanned Bayraktar TB2 has caused mayhem for Russia&#8217;s invading forces since the war began &#8211; with footage emerging of the drones destroying Russian missile launchers.</p>



<p>The Turkish death machines can hang menacingly in the air for an astonishing 27-HOURS at an altitude of 25,000 feet.</p>



<p>They are equipped with four laser guided smart ammunition rockets and can dart through the air at 137mph thanks to a 110-horsepower engine.</p>



<p>Bayraktar TB2&#8217;s have become so popular and successful since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine that a song dedicated to the £3.8million drones has been released.</p>



<p>Despite all this, the machines are basic compared to other tech being deployed in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Discussing Bayraktar&#8217;s, drone expert David Hambling told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/are-ukraines-cheap-slow-drones-successful-russian-targets-rcna19982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a>: &#8220;It is literally a World War I aircraft, in terms of performance.&#8221;</p>

	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>Footage of drone strikes on Russian units have been widely shared since the war began on February 24.</p>



<p>One dramatic clip shows the moment a bomb from a Ukrainian drone <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18434767/moment-bomb-ukrainian-drone-sunroof-russian-soldiers-vehicle/">flies through the SUNROOF</a> of a Russian vehicle sending soldiers running for their lives.</p>



<p>While another <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18282697/bomb-dropped-ukrainian-drone-destroys-russian-tank/">extraordinary clip shows the moment</a> a Russian tank was blown to smithereens in a lethal night-time raid by a Ukrainian drone attack.</p>



<p>The drone is understood to be worth only &nbsp;$10,000 a-piece.</p>



<p>Aerorozvidka &#8211; an amateur volunteer unit of the Ukrainian Ground Forces who specialise in drone warfare &#8211; are behind most of the drone attacks in Ukraine.</p>

<p>BORIS Johnson will today echo Winston Churchill in a historic address to the Ukraine parliament — hailing the defence against Vladimir Putin’s war machine as the nation’s “finest hour”.</p>



<p>Speaking by video link, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/">the Prime Minister</a> will set out details of a new £300million package of military support.</p>

<p>Downing Street said last night it will include electronic warfare equipment, a radar system, GPS jamming kit and thousands of night-vision devices.</p>



<p>His address to the Verkhovna Rada follows his unannounced visit to capital Kyiv last month and is another show of solidarity with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">President Volodymyr Zelensky</a>.</p>



<p>Mr Johnson will say: “When my country faced the threat of invasion during the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/">Second World War</a>, our Parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict.</p>



<p>“And the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour.</p>

<p>“This is Ukraine’s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come.</p>



<p>“Your children and grandchildren will say that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainians</a> taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.”</p>



<p>The famous Finest Hour speech by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/winston-churchill/">Churchill</a> was made just after the fall of France in 1940.</p>



<p>In March, Mr Zelensky received thunderous applause from MPs as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/17885678/zelenskyy-makes-historic-address-to-mps/">he addressed Parliament by video</a> and channelled Churchill’s “We will fight them on the beaches” speech.</p>

<p>Speaking from his Kyiv bunker, he vowed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> invaders would be defeated “on the sea and in the air”. He pledged: “We will fight for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.”</p>



<p>New British aid for Ukraine will also include long-range Brimstone missiles and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer air defence vehicles</a>, along with heavy lift aerial drones to provide logistical support to isolated units.</p>



<p>However, an investigation is reportedly under way into how UK-made components came to be used in weapons deployed by Russia.</p>



<p>The Royal United Services Institute said an abandoned Borisoglebsk-2 mobile jamming system was found to contain components made in the UK, US, Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the first civilians to flee the “Alamo” Azovstal steel plant in blitzed Mariupol were due to reach the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia last night.</p>



<p>Around 100 people — mostly women and children — <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433015/ukraine-war-mariupul-steel-factory-civilians/">escaped the sprawling steel plant</a> in a major humanitarian breakthrough on Sunday.</p>



<p>More were due to follow after Mr Zelensky signalled the UN and Red Cross-backed mission would resume at 8am yesterday.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba confirmed it was “under way” but declined to say how many people were involved.</p>



<p>He warned: “Everything is very fragile. Things can fall apart at any given moment so it’s better to wait until the evacuation is over.”</p>



<p>Around 2,000 troops and 500 civilians were trapped in tunnels and bunkers where soldiers have made a desperate last stand in the final part of the city still under Ukrainian control.</p>



<p>Yesterday, European football chiefs confirmed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/18439498/russia-champions-league-celtic-rangers/">Russian teams would be excluded</a> from next season’s Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.</p>



<p>Uefa also banned Russia from the Women’s European Championship in England in July and from participating in qualifying for next year’s women’s World Cup.</p>



<p>Russia’s bids to host the men’s Euros in 2028 and 2032 were also thrown out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EU politicians remain split over how the Bloc can wean itself off Russian energy supplies.</p>



<p>Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck said his country is not ready to block gas but could cope with an oil ban by the end of the year. Hungary is opposed to banning both Russian oil and gas.</p>

<p>A CAT that survived four WEEKS stranded in a shelled block of flats in Ukraine has finally been rescued by big-hearted animal lovers.</p>



<p>The feline &#8211; which miraculously survived a rocket strike from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin&#8217;s</a> butchers &#8211; was saved from the seventh floor in a suburb of Kyiv after a mammoth social media campaign.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18440531" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 832px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fdb5ed11-4644-4420-8f9f-c56ec0257851-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=822" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440531" width="822" height="653" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The cat was stranded on the seventh floor of the devastated apartment block for four WEEKS</figcaption><figcredit>Cover Images</figcredit></figure>

<p>Astonishing pictures show how a hero rescue team in war ravaged Borodyanka scrambled to save the fearless creature from the terrifying height, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10775377/OMG-Ukraine-thank-saving-kitty-Incredible-mission-save-lone-cat-survived-bombing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a> reported.</p>



<p>A team led by local hero Eugene Kibets &#8211; who had responded to desperate calls online to save the cat &#8211; used a fire engine with a crane to reach the stranded animal high up in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18440038/shocking-footage-russian-missile/">charred building</a>.</p>



<p>A brave emergency services worker then climbed the vertigo educing crane to grab the cat, which can be seen peaking over the edge of a blown out apartment. </p>



<p>The kitty &#8211; which is likely to have used up at least one of its nine lives throughout the saga &#8211; is now being treated at a local animal clinic, where she was started eating again.</p>

<p>Prior to the rescue, Mr Kibets knew the scale of the challenge ahead, writing: &#8220;The cat is on the 7th floor of a non-existent house.&#8221;</p>



<p>But when he and his team finally accomplished the daring effort, he posed with the cat in his arms and simply wrote: &#8220;I’m so happy!!!!!!!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cat fan Lorenzo the Cat wrote on Twitter: &#8220;Holy S*** he did it! Eugene Kibets got the cat from the 7th floor of a bombed building.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know this is crazy, but amid the horror of war we have to celebrate the good in humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE parents of Madeleine McCann have told of their “need for answers” as they remember her on the poignant 15th anniversary of her disappearance tomorrow &#8211; which they say is &#8220;a very long time&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry said tonight: &#8220;This year we mark fifteen years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It’s a very long time.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18440006" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000634909506.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440006" width="960" height="676" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>Gerry and Kate McCann say they &#8216;need answers&#8217;[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18440007" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000727967220-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18440007" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>PA</figcredit></figure>Their daughter Maddie vanished 15 years ago[/caption]



<p>The brave couple, who are due to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433337/madeleine-mccann-parents-prayer-service/">join well wishers in their home village to pray for their daughter</a>, told how they found the phrase needing “closure” a difficult term.</p>



<p>In a heartfelt posting on the eve of the milestone anniversary on the Find Maddie and Official Campaign websites, the McCanns wrote: &#8220;Many people talk about the need for ‘closure’. It’s always felt a strange term</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of outcome, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">Madeleine</a> will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is true though that uncertainty creates weakness; knowledge and certainty give strength, and for this reason our need for answers, for the truth, is essential.”</p>

<p>Heart doctor Gerry, 53, and hospital medical worker Kate, 54, from Rothley, Leicestershire, also raised three nations&#8217; police forces for their continued work in trying to crack the painstaking case.</p>



<p>Three-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18338001/christian-b-will-stand-trial-over-madeleine-mccanns-disappearance/">Maddie</a> vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May 2007 while her parents were dining with pals nearby.</p>



<p>They cling onto a glimmer of hope she could still be alive. She would now be aged 18, nearly 19.</p>



<p>In their anniversary posting they said: &#8220;As always, we would like to thank all of our supporters for their continued good wishes and support.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a huge comfort to know that regardless of time passed, Madeleine is still in people’s hearts and minds.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their post is accompanied by a touching phrase from Winnie the Pooh author AA Milne, with a picture of Pooh bear and Piglet, saying: “But the most important thing is, even if we’re apart, I’ll always be with you.”</p>



<p>Kate and Gerry are expected to join family, friends and supporters for an informal evening service tomorrow &#8211; as a German rapist made an official suspect over Madde’s abduction faces being charged.</p>



<p>It will be the first time in four years that Kate and Gerry are together set to attend an annual outdoor prayer gathering in their village for Maddie, who they hope is “still alive.&#8221;</p>



<p>A family source said: &#8220;Kate and Gerry are expected to go to the service. It will be a time of reflection.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the past two years special prayers for Maddie at the village war memorial, where a candle still burns around the clock for her, have not been held because of the coronavirus lockdown restricting gatherings.</p>



<p>In 2019 Kate attended the public event without her husband as he was away working in Italy, but was accompanied by her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8663944/madeleine-mccann-brother-sister/">twins Sean and Amelie</a> &#8211; who are now aged 17.</p>



<h2 id="glimmer-of-hope">&#8216;GLIMMER OF HOPE&#8217;</h2>



<p>Maddie’s great uncle, retired head teacher Brian Kennedy, 83, told The Sun: “We decided just a day before the recent news about Madeleine to hold a gathering again on Cross Green.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have no more knowledge of the recent situation re the Madeleine suspect than the reports in the Press. Doubtless all will become clearer in time. We intend to have the gathering anyway.”</p>



<p>The McCanns have welcomed news that caged <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18338001/christian-b-will-stand-trial-over-madeleine-mccanns-disappearance/">Christian B has been made an “arguido&#8221;</a> &#8211; an official suspect.</p>



<p>Two years ago, the sex fiend was sensationally named by German officers as the person “responsible” for Maddie’s kidnap and presumed murder.</p>



<p>He was quizzed for the first time last week at Oldenburg jail, where he is serving a sentence for raping an American tourist &#8211; but is understood to have used his right to remain silent.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">Christian B</a>, who has been linked to four other child murders across Europe since 1996, could now be summoned to Portugal for questioning <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18433235/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-charged-months/">and even be charged.</a></p>



<p>A McCann source added: “All Kate and Gerry want is to know what happened to their daughter, and whether she is alive or dead, and for her abductor to be found and brought to justice.</p>

<p>A PENSIONER who nursing home staff thought had died turned out to be ALIVE just as his body was about to be taken to a crematorium.</p>



<p>Bizarre footage has emerged on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china">Chinese</a> social media showing the moment baffled workers unzipped a body bag after staff noticed movement as it was put in a hearse.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438882" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 625px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000730183531.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=615" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438882" width="615" height="774" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Douyin/FM10271027</figcredit></figure>Footage shows two workers pulling a body bag from a hearse[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18439024" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 258px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/d3014c9d-b5c1-4094-b045-c5c5c34b3891.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=248" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18439024" width="248" height="204" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A man who nursing home staff thought was dead was discovered alive, it&#8217;s reported</figcaption><figcredit>Douyin/FM10271027</figcredit></figure>



<p>Putuo District has launched an investigation as according to video posted locally in Shanghai &#8211; which has been subject to the world&#8217;s strictest Covid lockdown &#8211; the man was found alive after being put in a body bag.</p>



<p>The clip shows officials in protective gear hauling a yellow body bag from the hearse.</p>



<p>They can be heard telling staff to open it and one person says: &#8220;You come here and see if he&#8217;s dead? He is still breathing! Didn&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s moving?&#8221;</p>



<p>The unverified footage from May 1 then shows the body bag being peeled back &#8211; revealing the pensioner is indeed still alive despite carers thinking he&#8217;d died from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid.</a></p>

<p>A person then tells staff: &#8220;He is alive, don&#8217;t cover his face ever again.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man was then wheeled back into the nursing home before being taken to hospital for a check-up.</p>



<p>He is understood to be in a stable condition as authorities probe the incident after the nursing home issued an apology.</p>



<p>It comes after Shanghai&#8217;s 26 million residents were plunged into an extremely strict lockdown for more than five weeks with Chinese authorities justifying it as a way to get the city&#8217;s Covid cases under control.</p>

<p>She was first romantically linked with Putin a decade ago.</p>



<p>The Kremlin has denied she is his secret First Lady but rumours have persisted including claims she gave birth to at least one child.</p>



<p>One popular Russian newspaper called her the &#8220;First Lady, but in the shadows&#8221;.</p>



<p>In September 2017 she was pictured with what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4389952/vladimir-putin-rumoured-girlfriend-alina-kabaeva-wedding-ring-rumours-picture/">looked like a wedding ring during an event in Italy.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 id="the-secret-kids">THE ‘SECRET’ KIDS</h2>



<p>Putin and Kabeva are thought to have had secret children together, although there has never been any official confirmation of either their relationship or their kids.</p>



<p>Kabaeva, 38, is said to be &#8220;holed up in a very private and very secure chalet in Switzerland,&#8221; a source told&nbsp;<a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/03/06/vladimir-putin-hiding-alina-kabaeva-kids-in-switzerland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alina has two young boys and twin girls with Putin who were born in Switzerland,&#8221; the source added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The kids all have Swiss passports, and I imagine she does also.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kabaeva has been linked to the Russian leader for more than 13 years, and&nbsp;in May it was alleged that she had had two sons by him &#8211; one born in Switzerland in 2015 amid huge security and the other in 2019 in Russia.</p>



<p>Kabaeva had also&nbsp;travelled multiple times to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/switzerland/">Switzerland</a> before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438087" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000728533749.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438087" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Putin with Alina Kabaeva in 2019[/caption]



<p>As war sanctions were imposed this year, rumours suggested that she and her children were hiding out the war at a Swiss chalet retreat.</p>



<p>But in April &#8211; after a four-month absence from the limelight &#8211; she reappeared in Moscow sporting pro war attire.</p>



<h2 id="the-ex-wife">THE EX-WIFE</h2>



<p>The Russian President and former KGB officer, 69, was married to Lyudmila Shkrebneva for over 30 years, until their divorce in 2014.</p>



<p>He met the former Aeroflot flight attendant in Leningrad &#8211; now Saint Petersburg &#8211; and married her in July 1983.</p>



<p>Lyudmila is a linguist and from 1990-94 taught languages at Leningrad State University, before her husband&#8217;s political career took off in local government in St Petersburg.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> became president in 2000, Lyudmila served as the First Lady of Russia but preferred to stay out of the limelight.</p>



<p>In June 2013 the couple announced they were to separate and the end of their marriage was confirmed in April the following year.</p>



<h2 id="the-mistress-and-the-teen-queen">THE MISTRESS AND THE TEEN QUEEN</h2>



<p>Another of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13325644/putin-love-child-social-media/">Elizaveta Krivonogikh</a>&nbsp;in November 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13302399/vladimir-putin-secret-love-child-cleaner-erotic-shows/">Elizaveta was named</a>&nbsp;as Putin’s secret daughter by investigative media outlet Proekt backed by a visual computing expert at a British university.</p>



<p>Her mother Svetlana Krivonogikh, 45, is alleged to have had an affair with the strongman leader when he was head of the FSB counterintelligence service, prime minister and during his first term as Russian president.</p>



<p>The mistress is claimed to be a cleaner-turned-millionaire who owns a nightspot featuring &#8220;erotic shows”.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438081" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 646px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000650496989.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=636" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438081" width="636" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>Elizaveta Krivonogikh is said to be a &#8216;secret love child&#8217; of Putin[/caption]



<p>In April, it was reported that she and her daughter had been living in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18212856/inside-putins-daughters-gaudy-gold-plated-penthouse/">&#8220;palace&#8221; like £1.7 million home</a> in St Petersburg as it was revealed they were renting out another luxurious gold plated home in the city.</p>



<p>It came a year after Elizaveta was reportedly seen for the first time being driven by an official government car to a packed venue in the Moscow as she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14263250/vladimir-putins-secret-love-child-birthday-dj-moscow/">celebrated her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday party.</a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>She has refused to confirm findings by Bradford University visual computer expert Hassan Ugail that she shows a “phenomenal resemblance to the Russian president”.</p>



<h2 id="two-daughters">TWO DAUGHTERS</h2>



<p>Despite the split, Putin shares two daughters, Maria and Katerina, from his marriage to Lyudmila and they are his only confirmed children.</p>



<p>Maria is said to be an endocrinologist and has a career in medical research.</p>



<p>She is believed to be married to a Dutch businessman, Jorrit Faassen, with whom she has a family, making Putin a grandfather.</p>



<p>Katerina, 33, meanwhile, has gone from being a high-kicking &#8220;rock’n’roll&#8221; dancer to spearheading a major new Russian artificial intelligence initiative.</p>



<p>She was formerly married to Russia’s youngest billionaire, Kirill Shamalov, 38, though is now divorced.</p>



<p>She gained a doctorate from Moscow State University after completing a study on helping cosmonauts and pilots to orientate themselves in difficult conditions.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18438072" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000552624294.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438072" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin&#8217;s daughter Maria Putina</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>In June 2020, unseen pictures of the two as daughters as teenagers hemerged from the private collection of an estranged friend.</p>



<p>They were released as part of a $15milllion legal case brought against the Russian state by former Putin confident Sergei Pugachev, 57.</p>



<p>Speaking of his daughters in 2015 Putin said: &#8220;My daughters live in Russia and studied only in Russia, I am proud of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They speak three foreign languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Every person has a right for their fate, they live their own life and do it with dignity,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>German cops previously said the convicted <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">sex offender</a>, 45, who was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17388796/seven-pieces-evidence-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b/">declared an “arguido”</a> by Portuguese police, has not <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383657/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-alibi-german-cops/">provided them with an alibi</a>. </p>



<p>The rapist who has told a US documentary he was elsewhere when the tot was snatched <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/">in Algarve in 2007</a>, has now claimed he was with having sex with a German woman in his camper van that night, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-claims-he-has-an-alibi-which-can-be-backed-by-woman-12604001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky </a>reports.</p>



<p>He said the pair were even stopped and photographed at a police roadblock, as he drove her to the airport in Faro, the next day.</p>



<p>He also claimed the woman was arrested at airport security for carrying an illegal pepper spray and later appeared in court. </p>

<p>He reckons Portuguese police must have a record of the incident which will prove his relationship with the German woman, who was on holiday with her parents.</p>



<p>German cops reportedly found a photo of the woman lying in the suspect&#8217;s van during the investigation into the rape of a US pensioner, in Portugal in  2005, for which Christian B is currently serving a seven-year jail sentence. </p>



<p>While at first he reportedly could not remember the woman&#8217;s full name, it is understood he had been able to identify her. </p>



<p>If confirmed, the alibi would contradict evidence from mobile phone data that put him 200 yards from Kate and Gerry’s Ocean Club apartment on the day Madeleine was taken.</p>

<p>German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, told Sky News: &#8220;I assume if he has anything that exonerates him that sooner or later he will share it with us and we would then check it out. What happens then, let&#8217;s see.</p>



<p>&#8220;So far he has told us nothing, he&#8217;s given us no alibi. So, we can only work on the evidence we have found so far in our investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;And there was nothing to exonerate him.&#8221;</p>



<p>After two years of complete silence, Christina B has claimed he<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/"> can prove where he was </a>at the time Maddie got abducted.</p>



<p>The details will be revealed tomorrow, on the 15th anniversary of the young Brit&#8217;s disappearance,  in the documentary Madeleine McCann: <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18335904/suspect-charged-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-germany/">Prime Suspect</a>, by US network AMC Crime.</p>



<p>Despite investigators&#8217; suspicions of his links to the unsolved case, he has never been charged.</p>



<p>It has previously been claimed that the suspect has a<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17433138/madeleine-mccann-suspect-alibi/"> “number of people”</a> willing to provide an alibi.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters said: “We actually haven&#8217;t found a single piece of the puzzle in the two years that would have somehow helped to exonerate Christian B. </p>



<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s really nothing that would somehow maybe be an alibi or something. Nothing of that has come to light, really at any point.&#8221;</p>

<p>A MAN has sued his friends who cut him out after they won £600,000 on the lottery.</p>



<p>Philip Tsotsos from Windsor, Ontario, Canada has been left out of the massive prize that was won by the group of sixteen pals last summer.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18436623" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/b13140e0-6daa-4790-9fd7-8f86dd9a2111.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18436623" width="960" height="771" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Philip Tsotsos has sued his friends over the winnings</figcaption><figcredit>Facebook/ Philip Tsotsos</figcredit></figure>

<p>The group of sixteen pals won the Maxmillion prize on a Lotto Max ticket from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) last year <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/lottery-group-left-out-1.6433692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBC</a> reported.</p>



<p>They claim that Tsotsos is not entitled to a part of the prize as he had not paid the amount required to stay in the lottery pool.</p>



<p>But now &#8220;hurt&#8221; pizza delivery worker Tsotsos has taken the matter to the civil court as he claims he should be declared the 17th winner.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Their dreams came true. Why should they steal mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>He is suing the group of friends for £40,000 and other costs, including interest.</p>



<p>Tsotsos added he discovered the group had won on social media.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t they tell me they won? These guys are like family to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The group&#8217;s defence lawyer David Robins said: &#8220;Mr Tsotsos did not pay to play, so we deny that he is entitled to any of the relief that he is seeking, and we&#8217;ll be vigorously defending the claim.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this instance, he did not play and he was not included.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Mr Tsotsos insists he didn&#8217;t always pay for the tickets right away as the pool operated on a credit system.</p>



<p>He said he always ensured to pay his debts in the past and he&#8217;s never been cut off in the six years he&#8217;s taken part in the pool.</p>



<p>Tsotsos had reportedly a tab of £18 at the time of the draw, when the group&#8217;s organiser Steven Todesco messaged him he would have to repay the amount plus another £6 to remain in the group.</p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=15807&#038;game=polling"></script>



<p>Tsotsos reportedly replied he would pay the amount (£25) that Friday  and then said &#8220;just take it out of our winnings when we win.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response, the organiser joked he would charge him a high-interest rate.</p>



<p>According to reports Tsotsos received another reminder from a different member of the group to make sure he would pay the £6 to stay in to which he agreed that he would.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ok, just wanted it in writing before the draw lol,&#8221; was the purported response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tsotsos said the day he found out about the win he had just brought the group a free pizza.</p>



<p>He said &#8220;the same guy that&#8217;s eating my pizza is holding a million-dollar cheque,&nbsp;and that&#8217;s how I found out,&#8221; which &#8220;hurt more than anything&#8221;.</p>

<p>He added that the winning ticket fetched approximately £49,700 divided 16 ways and it would have been just £3,500 less if he had been included.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;It&#8217;s c****y what they&#8217;re doing to me. I don&#8217;t wish them anything bad. I wish them nothing but success in life, but why ruin my dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>TWO hero Brits have been told they could face the death penalty by a Russian prosecutor after they were captured and paraded on TV.</p>



<p>The prosecutor of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic smirked as he told a TV crew that Brit fighter Shaun Pinner, 48, and&nbsp;28-year-old Aiden&nbsp;Aslin could be executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrei Spivak said the men &#8211; who were caught <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">trying to defend Mariupol</a> in mid-April &#8211; were being charged with &#8220;crimes against civilians of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The maximum punishment for these crimes is the death penalty,&#8221; the prosecutor said.</p>



<p>Aiden was heard saying he understood the accusations against him but fiercely denied killing civilians.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s highly unlikely the charges could have been brought without the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Kremlin</a>&#8216;s approval.</p>

<p>Spivak said the men were charged with &#8220;acting deliberately as part of the armed forces of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, being on the territory of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic in a time of war&#8221;.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also accused of trying to &#8220;forcibly seize and retain power&#8221; over the Kremlin-backed breakaway region.</p>



<p>The prosecutor also listed charged including the &#8220;acting deliberately as part of the armed forces of Ukraine, being on the territory of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic in a time of war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aslin is seen saying to the camera: &#8220;I understand fully what I am accused off and I agree with it fully up to the part about murdering civilians. I don&#8217;t agree with [that].</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with the fact that I fought on the territory of the [DPR], and fought against soldiers in peaceful settlements.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">Pinner appeared drained</a> as he acknowledged&nbsp;that the charges.</p>



<p>Both men were captured when their battalions were forced to surrender last month to Russia forces in Mariupol.</p>



<p>Aiden and Shaun &#8211; who fought with Ukraine&#8217;s 36th Marines &#8211; have lived in Ukraine for some time and are fully-paid members of its military.</p>



<p>Aiden joined the Marines in 2018 while Shaun moved to Mariupol four years ago to be with his second wife Larysa when he joined the Ukrainian Army as a &#8220;contract soldier&#8221;.</p>



<p>It comes amid Russian claims the men were &#8220;mercenaries&#8221;.</p>



<p>Under the Geneva Convention fighters can be classed as mercenaries if they are motivated by “private gain”.</p>



<p>And they must be paid &#8220;substantially in excess&#8221; of local soldiers – which both were not.</p>



<p>Legal experts said the convention is crystal clear the men should be treated as combatants with all the protections of a PoW.</p>



<p>Neither of the men were seen openly pleading guilty and its not clear if they were informed about the death penalty.</p>



<p>Russia outlawed capital punishment in 1996 but could reintroduce it.</p>



<p>In February, prime minister Dmitry Medvedev promised to bring it back.</p>



<p>It comes as Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18416439/andrew-hill-brit-fighter-paraded-russian-tv-wounded/">paraded another hero Brit fighter</a> on national TV.</p>



<p>Andrew Hill, a dad of four from Plymouth, appeared wounded with a head bandage and his left arm in a sling after being captured in Mykolaiv.</p>



<p>Hill looked tired and terrified and kept his head bowed as he looked at the floor, occasionally glancing up nervously as he asked if he would ever get back to England.</p>



<p>And it comes days after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">Scott Sibley became the first Briton to be killed in the conflict</a>.</p>

<p>Heels admitted at Melbourne&#8217;s Magistrates Court that he committed a series of offences alongside his boyfriend Tristan Cullinan-Smayle.</p>



<p>Heels pleaded guilty to a string of offences on Friday including engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, intentionally sexually touching a child and producing child abuse material, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10774037/Benjamin-Heels-Tristan-Cullinan-Smayle-plead-guilty-child-sex-offences.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>

<p>The case was first reported by the <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=HSWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Fleader%2Fsouth-east%2Fpakenham-music-director-ben-heels-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-child%2Fnews-story%2F0fb7bd971d971a1ec87ace88d78699f7&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;v21=dynamic-cold-control-score&amp;V21spcbehaviour=append" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Herald-Sun.</a> </p>

<p>Heels was arrested last May in Berwick, Melbourne after he was caught with child abuse material on an electronic device. </p>



<p>The court heard that the former music teacher who worked at the Fountain Gate Secondary College, produced the material between January and May last year, just days before his arrest.</p>



<p>It comes as a strange Facebook post has emerged where Heels expresses his worry over children singing songs about sex.</p>



<p>The bizarre post reads: &#8220;Please be aware of what your child is singing about.</p>

<p>RUSSIAN state TV has threatened to drown the UK under a radioactive tsunami in a bizarre new propaganda video.</p>



<p>In the chilling broadcast the presenter also showed how the Kremlin&#8217;s latest world-ending Satan 2 nuclear missile could also annihilate Britain.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18435606" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dmitry-Kiselyov-threatening-UK-2-east2west-news.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18435606" width="960" height="537" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russia has threatened more devastating nuclear strikes on Britain</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<figure id="attachment_18435609" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sarmat-ballistic-missile-launch-4-east2west-news.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18435609" width="960" height="621" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The devastating new Russian intercontinental ballistic missile ‘Sarmat’</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The warning comes as the Kremlin raised the prospect of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">devastating military strikes on Britain</a> over its deal to supply weapons to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine.</a></p>



<p>Pro-<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a> TV pundits previously threated the use of the world ending <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18358256/putin-boasts-satan-2-nuclear-missile-break-through-defences/">RS-28 Sarmat missile</a> – gleefully spouting its ability to wipe England from the map.</p>



<p>And now raising further plans for all-out war, brazen host Dmitry Kiselyov heralded Russia’s second option to “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea&#8221; with its “underwater robotic drone Poseidon”.</p>



<p>In a chilling graphic he warned the missile would raise a giant tsunami wave up to 1,640ft high.</p>

<p>He later predicted the surging water &#8211; reaching almost halfway up Scafell Pike in the English Lake District &#8211; would contain “high doses of radiation” turning what is left of Britain into a “radioactive desert”.</p>



<p>His double whammy threat was based on the “baseless”&nbsp; premise perpetrated by the Russian state media and officials in the past week&nbsp; that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> had threatened to carry out a nuclear strike on Russia without consulting <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">NATO.</a></p>



<p>Downing Street last week dismissed this as “another example of disinformation peddled by the Kremlin&#8221;, but it continues to be trumpeted  in Moscow.</p>



<p>The invective from Russian state TV appears to get more extreme as Putin’s war in Ukraine becomes more mired with rising losses of troops and armaments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a verbal attack, Kiselyov said Britain &#8211; which has angered Moscow with its steady supplies of weaponry to Kyiv &#8211;  was no match for Russia.</p>



<p>He asked: “And what will happen after Boris Johnson&#8217;s words about a ‘retaliatory strike on Russia’?”</p>



<p>Accusing Britain of “rambling”, he said: “Why do they threaten vast Russia with nuclear weapons while they are only a small island?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The island is so small that one Sarmat missile is enough to drown it once and for all…</p>



<p>“Russian missile Sarmat [aka Satan-2], the world most powerful…is capable of … destroying an area the size of Texas or England.</p>



<p>“A single launch, Boris, and there is no England anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin himself last week darkly warned of using nuclear weapons against the UK and its European allies as devastating nuke maps were broadcast across Russian TV.</p>



<p>It gleefully warned Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>



<p>The Sarmat hypersonic 208-ton ’Satan-2’&nbsp;intercontinental ballistic missile has a speed of 15,880mph and is claimed by the Kremlin leader to be “unstoppable”.</p>



<p>Russia <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18319208/putin-test-fires-nuclear-missile-russia-satan/">successfully launched the missile </a>earlier this month with Putin warning the test was &#8220;food for thought for those who try to threaten <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&#8220;.</p>



<p>A video showed the killer missile being launched from an underground silo, triggering an enormous fireball.</p>



<p>It travelled almost the entire length of Russia &#8211; almost 3,600 miles &#8211; in around 15 minutes and landed at Kura Missile Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>



<p>The bombs are 1,000 times more powerful than those dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during World War Two.</p>



<p>It comes as Russia&#8217;s foreign minister warned a nuclear world war is now a &#8220;real&#8221; danger as British and NATO weapons are already &#8220;legitimate&#8221; targets in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Sergei Lavrov said the risk of World War 3 is now &#8220;considerable&#8221; &#8211; saying the West is essentially fighting a proxy war against Moscow via its support for Kyiv.</p>



<p>Lavrov accused Nato forces of &#8220;pouring oil on the fire&#8221; by &#8220;pumping weapons into&nbsp;Ukraine&#8221;.</p>



<p>In an interview with Russian news agencies, he said: &#8220;This is our key position on which we base everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;The risks now are considerable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lavrov accused the West of deliberately attempting to &#8220;wear down the Russian army&#8221; and exhaust their ability to make war &#8211; something the minister bullishly said was an &#8220;illusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he claimed&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18372327/donald-trump-nuclear-war-piers-morgan-interview-talk-tv/">prevent a nuclear war</a>&nbsp;at all costs.</p>

<p>It comes as it was revealed that Putin may have to hand power to his shadowy spy chief amid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18402141/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-paranoia-traitors-insane/">rumours of poor health.</a></p>



<p>It has been reported the Russian leader, 69, could go under the knife with power switched to hardliner Nikolai Patrushev, 70, who is a key architect of the war strategy and the man who convinced Putin that Kyiv was awash with neo-Nazis.</p>

<p>A WOMAN has managed to save £63k to buy a house by living on just £5 a month &#8211; here&#8217;s how she did it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-korea/">South Korean</a> youngster Ji-hyeon Kwak shot to fame after sharing her extreme saving hacks on TV.</p>

<p>Ji-hyeon, 24, got her first job at 19 and put aside £63k over four years to finally bag herself a spot on an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/">apartment</a> waiting list.</p>



<p>The thrifty young&#8217;un <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/">pulls in £1,255 (2m won) a month</a>, which is near the minimum wage, and spends as little as £5 (8,400 won) a month on groceries.</p>



<p>Ji-hyeon says she eats a varied diet and uses an elaborate system of coupons and discount cards to make ends meet.</p>



<p>In a recent appearance on South Korea&#8217;s Master of Living programme, the 24-year-old revealed she uses several apps to collect points and coupon codes that she then spends of a variety of products.</p>

<p>She also walks two hours a day to save money on transport, only drinks tap water and homemade tea and eats whatever she can for extremely cheap or wins via her apps.</p>



<p>If she happens to win bottled water, she&#8217;ll sell it online and save the money.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so surprised that I won the first challenge. I wondered if it was a dream or real life.&#8221;</p>

<p>DRAMATIC footage shows the moment a bomb from a Ukrainian drone flies through the sunroof of a Russian vehicle sending soldiers running for their lives.</p>



<p>In the clip, the bomb can be seen in the air, plummeting towards the target and falling directly into the vehicle. </p>

<p>It then explodes, sending smoke up the sky as terrified Russian troops are fleeing the scene.</p>



<p>It is unclear where the attack took place.</p>



<p>The video was shared on Twitter by government advisor Anton Gerashchenko who said the hit was executed by soldiers from Ukraine&#8217;s 92nd brigade.</p>



<p>Last week <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">another drone strike</a> from what was believed to be Ukraine&#8217;s 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion, destroyed two Russian tanks.</p>

<p>Striking footage showed the devastation caused by the strike as the hit sparked a massive inferno.</p>



<p>Throughout the war, Ukrainian fighters have been using <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17957095/ukraine-russia-turkey-drone-bayraktar-tb2/">relatively cheap drones</a> to cause havoc with Russia.</p>



<p>Videos shared online show Ukraine&#8217;s popular weapon the Bayraktar TB2 destroying Russian missile launchers on the ground.</p>



<p>It is a small Turkish-made unmanned vehicle that has become something of a favourite, despite being quite basic compared to other tech.</p>

<p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are thought to cost about $5million (£3.8million), far cheaper than Israel&#8217;s Heron at $10million (£7.6m), and US drones for about $20million (£15.3m).</p>



<p>Apart from their low cost, they are also smaller and slower but as it turns out quite successful.</p>



<p>Ukraine is known for using relatively simple equipment to fight Putin&#8217;s army since the beginning of the invasion. </p>



<p>Back in March, a squad of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18087524/amateur-drone-users-destroyed-russian-convoy/">amateur drone</a> users claimed they managed to destroy Russia&#8217;s 40-mile <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17914958/russian-troops-kyiv-attack-ukraine-war/">infamous &#8220;death convoy&#8221;</a> of tanks and armoured vehicles in a series of ambushes.</p>



<p>Volunteer experts from specialist air reconnaissance unit Aerorozvidka used drones with thermal image cameras or those capable of dropping small bombs as well as sniper rifles to attack Russian troops.</p>

<p>The group&#8217;s commander Lt Col Yaroslav Honchar said an ambush near the town of Ivankiv helped to halt the massive Russian operation during the first days of the Ukraine invasion.</p>



<p>The special IT force used quad bikes to approach the column at night, and attacked its supply depot to prevent the Russians from advancing.</p>

<p>A PAIR of high school students returned home from a graduation party and were never seen again &#8211; with an answering machine message providing one of the only clues. </p>



<p>Suzanne Streeter and Stacy McCall, 19 and 18, vanished alongside Streeter&#8217;s mum Sherrill Levitt, 47, from their home in Springfield, Missouri, in the US, almost exactly 30 years ago. </p>

<p>Cops remains baffled by the case as decades on no concrete evidence has ever been found to establish what happened to the three women.</p>



<p>The enduring mystery has become known as &#8220;The Springfield Three&#8221; &#8211; and remains unsolved despite more than 5,000 tips to detectives. </p>



<p>And perhaps the biggest mysteries of the case are a &#8220;strange&#8221; answering machine message and a string of &#8220;obscene&#8221; phone calls made to the house the morning of the disappearance. </p>



<p>It also became apparent Suzanne was interested in devil worship and satanism &#8211; and even dated a boy who had been arrested as part of a grave robbing gang. </p>

<p>But amid these enduring mysteries, cops have found no threads, hair, blood, or DNA to give detectives a solid lead in the case.  </p>



<p>Suzanne and Stacy had both graduated Kickapoo High School on June 6, 1992 &#8211; and were last seen at around 2am when they headed back after a party to the Streeter&#8217;s house in East Delmar Street. </p>



<p>The pals were due to go on a trip to a water park their friend&nbsp;Janelle Kirby the following day &#8211; but they never showed up. </p>



<p>Sometime between 2am and 7.30am on June 7 &#8211; they vanished along with Sherrill. </p>



<p>The pals had actually been due to stay with Janelle, but decided the house was too crowded so headed back to Stacy&#8217;s to spend the night.</p>

<p>Janelle, her boyfriend Mike and Stacy&#8217;s mum Janis went to house after the duo failed to show up the next morning. </p>



<p>But when they arrived &#8211; they had little idea they were stumbling into a crime scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;You say &#8216;I love you&#8217; again on the phone and I had no idea that was the last time I was going to hear her voice,&#8221; Janis told <a href="https://truecrimedaily.com/2017/10/17/crime-watch-daily-investigates-the-mysterious-disappearance-of-the-springfield-three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">True Crime Daily</a> in 2017. </p>



<p>With no sign of Suzanne, Stacy, or Stacy&#8217;s mum Sherrill, they explored the house &#8211; and chillingly there was a ringing from the phone.</p>



<p>Janelle answered the phone &#8211; and one the other end was a man&#8217;s voice who made a series of vile &#8220;sexual innuendos&#8221;. </p>



<p>She then hung up, but the phone rung again &#8211; and it was another &#8220;strange and disturbing&#8221; sexual prank call. </p>



<p>Janis described the calls as &#8220;lewd sexual content&#8221; and &#8220;very rude&#8221;. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18379780" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 772px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728797869.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=762" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18379780" width="762" height="557" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The house where the three women vanished from appeared normal and barely disturbed on the morning of June 7</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<figure id="attachment_18379841" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 373px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ce92415c-e738-492f-af9d-616751d8fc57.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=363" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18379841" width="363" height="368" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">One of the few clues at the property was a smashed outside light &#8211; but the bulb remained intact</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>It was obvious something was very wrong &#8211; with the women nowhere to be seen and all three of their cars were still on the drive. </p>



<p>And later that day there was another strange and obscene message left on the house&#8217;s answering machine.</p>



<p>But it was automatically deleted by the device after it had been listened to &#8211; potentially destroying evidence. </p>



<p>Cops believe this answering machine message may have contained a vital clue to the disappearance of The Springfield Three.</p>



<p>As they explored the house, the strangeness of the scene became apparent to them. </p>



<p>The glass lamp shade on the porch was shattered, and the family dog Cinnamon was locked outside and appeared agitated.  </p>



<p>Money, clothing, keys, cigarettes and other personal items were all left behind and there did not appear to be any obvious signs of a struggle.</p>



<p>All three women&#8217;s purses were lined up and neatly sitting on the floor of the living room &#8211; including Sherrill&#8217;s which was holding $900.</p>



<p>The girl&#8217;s graduation gowns were found in Suzanne&#8217;s bedroom with the TV left on. </p>



<p>They had taken off their make-up and left their jewellery by the sink.</p>



<p>No other clothes appeared missing, so it seems the women vanished in whatever bed clothes they were wearing overnight. </p>



<p>With no clues as to what happened to the trio, Janis called the police and reported them missing as night began to fall. </p>



<p>Sixteen hours after the women were last seen &#8211; detectives arrived and found the crime scene had already been contaminated by up to 20 people as worried friends and family assisted with the search.</p>



<p>The worried pals had unwittingly destroyed potential evidence &#8211; including sweeping up the shattered porch light.</p>



<p>Cops tried to recover the strange answering machine message, but had no luck &#8211; saying there was &#8220;nothing they could do&#8221;.</p>



<p>And with that one of the most important potential leads was lost.</p>



<p>Captain Tony Glenn told News-Leader: &#8220;The only thing unusual about this house was that three women were missing from it.</p>



<p>&#8220;You had this feeling as you looked around that something was missing, that something had to be missing. </p>



<p>&#8220;But there wasn&#8217;t. Just them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Detectives began to research the background of the missing people, and found that Suzanne had unusual interests &#8211; having several books about satanism.</p>



<p>It was revealed she had dated a local &#8220;bad boy&#8221; who had been arrested for breaking into graves and stealing gold teeth from skulls. </p>



<p>But he was quickly tracked down and there was nothing found to link him into the case.</p>



<p>Cops received a lead two weeks later when a member of public spotted a woman driving a van just two miles away from the house.</p>



<p>It was said the woman looked like Suzanne. </p>



<p>The caller said she looked scared and a man was heard threatening her from the back seat of the green panel van.</p>



<p>But despite this potential breakthrough, it ended up coming to nothing as the frustrated police were left at a dead end. </p>



<p>Other leads are pursued &#8211; including reports of a drifter with long hair and a full beard spotted lurking near the house.</p>



<p>With the FBI involved, the women&#8217;s disappearance investigated as potentially the work of a serial killer. </p>



<p>And another tipster claims they saw the three women at George&#8217;s Steakhouse between 1am and 3am on the night they disappeared.</p>



<p>The vanishing was featured on America&#8217;s Most Wanted &#8211; and featured one key caller who claimed to have inside information about the disappearences.</p>



<p>But the anonymous tip line meant cops could never get in touch with him.</p>



<p>And despite appeals by the police for the man to come forward again, he never did and his mystery remains unknown.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18379811" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 264px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dd73cdc3-b99c-410b-bf9c-ddb2d6f4aba3.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=254" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18379811" width="254" height="356" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Robert Craig Cox is one of the few named suspects in the case &#8211; but he has never been charged</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Cops zeroed in some of their inquiries on for US Army veteran Robert Craig Cox &#8211; who had previously been on death row before the case against him was dropped.</p>



<p>He worked at the same car dealership as Stacy&#8217;s dad. </p>



<p>Cox has made a string of contradictory statements about the case, including once claiming he knew the women were dead and where they were buried.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that they&#8217;re dead, I&#8217;ll say that. I know that,&#8221; he told local TV reporter Dennis Graves.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, but I just know that they&#8217;re dead. That&#8217;s not my theory, I just know that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cox then told Graves he wouldn&#8217;t say anything else until his mum passes. </p>



<p>His parents however have given him an alibi on the night of their disappearance, even though his girlfriend revealed she lied for him over a separate alibi for the morning of June 7.  </p>



<p>He was imprisoned for kidnap and robbery in Texas, and was sentenced to death over the murder of Sharon Zellers in Orlando, Florida.</p>



<p>Cox spent nine years on death row &#8211; but the Florida Supreme Court later overruled the conviction of the former US Army ranger due to a lack of evidence.</p>



<p>Cops remain unsure over his links to the case &#8211; with some suspected he was merely stringing police along by suggesting he had information about the Springfield Three. </p>



<p>The case remains open &#8211; and one of the leading theories remains that the women were buried beneath the parking lot of Cox Hospital.</p>



<p>At the time the area was under construction and was an empty dirt lot before being paved over and used to erect the garage.</p>



<p>Ground penetrating radar was used during an investigation in 2007 &#8211; and three anomalies in the shape of graves were found.</p>



<p>However, local officials refuse to dig up the area citing cost and damage to the structure.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have also questioned the authenticity of the tip that lead to the find, saying it came from someone who claimed to be &#8220;psychic&#8221;. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>VLADIMIR Putin is likely to be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s and early stage Dementia while his paranoia and fear over traitors is driving him insane, a former KGB agent has said. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian tyrant&#8217;s</a> health has long been the source of speculation, with Western intelligence suggesting he has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/">serious health issues</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18403071" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/d7c96e46-00e5-416a-a45a-fdfba74f96aa-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18403071" width="960" height="648" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Putin at Orthodox Easter mass at the Christ The Saviour Cathedral in Moscow</figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>



<p>Despite Putin&#8217;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov insisting Putin&#8217;s health is &#8220;excellent&#8221;, his recent public appearances following the shambolic <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine invasion</a> have sparked rumours about his physical state.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17420978/former-russian-spy-uk-death-threats/">ex-Russian spy Boris Karpichkov</a>, 62, said even members of Putin&#8217;s inner circle would not be told about the state of his health in order to protect his &#8220;strongman&#8221; image.</p>



<p>The Russian defector, who now lives in the UK, said paranoid Putin views everyone as a &#8220;traitor&#8221; &#8211; and his health was an &#8220;especially sensitive issue&#8221; .</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17425280/ex-kgb-spy-tortured-hellhole-russian-jail/">former double agent</a> told The Sun Online: &#8220;He is &#8211; or at least acts &#8211; insane and obsessed by paranoia ideas. </p>

<p>&#8220;He sees literally everyone, including those inside the Russian security services and even inside his close inner circle, to be &#8216;traitors&#8217;. </p>



<p>&#8220;He is so suspicious and so obsessed with his paranoia ideas that he can be now compared with Stalin tyrant.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Karpichkov said it is likely Mad Vlad is suffering from &#8220;numerous&#8221; health conditions, such as the early stages of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17806903/does-vladimir-putin-have-parkinsons-disease/">Dementia and Parkinson&#8217;s. </a></p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I am not a medic myself&#8230; but there is a serious concern that Putin is suffering from numerous physical health conditions &#8211; possibly from the sport injuries during his younger years.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is along with some issues which affect older people &#8211; such as Dementia in the early stages. </p>

<p>&#8220;But he is well known in his inner circle as a person who &#8216;does not forget anything&#8217; and who recalls details of many people he met.</p>



<p>&#8220;Another potential issue might be &#8211; judging from how he moves &#8211; that Putin can is suffering from the initial stages of either Parkinson&#8217;s, or another serious disorder caused by some form of cancer, brain tumour, for example.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="http://thesun.co.uk/topic/kremlin">Kremlin</a> officials have always denied there is anything wrong with their leader, who turns 70 in October.</p>



<p>But Putin appeared <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18397441/putin-health-fears-struggling-breathe-speech/">confused and out of breath as he wheezed</a> his way through his latest speech, threatening the West with nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>The president&nbsp;seemed to struggle to catch his breath and paused several times during the address to politicians, stumbling over his words and looking exhausted.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18397441/putin-health-fears-struggling-breathe-speech/#"></a><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18390888/how-kremlin-tightly-controls-putin-hide-ill-health/#"></a></p>



<p>And last week, during talks with his defence minister Sergey Shoigu, the elderly tyrant was filmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping the table and slouching</a>, sparking further rumours he may be suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Professor Erik&nbsp;Bucy, a body language expert from Texas Tech University, told The Sun Online upon watching the video: &#8220;It’s an astonishingly weakened Putin compared to the man we observed even a few years ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;An able-bodied president would not need to keep himself propped up with a hand held out for leverage and would not be concerned about keeping both feet planted on the ground.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/">Russian leader&#8217;s hands trembled violently</a>&nbsp;in a video clip showing him greeting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belarus/">Belarusian</a>&nbsp;President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15064105/who-belarus-president-alexander-lukashenko/">Alexander Lukashenko</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Kremlin.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18379438/vladimir-putin-shakey-hands-parkinsons-health-rumours/#"></a></p>

<p>The footage showed a frail-looking&nbsp;Putin&nbsp;holding his hand out to greet Lukashenko before retracting and walking around the room.</p>



<p>His knees then buckle as he walks to embrace his Belarusian counterpart in the undated footage.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the latest video calling the monster&#8217;s health into question after recent footage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18356517/vladimir-putin-parkinsons-health-rumours-easter/">showed Putin&nbsp;biting his lips and fidgeting</a>&nbsp;distractedly at a church service on Sunday further stoked claims the autocrat has a terminal illness.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, a video seemed to show&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383848/putin-limping-meeting-un-chief/">him limp and grimace</a>&nbsp;as he walked during talks in Moscow with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>



<p>And in a separate video, a dishevelled Putin was seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18333382/putin-parkinsons-rumours-seen-gripping-table/">gripping a table and tapping his foot</a>&nbsp;in video that&nbsp;Kremlin&nbsp;watchers claimed showed a drastic decline in his physical state.</p>



<p>Experts have also pointed out that he looks &#8220;bloated&#8221; and &#8220;weakened&#8221; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18133008/chilling-new-clues-putin-thyroid-cancer-parkinsons/">has even seen a doctor who specialises in Thyroid cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Putin has long prided himself on his &#8220;strongman&#8221; image but his dramatic change over the past few years has prompted speculation that he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17981023/vladimir-putin-body-language-disease-symptoms/">may be suffering from a severe physical illness</a>.</p>



<p>The despot seems to be always surrounded by security, following a detailed programme and only attending a small number of meetings- for a short time.</p>

<p>A BRIT dad is facing the death penalty in Iraq after being accused of attempting to smuggle broken pottery.</p>



<p>Retired geologist Jim Fitton, 66, is set to miss his daughter&#8217;s wedding after being detained in the country for five weeks in what his desperate family have branded a &#8220;living nightmare&#8221;.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18432138" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729245705.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18432138" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>PA</figcredit></figure>Brit Jim Fitton, pictured with wife Sarijah, is facing the death penalty in Iraq[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18432145" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729492613.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18432145" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>SWNS</figcredit></figure>The dad-of-two, 66, with daughter Leila, son Joshua and Sarijah[/caption]



<p>The dad-of-two collected stones and shards of broken pottery as souvenirs while visiting a site in Eridu, in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iraq">Iraq</a>&#8216;s south-east, as part of an organised geology and archaeology tour.</p>



<p>But the items were judged to be artefacts under Iraqi law and the charge levelled at Mr Fitton states &#8220;whoever exported or intended to export, deliberately, an antiquity, from Iraq, shall be punishable with execution&#8221;.</p>



<p>His daughter Leila and her husband Sam Tasker, from Bath, in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/somerset/">Somerset</a>, say the sentencing this month is expected to coincide with a long-planned celebration of their wedding.</p>



<p>They said: &#8220;There is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it&#8217;s been turned into an absolute living nightmare.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have accepted the fact that, without timely intervention from the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), Jim will be unable to attend this ceremony too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Fitton has been detained in Iraq for five weeks after being accused of attempting to smuggle historic artefacts out of the country.</p>



<p>His case in connection with the March incident is expected to go for sentencing in the week beginning May 8.</p>



<p>Ministers have come under increasing pressure to help free Mr Fitton as he faces the death penalty.</p>

<p>A petition urging for his release set by his son Joshua and daughter has received more than 97,000 signatures in the three days since it was launched.</p>



<p>Mr Fitton&#8217;s family described the response to the petition as &#8220;unbelievable&#8221;, adding in a statement: &#8220;Jim really appreciates the support from old colleagues, good friends, kindred spirits, and complete strangers who have not allowed this to go unnoticed.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will continue to fight while we continue to have you at our backs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Fitton worked as a geologist for oil and gas companies during his career and lives in his adopted home of Malaysia with his wife, Sarijah.</p>



<p>Wera Hobhouse, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, has raised his case with ministers in the House of Commons.</p>



<p>The family said their lawyer has drafted a proposal under Iraqi law to have the case closed before trial but they need the Foreign Office to &#8220;put their weight behind the plan and endorse it&#8221; so they can secure a high-level meeting with judicial officials in the country.</p>



<h2 id="life-in-the-balance">&#8216;LIFE IN THE BALANCE&#8217;</h2>



<p>The proposal cites the &#8220;clear lack of criminality, that Jim is a victim of poor guidance and circumstance, and also cites the huge investment that the UK has made in the Iraqi governmental and judicial framework through FCDO funding in the past few years&#8221;.</p>



<p>The family statement, via an update on the petition website, also explained: &#8220;Leila has not seen Jim for more than two years due to Covid travel restrictions.</p>



<p>&#8220;We held a small Covid wedding ceremony in Bath in August of last year for close friends and our British family members, mostly on my side.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have, since then, been planning a larger celebration in Malaysia with all of Leila&#8217;s extended family. This is scheduled on May 8.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ms Hobhouse said: &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to imagine what Jim and his family are going through, especially as Sam and Leila are planning their wedding.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are pressing the Foreign Office to intervene but sadly they are continuing to refuse. I cannot understand why the Foreign Office is not intervening when Jim&#8217;s life lays in the balance.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Foreign Office must do everything in their power to bring Jim back home to his family.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Foreign Office has said it is providing consular support and is in contact with the local authorities.</p>

<p>Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Ms Hobhouse, said last week: &#8220;We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton&#8217;s case and the UK&#8217;s opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes after Brit footballer <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16391714/footballer-jailed-dubai-cbd-oil/">Billy Hood</a> was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16459109/brit-footballer-jailed-cbd-bid-freedom/">jailed in Dubai</a> after he was found guilty of possession, selling and drug trafficking after police found&nbsp;just four small bottles of vape oil in his car.</p>

Wade determined the future of abortions in the United States[/caption]</p>
<h2>What is Roe v Wade?</h2>
<p>The 1973 ruling of Roe v. Wade asserted the 14th amendment and declared access to safe and legal <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/3782462/uk-abortion-laws-nhs-termination-alabma-illegal/">abortion</a> as a constitutional right.</p>
<p>The case was heard to decide if <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/texas/">Texas</a>&#8216; ban on abortions, which were completely outlawed except when a woman&#8217;s life was in danger, was constitutional.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court voted 7-2 in favor of the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>It said women had a right to privacy, which meant it was up to them to decide whether to continue their pregnancy.</p>
<p>It also divided pregnancy into three trimesters, declaring that the first three months are solely at the discretion of the woman.</p>
<p>In the second trimester, the states can regulate abortions in the interests of the woman&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>In the last three months, states can prohibit abortions in the interest of the fetus, provided the pregnancy will not bring harm to the pregnant woman.</p>

<p>Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in the case after the decision had been made.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also voting in support of Roe was Justices Burger, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall and Powell.</p>
<p>After the decision 46 states needed to change their abortion laws to comply with the ruling.</p>
<p>Abortion has proved to be one of the most divisive moral issues in recent years, with &#8216;pro-life&#8217; groups comparing the procedure to murder.</p>
<p>On the flip side, &#8216;pro-choice&#8217; groups argue that abortion should be safe and legal for anyone who needs one.</p>
<p>The number of abortions performed each year has been falling.</p>
<p>For women ages 15 to 44, the abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) dropped 26 percent between 2006 and 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>In 2006, US medical professionals reported performing 842,855 abortions but by 2015, that number dropped to 638,169.</p>
<h2>Is Roe v Wade being overturned?</h2>
<p>On May 2, 2022, an initial draft majority opinion written by <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/5250627/who-is-samuel-alito/">Justice Samuel Alito</a> was obtained by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico</a> and revealed a rejection of <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/2904633/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-abortion-ruling/">the landmark 1973 decision</a> which guaranteed constitutional protection of abortion rights.</p>
<p>The draft revealed that the Supreme Court has &#8220;voted to strike down the Roe v Wade decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,” Alito wrote in the document obtained by Politico.</p>
<p>“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitution provision…”</p>
<p>He also mentioned the 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v Casey, which upheld Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>The justice wrote that <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/5250597/supreme-court-overturn-abortion-decision-draft/">the document</a> is the &#8220;opinion of the court&#8221; and added that “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representative.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_14984614" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 228px"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14984614 size-medium" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000653968898.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=218" alt="" width="218" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure> Many have since tried to overturn the ruling[/caption]</p>
<p>Alito added &#8220;We emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What law did Texas pass about abortions in 2021?</h2>
<p>Just months before Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3580055/what-is-the-texas-abortion-law/">Texas passed a law banning abortion</a> from as early as six weeks.</p>
<p>It bans abortions after the detection of the &#8220;fetal heartbeat,&#8221; which some medical authorities have deemed misleading.</p>
<p>The law took effect after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency appeal by abortion providers.</p>
<p>It gives any individual the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point.</p>
<p>The law, known as the Heartbeat Act, was signed into effect by <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1056378/greg-abbott-texas-governor-wheelchair/">Texas governor Greg Abbott</a> in May 2021.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), then requested that the Supreme Court block the legislation.</p>
<p>On September 1, the ACLU confirmed that the court had &#8220;not responded to our request&#8221;, adding: &#8220;Access to almost all abortion has just been cut off for millions of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has described the law as &#8220;blatantly unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texan women who wish to have an abortion after six weeks will need to travel across state lines to find a physician or clinic that can perform the procedure.</p>
<p>Americans may be able to seek up to $10,000 in damages in a civil court against abortion providers as well as anyone who &#8220;aids and abets&#8221; an illegal abortion.</p>
<p>In theory, this could mean clinic staff and family members could all be targeted for a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The ACLU has said that the law will encourage &#8220;a bounty hunting scheme&#8221; of costly &#8220;vigilante lawsuits&#8221; designed to harass women seeking an abortion.</p>

<p>AS Vladimir Putin&#8217;s troops poured into Ukraine, the so-called Ghost of Kyiv became a symbol of resistance and was quickly hailed a hero amid claims the ace had downed dozens of enemy planes.</p>



<p>And so Ukrainians were gutted when it was claimed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18415688/legendary-ghost-kyiv-fighter-pilot-killed-battle/">brave fighter had been killed in combat</a> after macho propaganda of the masked pilot shooting down <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> jets saw his popularity soar.</p>

<p>The Ghost of Kyiv had been named last week as 29-year-old Stepan Tarabalka &#8211; who died in battle on March 13.</p>



<p>He  was posthumously awarded Ukraine’s top medal for bravery in combat, the Order of the Golden Star, with the title Hero of Ukraine.</p>



<p>But the Ukraine Air Force Command has now said Tarabalka was NOT the Ghost of Kyiv as the truth of the morale-boosting pilot is not so clear cut.</p>



<p>It warned the ace is a merely a &#8220;character&#8221; rather than an actual person.</p>

<p>A Facebook post said: &#8220;Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!&#8221;.</p>



<p>The messaged urged people to &#8220;check the sources of information, before spreading it&#8221;.</p>



<p>It stressed that &#8220;Tarabalka is not &#8216;Ghost of Kiev&#8217;, and he did not hit 40 planes&#8221;.</p>



<p>The post described the flying ace as &#8220;a collective image of pilots of the Air Force&#8217;s 40th tactical aviation brigade, who defend the sky over the capital&#8221; &#8211; rather just one pilot&#8217;s record.</p>

<p>Back in March, the Ukrainian military shared a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18415688/legendary-ghost-kyiv-fighter-pilot-killed-battle/">snap showing a person wearing an oxygen mask in the cockpit </a>of an MiG-29 fighter jet, with the caption “Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!”.</p>



<p>And he Ukrainian government’s official account posted a 38-second clip on their social media back on February 27, writing: “People call him the Ghost of Kyiv.</p>



<p>&#8220;And rightly so – this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircrafts.”</p>



<p>Footage purported to show the MiG-29 jet soaring through the air before destroying six Kremlin planes on the first day Putin launched his war.</p>



<p>But one of the videos was debunked by experts as being from the 2008 videogame Digital Combat Simulator &#8211; fuelling suspicions the ace had been made up as officials tried to rally support for their resistance against the Russian invasion.</p>



<p>The footage starts with a cartoon mock-up of the plane, before going into the debunked footage of a destroyed Russian jet.</p>



<p>Text then appears on the video, which states: “Ukraine probably got its first ace since World War II. This is the anonymous pilot of the MiG-29, nicknamed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17796004/who-ghost-of-kyiv-real/">Ghost of Kyiv.</a></p>

<p>And they claim to have evidence proving beyond doubt that she was murdered soon after.</p>



<p>Sources suggested forensic work was ongoing to trace “potentially crucial” evidence from a VW van he drove at the time.</p>



<p>But the suspect — serving seven years in a German jail for raping an OAP in Portugal — denies involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</p>



<p>Yet he has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18383657/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-alibi-german-cops/">not provided an alibi to police</a>, according to cops.</p>



<p>The convicted paedophile has told a US documentary he was elsewhere when the Brit when the tot was snatched.</p>



<p>Mr Wolters told The Sun: “We’re not aware of any alibi at all.”</p>



<p>The frustrated investigators believe the prime suspect is “playing games with them”.</p>



<p>After stonewalling German interrogators,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11778199/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-investigation/">Christian B</a> has instead chosen to give details of his alleged alibi to a US TV documentary.</p>



<p>Prosecutors will remain none the wiser until&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18345751/madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-b-interview-on-disappearance/">Madeleine McCann: Prime Suspect</a>&nbsp;is aired on Tuesday — the 15th anniversary of the three-year-old Brit’s abduction.</p>

<p>AROUND 100 civilians escaped the Azovstal “Alamo” yesterday in an evacuation from blitzed port city Mariupol.</p>



<p>A local ceasefire allowed them to flee the sprawling steel plant where diehard bands of Ukrainian soldiers have made a desperate last stand against the Russian invaders.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> confirmed the mercy mission had started after weeks of crushing false starts.</p>



<p>The UN and Red Cross-backed rescue raised hopes for thousands of others trapped in tunnels and bunkers in the last part of the ruined city still in Ukrainian hands.</p>



<p>Mr Zelensky said: “The evacuation of civilians from Azovstal began.</p>



<p>“The first group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area. Tomorrow we will meet them in Zaporizhzhia.”</p>

<p>But hundreds of wounded soldiers are rotting with gangrene — still underground and without access to painkillers.</p>



<p>The breakthrough came as details emerged of a ninth Russian general killed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>.</p>



<p>Major-General Andrei Simonov, 55, an electronics warfare expert, reportedly died in a command post blitzed by Ukrainian rockets.</p>



<p>The Kremlin’s top commander, General Valery Gerasimov, was also reportedly hurt in the same devastating strike in Izyum, in Kharkiv province.</p>

<p>Kyiv’s former interior minister Arsen Avakov said Gerasimov suffered a flesh wound yesterday, with sources suggesting his “legs and hips are damaged”.</p>



<p>It was also said that three of his entourage had been killed.</p>



<p>As Chief of the Russian General Staff, Gerasimov had been sent by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> to take personal control of the tyrant’s push to grab territory in eastern Ukraine.</p>



<p>Footage shared on social media appears to show the strike from a rocket salvo.</p>



<p>The attack also reportedly destroyed more than 30 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks.</p>



<p>An unofficial Russian source reported Gerasimov suffered “a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture”.</p>



<p>If true, his wounding is another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign. Gerasimov had swooped into occupied Izyum — now a major staging post — to take charge of the battle for the eastern Donbas region.</p>



<p>The dreaded second-wave onslaught looks to have failed to achieve its objectives of conquering Donetsk and Luhansk in time for Putin’s May 9 Victory Day parade.</p>



<p>After suffering a “sharp injury” in the bombardment, Gerasimov was later spotted at Belgorod, 20 miles inside Russia, where he landed on a helicopter and left on a military plane. A witness said he walked onboard the plane unaided.</p>



<p>If it is confirmed the command post was hit as Gerasimov visited, it would be a major coup for western intelligence partners, as well as Ukraine’s armed forces.</p>



<p>Western sources briefed Ukraine on almost every detail of Putin’s invasion and gaps were revealed by Russian soldiers who discussed key objectives on open telephone lines.</p>



<p>Ukraine continued to hit Russian soil yesterday with a strike on an ammunition dump. Thick plumes of smoke were spotted over the base in Belgorod.</p>



<p>Russia said that it had hit back with missile strikes on a disused airport in Odesa.</p>



<p>Moscow said it launched “high precision Onyx missiles” at a hangar full of “weapons and ammunition delivered from the United States and European countries”.</p>



<p>Russia also claimed to have hit two S-300 air defence systems, which are key to intercepting missiles and planes.</p>



<p>Earlier, strikes on Russian soil were confirmed with satellite photos which showed devastated fuel depots in the city of Bryansk.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the UK’s ambassador to Ukraine says she feels “comfortable” returning to Kyiv despite Russian threats against diplomats in the Ukrainian capital.</p>



<p>Melinda Simmons arrived on Friday, following the announcement last month that Britain would be reopening its embassy in the city in a show of support for Ukraine’s fight against the invasion.</p>

<p>Her return comes after Moscow threatened a “proportional response” against the UK for backing Ukrainian strikes behind Russian lines, hinting at possible strikes at British sites in Kyiv.</p>



<p>PM Boris Johnson had said staff would begin returning thanks to Ukraine repelling Moscow’s troops from around the city.</p>

<p>HERO Ukrainians are using tiny Mad Max style buggies to obliterate monster Russian tanks &#8211; and even take down planes.</p>



<p>Mounted with Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile systems on their roofs, the nippy two-seater vehicles are wreaking havoc for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>&#8216;s forces as they are wielded by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine">Ukrainian</a> defenders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> troops have suffered severe losses since the war began in February with Ukraine claiming it has killed more than 23,000 of Moscow&#8217;s soldiers.</p>



<p>The wrecks of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war">Putin’s war</a> machines also litter the land he ordered his forces to invade as Ukraine also claims it has destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>The brave defenders have been using inexpensive battle buggies amid their display of defiance that has stunned the world.</p>



<p>In a David versus Goliath style battle, Ukrainian hit and run raid teams have been fielding the Ranger UTVs against some of Russia&#8217;s most terrifying and lethal armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Armed with a Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile systems (ATGMs) on their roofs, the all-terrain vehicles have proved no match for Russia&#8217;s arsenal as they can strike ground vehicles as well as low-flying aircraft.</p>



<p>Developed by the Kyiv design bureau Luch, they typically fire 130-millimetre calibre missiles and can be operated by remote control from a distance of up to 50 metres.</p>



<p>Ukraine has assembled a formidable anti-tank force with large numbers of missiles from the UK, US, Germany and others adding to its own arsenal.</p>



<p>Luch&#8217;s description of the missile says they are &#8220;designed to destroy manpower and stationary and mobile modern armoured targets with combined, carried or monolithic armour including ERA (explosive reactive armour) and also pinpoint targets like weapon emplacements, lightly armoured objects and hovered helicopters at any time of day or night&#8221;.</p>

<p>Pictures shared on social media show the two-seater buggies in all their glory, painted in camouflage colours.</p>



<p>The formidable missile was caught on camera destroying a Russian tank.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18047162/russian-tank-obliterated-ukrainian-missile/">Drone footage showed the Russian tank exploding</a> into a fireball the moment it was ambushed on a road.</p>



<p>Flames poured into a line of trees on one side as burning pieces of debris were hurled in the direction of a nearby factory on the other and soon the tank was engulfed in thick smoke.</p>



<p>Putin&nbsp;expect a quick victory when he ordered the invasion of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&nbsp;</a>but fierce resistance has seen a mounting death toll, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18032566/putin-loses-fifth-colonel-in-ukraine-invasion-russia/">several generals and senior officers&nbsp;</a>among the dead.</p>



<p>Ukrainian fighters have&nbsp;put up<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">&nbsp;strong resistance</a>&nbsp;after weeks of fighting which has led to humiliating losses for Moscow.</p>

<p>AN OUTRAGED employee has shared how their boss has asked to check their phone battery level every day to make sure they are working during company time.</p>



<p>The worker explained that their manager was convinced the company&#8217;s low performance was due to the time employees spent on their phones. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18430932" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 933px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729939338.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=923" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430932" width="923" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>The boss asked to see screenshots of his employee&#8217;s phones&#8217; battery levels[/caption]



<p>The frustrated employee said their boss who manages a company in Wuhan, China made the bizarre request that all his staff would send him screenshots of their phone battery usage before leaving work. </p>



<p>The worker added that a group of employees who were unhappy with the situation brought up the issue with the supervisor.</p>



<p>He noted however that most of them did not want to take the matter further fearing they would lose their jobs.</p>



<p>The employee has divided opinions after they posted the invasive tactic on Weibo as users branded it &#8220;useless&#8221; while others advised staff to quit and find a job with a better working environment.</p>

<p>Someone said: &#8220;It’s outrageous, when a company starts doing stuff like this, it usually means it’s going downhill and you can start planning to change jobs.&#8221; </p>



<p>Another one said: &#8220;A clear invasion of privacy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other users suggested bringing in a second phone and sending the screenshots from it.</p>

<p>And a boss<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18382809/boss-divides-opinion-with-offensive-sign-reddit/"> has divided opinion</a> by putting up a sign telling employees that &#8220;work is not meant to be fun&#8221; alongside a minion character.</p>

<p>DRAMATIC footage shared online appears to show a Russian soldier being blown up during a live stream.</p>



<p>The young soldier can be seen filming himself walking through a warzone as he apparently bragged about killing Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The unverified clip that was shared by Ukraine&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, shows the man talking to the camera.</p>



<p>He appears to be saying: &#8220;The main task is done with an A+ mark. We have a total of three wounded.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moments later a massive explosion knocks him to the ground.</p>



<p>It is currently unknown whether the soldier survived the blast.</p>

<p>It comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428145/putins-top-military-commander-wounded-ukraine/">Russia&#8217;s top military commander</a> was reportedly sent back to Russia after he was wounded- just days after he arrived to take charge of the war.</p>



<p>The Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov had been sent by Putin to take personal control of his push to grab territory in Donbas and eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian forces have suffered severe losses during Vladimir Putin&#8217;s bloody war with Ukraine claiming it has killed over 23,000 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion.</p>



<p>Ukraine also claims it has destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>

<p>Earlier today <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">another top commander</a> was killed as Putin lost his ninth general since he started the war on February 24.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Simonov&nbsp;head of the 2nd Combined Arms Army was reportedly killed near the city of Izyum in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">Striking footage</a> that emerged yesterday showed the moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike, believed to be from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>



<p>Ukrainian fighters have&nbsp;put up<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/"> strong resistance</a>&nbsp;after weeks of fighting which has led to humiliating losses for Moscow.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s failed invasion has so far seen <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">dozens of Russian commanders </a>killed as well as the sinking of flagship Moskva<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/"> in the Black Sea after being hit by Ukrainian Neptune missiles</a>.</p>



<p>Russian troops have been forced out of Kyiv and have now focused on Ukraine&#8217;s eastern Donbas region where fighting continues.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">officials have warned</a> that the Russian leader&#8217;s army chiefs have urged him to launch an all-out war on Ukraine as &#8220;payback&#8221;.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin&#8217;s top military commander has been wounded in Ukraine and was sent back to Russia just days after he arrived to take charge of the war.</p>



<p>The Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov had been sent by Putin to take personal control of his push to grab territory in Donbas and eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18430531" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729925568.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430531" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Gerasimov was reportedly wounded in Izyum[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18430656" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 699px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729893171-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=689" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18430656" width="689" height="520" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Major General Andrei Simonov was reportedly killed in an attack in Izyum</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The unconfirmed claim is that Gerasimov, 66,&nbsp; was wounded in Izyum in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, which is at the centre of intense fighting.</p>



<p>It is also where Russia’s ninth general Major General Andrei Simonov, 55, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18428303/ninth-russian-general-killed-ukrainian-attack/">was killed</a>, according to reports today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footage shared on social media appears to show the strike from a rocket salvo.</p>



<p>The attack also reportedly destroyed over 30 Russian armoured vehicles, including tanks.</p>

<p>And now an unofficial Russian source reported that Gerasimov who had just arrived at the region on Thursday sustained “a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture. </p>



<p>“The shard was removed &#8211; there is no danger to life.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian government official Anton Gerashchenko said the attack on Izyum was “the very place where…Gerasimov, who personally came to lead the attack on Slavyansk, was located”.</p>



<p>A “large number” of senior officers were killed, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro-Ukr Telegram channel Vertikal said Gerasimov had been “wounded near Izyum”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our source reports that his legs and hips are damaged.”</p>



<p>It suggested that three of his entourage had been killed and the chief of the general staff was evacuated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agentstvo media outlet reported that he was flown out of the war zone initially by an Mi-8 military helicopter to Belgorod in western Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Separately, a military site in Belgorod region was seen on fire in videos, caused by a suspected Ukrainian attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three Ka-52 attack helicopters circled as the Mi-8 transported him and other top brass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then in Belgorod, he boarded a Defence Ministry Tu-154 plane which flew to an unknown destination.</p>



<p>Founder of independent Conflict Intelligence Team Ruslan Leviev said an eyewitness at the airport had seen Gerasimov board the plane unaided.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The source confirms that it was Gerasimov who flew away,” he posted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But he went on board himself, alive and well.&#8221;</p>

<p>If true, his wounding even if minor by the Ukrainians is another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin has two sons with his secret gymnast lover, the doctor who delivered the boys has reportedly confirmed.</p>



<p>The 69-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Russian tyrant </a>has long rumoured to be in a relationship with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/">Alina Kabaeva</a>, 38, but fresh details have now emerged about their two sons.</p>

<p>Alina is said to live the life of a First Lady of Russia, with a fleet of limousines at her disposal and a squad of machine gun-toting security guards for her protection.</p>



<p>But while Putin acknowledges his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/18206061/putins-daughters-slapped-with-sanctions/">two daughters</a> from his marriage to Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, which ended in 2013, he has kept his relationship with Kabaeva, as well as any other children, under wraps.</p>



<p>Now the Swiss newspaper Sonntagszeitung has revealed he has two sons by her, with one born in Switzerland in 2015 amid huge security and the other in 2019 in Russia.</p>



<p>The fresh detail contradicts rumours that Putin and the Olympic gold medal winner had twins in 2018.</p>

<p>The paper says its source is a personal friend of Kabaeva who also knows the doctor who delivered the two boys and confirmed the details about their birth.</p>



<p>The Russian-born female medic works at Clinica Sant’Anna in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of Switzerland where the first child was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same doctor delivered the second son in Moscow in 2019, says the paper and before the birth, Kabaeva had travelled in secret to Lugano several times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source described Kabaeva as “a very pleasant woman adding “she is a real sportswoman, very straight, without posturing”.</p>

<p>Kabaeva had also&nbsp;travelled multiple times to Switzerland before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently rumours suggested that she and her children were hiding out the war at a Swiss chalet retreat.</p>



<p>But ten days ago &#8211; after a four-month absence from the limelight &#8211; she reappeared in Moscow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She defied sanctions to wear a £2,000 dress as she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18363180/putins-mistress-dress-z-symbol-parade-after-hiding/">hosted a Z-symbol parade</a> in support of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The new revelations come as it emerged Putin is set to<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18422816/putin-undergo-cancer-operation/"> undergo an operation for cancer</a> and hand power to his spy chief.</p>



<p>Kabaeva is retired rhythmic gymnast once dubbed &#8220;Russia&#8217;s most flexible woman&#8221;.</p>



<p>She won Bronze at the 2000 Olympics in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sydney/">Sydney</a> and went on to win Gold at the 2004 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/10504587/greek-capital-athens-isnt-just-about-famous-ruins-it-makes-a-great-city-break/">Athens</a> Games.</p>



<p>Putin was pictured giving her a medal in 2001 before she was stripped of six of her world championship medals for doping.</p>



<p>After retiring, Kabaeva began her career in politics and was a Member of the Russian Parliament between 2007 and 2014, representing the United Russia party.</p>



<p>She posed semi-nude for a men&#8217;s magazine in 2004.</p>



<p>Putin announced his divorce from Ocheretnaya in 2013, and a spokesman denied he was having an affair, claiming he was too busy.</p>



<p>In 2016, Kabaeva appeared in public&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1883377/vladimir-putins-lover-spotted-in-public-wearing-wedding-ring/">wearing a ring on her ring finger</a>, which she seemed to attempt to hide from the cameras.</p>



<p>Another of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13325644/putin-love-child-social-media/">Elizaveta Krivonogikh</a>&nbsp;in November 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13302399/vladimir-putin-secret-love-child-cleaner-erotic-shows/">Elizaveta was named</a>&nbsp;as Putin’s secret daughter by investigative media outlet Proekt backed by a visual computing expert at a British university.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin has lost his ninth general while fighting in Ukraine following an attack on a military base.</p>

<p>Last month Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284616/eighth-russian-general-killed-ukraine-blow-putins-failed-invasion/">was laid to rest</a> with full military honours in St Petersburg.</p>



<p>Previously Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18000210/putin-loses-fifth-general-blow-invasion-ukraine/">was killed in battle</a>&nbsp;at Chornobaivka, near the southern city of Kherson.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Kolesnikov of the 29th Combined Arms Army and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17877568/russian-general-killed-ukraine-vladimir-putin/">Vitaly Gerasimov</a>, died in fighting.</p>



<p>Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky&nbsp;was reportedly<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17837254/russian-general-dead-ukraine-sniper/">&nbsp;shot dead by a sniper</a> at the battle for Hostomel Airfield about 30 miles outside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17795690/kyiv-kiev-ukraine-spelling-pronunciation/">capital Kyiv</a>&nbsp;in early March.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17781459/missile-strikes-third-night-fighting-2/">General Magomed Tushaev&nbsp;</a>died when his Chechen special forces column, including 56 tanks, was obliterated near Hostomel, north-east of the city.</p>



<p>Major-General Oleg Mityaev, 47, died in Mariupol as well as Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev who also died in fighting.</p>



<p>Since the beginning of the invasion on February 24, Russia has lost over 21,000 but Moscow has failed to give accurate figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>&nbsp;claims it has killed more than 23,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">dramatic footage</a> showed the moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike, believed to be from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>

<p>A DISTURBING tale of forbidden love between two incestual siblings shocked the world when they vowed to stay together for their children. </p>



<p>Susan Karolewski was reunited with her older brother Patrick Stuebing 20 years after he escaped their abusive home when he was adopted aged three, in the former East <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/">Germany.</a> </p>

<figure id="attachment_18428164" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 832px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sibling_Love_2jpg-JS729037056.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=822" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18428164" width="822" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The pair had four children together, two suffering from severe disabilities</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>But just six months after their biological mother died, the pair, then 16 and 23, described how their fondest for each other turned into a disturbing sexual relationship. </p>



<p>The couple went on to have four children, two of which are severely disabled, with Patrick serving two jail terms after being found guilty of incest. </p>



<p>The pair sparked a media storm when the relationship came to light in 2001 and vowed to challenge Germany&#8217;s incest laws that made sex between siblings illegal. </p>



<p>In 2012 Patrick appealed to the Court of Human Rights in a bid to seal their shocking union by claiming he and Susan had a right to family life. </p>

<p>Speaking at the time, Patrick: &#8220;We do not feel guilty about what has happened between us. </p>



<p>&#8220;We want the law which makes incest a crime to be abolished.&#8221;  </p>



<p>Patrick was born into a struggling family in 1977 in Leipzig and was one of eight children. </p>



<p>At the age of three, he was fostered after being attacked with a knife by his alcoholic father. </p>

<p>He was adopted by his foster parents aged 7 nearly 100 miles away in the city of Portsdam. </p>



<p>His sister, Susan, was born in 1984 on the day their parent&#8217;s divorce was finalised. </p>



<p>Susan, who is mentally disabled, grew up in the same abusive household her brother had been able to escape and was poorly educated, barely able to read and write. </p>



<p>Some of the six brothers and sisters died after being born with disabilities, while another was run over aged 7. </p>



<h2 id="forbidden-lovers">FORBIDDEN LOVERS </h2>



<p>The pair eventually met in 2000 when Patrick sought out his biological family but their relationship intensified just six months after their mother, Ana Marie, died of a heart attack. </p>



<p>Susan became heavily dependent on her brother and was described by a reporter as being an obsessive nail-biter with a simple way of speaking. </p>



<p>Susan was just 16 when she and Patrick, then 23, first began their disturbing incestual relationships when the siblings started sharing a room. </p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-439288/Forbidden-love-brother-sister.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mail in 2007,</a> he said: &#8220;We both stayed up late into the night to talk to each other about our hopes and dreams. </p>



<p>Susan said: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know each other in childhood, it&#8217;s not the same for us. </p>



<p>&#8220;We fell in love as adults and our love is real. There is nothing we could do about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were both attracted to each other and nature took over from us.   It was that simple. What else could we do? </p>



<p>&#8220;We followed our instinct and our hearts.&#8221; </p>



<p>By October 2001, Susan fell pregnant with her first child and gave birth to a baby boy with severe disabilities, named Erik.  </p>



<p>But a nurse became suspicious and contacted German cops before Patrick received a year&#8217;s suspended jail term for incest and Susan, 17 and still treated as a juvenile, was placed in care. </p>



<p>The pair continued to meet in secret and Susan had three more children, keeping her bump covered with baggy clothes. </p>



<p>A daughter Sarah, who was also born disabled, as well as Nancy and Sophia. </p>



<p>Patrick was jailed for ten months for his second incest conviction and then for a further two and a half years after being convicted for the third time. </p>



<p>The pair denied that their children were born disabled due to their incestuous relationship. </p>



<p>Speaking in 2007, Patrick said: &#8220;Two of our children are disabled but that is not necessarily anything to do with the fact that we are siblings. </p>



<p>&#8220;There are disabled people in our family. We had six brothers and sisters who did not survive in some cases because they were disabled.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="court-appeal">COURT APPEAL </h2>



<p>While Patrick was behind bars Susan told reporters that she could not live without him &#8211; despite conceiving a fifth child with another man.</p>



<p>The mum-of-five however gave up her rights to the child before the baby went to live with its father. </p>



<p>Patrick underwent a vasectomy in 2004 and attempted to change the German law that made incest illegal in a bid to keep himself out of prison. </p>



<p>But in 2008 The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany upheld the law and rejected his appeal. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18393351" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729036649.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18393351" width="640" height="360" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The pair have four children together with two currently in foster care</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>In 2012 Patrick also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that the couple had a right to family life and privacy. </p>



<p>Again the appeal was rejected after the court believed the couple had been treated fairly by German authorities. </p>



<p>The couple often visited son Erik at his foster home and sensationally claimed that had their first child not been taken away, they would not have had any more children. </p>



<p>Patrick said: &#8220;When you see your child being looked after by someone else when they should be with you, that&#8217;s hard for any parent to bear. </p>



<p>&#8220;So if he is handicapped, well, that is all the more reason we should be able to look after him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Talking of his vasectomy he said: &#8220;There is no reason for them to jail me now. I do not want to go back to jail and I know we will never voluntarily leave each other. </p>



<p>&#8220;If anyone doubts our love they should just see we will not be kept apart.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2014 the German Ethics Council made a shocking u-turn and voted in favour of allowing incest between siblings. </p>



<p>They claimed the risk of disability was not enough to warrant the law after reviewing the German couple&#8217;s case. </p>



<p>The law still remains in Germany with incestual relationships between siblings being illegal. </p>

<p>HEARTLESS Michael Jackson would let his guards bludgeon bunnies to death before chucking them to his alligators in front of terrified kids, the star&#8217;s maid has revealed. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-jackson/">King of Pop</a> also allowed his child pals to hurl huge rocks at his terrified lion Kimber, let his elephants be chained by their legs in tiny enclosures – and even encouraged visitors to pet his giraffes even though the animals had previously attacked an adult and a youngster, she said.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18416097" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729060866-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18416097" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>JDMC</figcredit></figure>Jackson&#8217;s former maid Adrian McManus has spoken out about animal cruelty she witnessed at Neverland[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_18416126" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2202e6ee-18eb-406d-a47a-0fbfac700c8f.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18416126" width="960" height="626" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The star had a huge collection of exotic animals</figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>



<p>Adrian McManus, 60, who used to be one of Jacko&#8217;s personal maids said it still breaks her heart to think about how the singer&#8217;s animals were treated at his Neverland zoo.</p>



<p>It comes after The Sun revealed how Jackson delighted in watching his kids run riot, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18393607/michael-jackson-neverland-chimps-attacked-kids-molested-maids/">attacking kids and staff.</a></p>



<p>In one sickening incident, McManus said she witnessed guards grab a live bunny, smash its heads on some rocks, then throw it to Jackson’s collection of alligators.</p>



<p>“Michael had a pool built with a secure fence where he housed around four or five alligators,” she said.</p>

<p>“They were huge creatures, about six feet long. The only people ever allowed in were the handlers, but Michael liked to look over the fence to see them being fed.</p>



<p>“During one lunch break I was down there with some of the maids, just looking at the animals. One of Michael’s bodyguards, not an animal handler, just walked into the gated area, carrying a big white rabbit.</p>

<p>“I ran away from that fence immediately and jumped on a golf cart and headed back to the main house. It took me days to get over it. </p>



<p>“Those guys carried guns, frightened many of us and we were afraid of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>McManus, who was the star&#8217;s maid from 1990-1994, said it soon became a regular occurrence and that the twisted ritual would sometimes be carried out in front of Jackson&#8217;s terrified child pals. </p>



<p>“This became quite common with different staff doing similar killings,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2 id="cruel-and-inhumane">&#8216;CRUEL AND INHUMANE&#8217;</h2>



<p>“And it got to a point where Michael heard about this new ritual, probably because some of the kids and maids were upset.</p>



<p>“I was told Michael told the guards: ‘Don’t be doing that when the kids come around’. But it was too late because some of the children had already seen them do that.</p>



<p>“It was not a warning to not behave so despicably, but simply an order to not upset the kids.</p>



<p>“A member of the security team told me that some of the bodyguards were doing the same with rabbits and rats to feed the snakes.</p>



<p>“The treatment was cruel and inhumane.”</p>



<p>McManus also recalls how the elephants, giraffes and lion were<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8590560/michael-jackson-neverland-ranch-rig-paedo-abuse-rooms/"> badly treated too. </a></p>



<h2 id="lion-stoned-by-kids">&#8216;LION STONED BY KIDS&#8217;</h2>



<p>MJ even let his child pals through huge rocks at his terrified lion Kimber.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the most horrible things I saw was how the lion was treated,&#8221; McManus recalls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael would be with the kids, walking them around the enclosures.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the little boys would pick up rocks, the size of tennis balls, and throw them at the cage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many of them were too big to get through the bars, but it rattled them and upset the creature greatly.</p>



<p>&#8220;They were trying to make the lion Kimber roar. But he was more scared and cowered to the back, fearing more attacks.</p>



<p>&#8220;It meant the lion seemed nervous and on edge. Certainly staff were very wary about going near the lion.</p>



<h2 id="animals-drugged">&#8216;ANIMALS DRUGGED&#8217; </h2>



<p>&#8220;Michael saw all this unfold often and never said anything to the kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>When inspectors came, the poor lion was drugged and taken away because Jackson didn&#8217;t have the right permits, McManus alleges.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they knew a visit from The Occupational Safety and Health Administration was coming, they drugged him up and took him away,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Jacko also encouraged kids and visitors to pet giraffes even after they cut a man&#8217;s head open and left a child crying in pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day I went into work and there was chaos in the animal&nbsp;enclosures, because a guest had been hurt by a giraffe,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2 id="giraffe-attacks">&#8216;GIRAFFE ATTACKS&#8217; </h2>



<p>&#8220;I was told the giraffe simply swung his long neck around and its head smashed into a guest&#8217;s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It left him in excruciating pain and had cut open part of his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s injuries were so deep and significant that he needed stitches to repair the damage.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we never learned what happened to him and anyone asking questions would be told to stop. It was all hushed up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Another occasion a giraffe was meeting kids at a family day Michael had laid on&#8230;&nbsp;but one child was knocked to the floor because the creature thought it was some treats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw the kid&#8217;s head struck by the curious giraffe, which sent him falling really hard on the tough turf. He was holding his head and crying in pain.</p>



<h2 id="elephants-in-chains">&#8216;ELEPHANTS IN CHAINS&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;Nothing was done and guests seemed to just brush it off because it was Michael&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>&#8220;That incident never stopped guests being told it was okay to pet or interact with the giraffes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was heartbreaking because those creatures had no idea of how to deal with people, but were treated like circus animals.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heartbreakingly she also saw elephants, chained up by the legs and cruel bullhooks in tiny enclosures </p>



<p>&#8220;I saw elephants in the habitat which seemed very small areas for animals that size. They were close together and had very little room to exercise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time I saw them there their legs were chained up. I saw guys who worked there holding these long metal bars with round hooks, which I believe were bull hooks. </p>

<p>&#8220;The elephants never looked happy and I felt terrible for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>A BRIT martial arts boxer is weathering the fight of his life after smashing his skull and limbs in a horror <strong>motorbike</strong> crash in Thailand.</p>



<p>Christian Richardson, from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/york">York</a>, had recently won his first Muay Thai contest when he was struck down by a lorry on April 13.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18427609" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 617px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729780970.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=607" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18427609" width="607" height="351" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>York Press/Chris Richardson</figcredit></figure>Brit Christian Richardson was hit by a lorry in Thailand[/caption]

<p>The 32-year-old escaped with his life but had several shattered bones and is in hospital after undergoing a number of operations.</p>



<p>He is too ill to fly home to the UK, and his desperate family are trying to raise £60,000 for his treatment.</p>



<p>Sister Emmy Watson says her younger brother &#8220;miraculously didn&#8217;t die or have any brain or spinal injuries&#8221;.</p>



<p>Chris was leaving a coffee shop in <a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/thailand">Thailand</a> when he was hit by a pickup truck, and suffered &#8220;many injuries and broken bones&#8221;.</p>

<p>He was treated at a hospital in Koh Samui for three days before being airlifted to Bangkok.</p>



<p>His heartbroken family say he is unable to transfer to a hospital in the UK as he is battling an infection and needs facial and eye surgery to repair a broken cheekbone and a bad orbital floor fracture.</p>



<p>Emmy says they are on tenterhooks waiting to find out whether his insurance company will fork out for his medical bills &#8211; which she says is &#8220;unlikely&#8221;.</p>



<p>She has started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/chris-motorbike-accident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> to help pay for his surgery &#8211; with the first two days of treatment costing an eye-watering £25,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;The insurance company has been assessing the case, although we think it unlikely that they will pay, a decision has not been made yet and as a result our family has had to pay out significant sums of money,&#8221; Emmy wrote on the page.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many thanks in advance to anyone who is able to help in any way they can. </p>



<p>&#8220;We need to support our fighter get through this as I know we all want to see him get back to training and having a laugh with us over a pint of Guinness.&#8221;</p>



<p>So far, well-wishers have donated more than £25,000.</p>



<p>Emmy says that if the insurance company covers the costs, all donations will be refunded.</p>



<p>It comes after a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18404049/video-british-tourist-boxer-knife-thief-thailand/">Brit tourist </a>in Thailand was left covered in blood after fighting a knife-wielding boxer who allegedly stole his bag on a beach.</p>



<p>Fraser William Cowen, 23, was paddling in the sea with friends when he saw the thug run off with his belongings in Krabi, southern&nbsp;Thailand, last Sunday.</p>



<p>He sprinted after Suwit Puengsom &#8211; a former professional Muay Thai boxer &#8211; as he was trying to make a getaway on a motorcycle.</p>

<p>THIS is the hilarious moment a sea lion brazenly took a dip in a hotel pool before pinching a bemused guest&#8217;s sunbed as gobsmacked tourists watched on.</p>



<p>Cheeky Wendy and her pup Lulu are regular guests at the exclusive resort in the Galapagos Islands and are known at the hotel for their antics.</p>

<p>Comical footage captured by a holidaymaker shows the cute creature hauling herself up some steps from the sea to the facility&#8217;s outdoor area.</p>



<p>Wendy then invaded the hotel&#8217;s pool &#8211; diving in head first without a second thought.</p>



<p>But after a speedy cruise through the water, the sassy sea lion then sprung out of the water and made a beeline for the only sun lounger sat on by a guest.</p>



<p>The amusing clip shows the confused tourist quickly jumping to his feet as Wendy barges him out the way and nabs his seat.</p>

<p>He can be seen grabbing his towel off the sunbed in a hurry before throwing his arm in the air in confusion as Wendy makes herself comfortable.</p>



<p>Tourists at the hotel are warned about Wendy and are asked to try to stay at least six feet away from the sun lounger stealer.</p>



<p>Guests are also warned to avoid attempting to stroke or feed Wendy and her pup &#8211; who often spend hours sprawled out in the sun on the hotel&#8217;s recliners.</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s a good reason holidaymakers are told to keep their distance, as the slippery sea creatures have a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18314652/worlds-worst-sea-lion-attacks-maul-bite-savage/">troublesome track record of attacking humans</a></p>

<p>The mammals&#8217; dangerous reputation is often overshadowed by more formidable beasts lurking in the ocean and their inclusion in circuses and shows &#8211; meaning they are easily underestimated.</p>



<p>Their curious nature is often mistaken as friendliness by swimmers, with many forgetting their animal instincts will always reign supreme.</p>



<p>Humans are playing an underwater game of Russian roulette by taking a dip into their environment &#8211; no matter how many cute cartoons you may have seen.</p>



<p>Although attacks are rare, coming within 8ft of the beasts can have disastrous consequences.</p>



<p>Their speed, power and unsettling element of surprise make them a terrifying opponent in their underwater territory &#8211; and on land.</p>



<p>One sea lion managed to become an overnight sensation by demonstrating such cunning abilities back in May 2017.</p>



<p>The beast dragged a little girl from behind off a Candian dock in British Columbia in front of horrified holidaymakers.</p>



<p>In another horrifying incident, a 13-year-old girl was mauled by one of the mammals as she frolicked in the ocean in 2019.</p>



<p>Oblivious Megan Pagnini was knee-deep in the ocean at Pismo Beach, California, while her pals filmed her in front of the sunset.</p>



<p>The extraordinary clip shows the sea lion suddenly springing out of the water and attacking the teen as her friends watched in horror.</p>

<p>BRITAIN&#8217;S security services were on high alert on Saturday amid fears Putin&#8217;s army of saboteurs &#8220;could infiltrate the UK to attack key targets&#8221;, it was claimed.</p>



<p>Senior officers at MI5 &#8211; the UK&#8217;s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency &#8211; are said to have warned Home Secretary Priti Patel and her team about the high-level threat from Russia.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chief of Staff Steve Barclay are also understood to have been told of the soaring threat to UK safety which could stem from Russia&#8217;s intelligence service, the FSB.</p>



<p>The fears have now reportedly forced the agency&#8217;s special branch to ramp up the monitoring of all travellers into Britain, sources told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1603708/Putin-Russia-army-saboteurs-Britain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunday Express</a>.</p>



<p>While spooks at GCHQ &#8211;  who provide support and guidance to make the UK safe &#8211; are reportedly liaising with European allies amid the fresh fears, the paper claimed.</p>



<p>The paper says the new plans from the Kremlin are in retaliation for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">Britain&#8217;s relentless support</a> of Ukraine following Russia&#8217;s invasion.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18387718/russia-wipe-britain-off-map-nuke/">threats to the UK</a> could range from “deniable” attacks on vital infrastructure to operations &#8216;intended to humiliate the British government&#8217;.</p>



<p>Kremlin operatives have also allegedly been tasked with reducing public support for the UK Government&#8217;s heroic efforts which are helping Ukraine fight Putin&#8217;s butchers.</p>



<p><strong>It comes as:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18427278/boris-johnson-target-kremlin-cyber-soldiers/">PM is being targeted by cyber soldiers</a> to deliver propaganda</li><li>Putin is on the verge of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18426222/vladimir-putin-declaring-war-ukraine/">declaring all-out war</a> on Ukraine</li><li>An insider claimed Putin is set to undergo cancer operation</li><li><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421644/moment-two-russian-tanks-blasted-bombs-drone/">Dramatic vid</a> shows the moment Russian tanks are blasted</li><li>Britain sends <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18420099/war-crimes-ukraine-britain/">war crimes experts </a>to help Ukraine with investigations</li><li>Another <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18416439/andrew-hill-brit-fighter-paraded-russian-tv-wounded/">British fighter was paraded</a> on Russian state TV</li><li>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408138/brit-scott-sibley-killed-fighting-ukraine/">first UK casualty</a> was named as volunteer Scott Sibley </li></ul>



<p>Such efforts include the UK sending over 10,000 anti-tank NLAW weapons to Ukraine, which have proven invaluable in holding back Mad Vlad&#8217;s invading forces.</p>



<p>Ukrainian troops have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17936782/ukraine-troops-britain-queen-missile/">hailed the lethal British donations</a>&nbsp;as &#8220;beautiful&#8221; and thanked the Queen for the &#8220;gifts&#8221;.</p>

<p>While the British&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18143261/ukrainian-troops-blast-russian-helicopter-british-missiles/">Starstreak</a>&nbsp;high-velocity missile system has also been seen <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18144176/russia-target-british-weapons-accuses-escalating-war-ukraine/">wreaking havoc</a> on Russian forces.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns of what is to come, a security source told the Sunday Express Russia could now infiltrate the UK and launch attacks.</p>



<p>They said: “There is a serious concern that officers or agents attached to Russia’s security services may attempt to enter the UK and target strategic locations.</p>



<p>“We are well aware of their capabilities and have seen how Putin is using these agencies in Eastern Europe.”</p>



<p>Ed Johnson, head of global intelligence at the Sibylline strategic risk group, told the paper saboteurs see Britain as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18414176/west-prepare-war-russia-nato-putin-cruise-missiles-submarine/">number one target</a>&#8221; and will &#8220;aim to sow chaos, panic or distrust in the Government&#8221;.</p>



<p>He claimed this could range from &#8220;taking down a substation and amplifying the effect through a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/18243853/anonymous-leaks-kremlin-files-claimed-hack/">cyber attack</a>&#8221; to bringing &#8220;hard currency into Britain to&nbsp;finance separatist organisations&#8221;.</p>



<p>MP&#8217;s, agents and officials could also be targets for funding while Russian operatives could even be tasked with releasing &#8220;embarrassing documents&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said Russia’s FSB intelligence service “now has a lot to prove” after providing shoddy pre-invasion intelligence which led to Russia&#8217;s catastrophic miscalculation of Ukrainian resistance.</p>



<h2 id="troll-attacks">TROLL ATTACKS</h2>



<p>The claims follow a massive new disinformation campaign launched by Russia which threatens to further destabilise Britain.</p>



<p>Legions of sinister online Russian trolls are expected to amplify prevalent social media accounts that are &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; to Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>It has been claimed trolls will do this by boosting followers and sharing their content &#8211; all the while keeping within the rules of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>



<p>It comes as research funded by the British Government suggests a wave of recent cyberattacks is likely linked to troll farms in St Petersburg.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office believe one facility &#8211; located in a former factory &#8211; is funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka &#8216;Putin&#8217;s Chef&#8217;.</p>



<p>Prigozhin is the founder of Russian bot-farm the Internet Research Agency.</p>



<p>A source close to the research told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/30/russian-troll-farm-accused-recruiting-regular-internet-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a> that on 23 occasions the factory ordered its trolls to the Twitter and Instagram accounts of politicians including Boris Johnson and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. </p>



<p>Foreign Secretary Liz Truss along with British news websites were also targeted.</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the findings, Ms Truss said: “We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin’s war.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added how the Government will continue to &#8220;work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations”.</p>



<p>The Sun Online have approached the Home Office and Foreign Office for comment.</p>



<p>Back in 2018, Russian spies managed to sneak into the UK and launch the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6693507/novichok-poisoning-salisbury-dawn-sturgess-suspects-latest-russian/">Salisbury attack</a>.</p>

<p><strong>VLADIMIR Putin was last night on the verge of declaring all-out war on Ukraine as he prepares to mobilise more forces to step up his merciless assault.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">The Russian president</a> has previously referred to the invasion only as a “special military operation”.</p>

<p>But he is now expected to openly use the word “war” and unleash fresh hell on civilians already pounded by indiscriminate bombing.</p>



<p>Military sources said he was planning to use his country’s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14650081/russias-tanks-missiles-victory-day-parade/">Victory Day Parade</a> in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18390888/how-kremlin-tightly-controls-putin-hide-ill-health/">Red Square</a> on May 9 to announce mass-mobilisation, enabling him to call up more men to fight.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">The tyrant’s</a> hopes of announcing a victory to cheering crowds at the march-past have been dashed by Ukraine’s resistance.</p>



<p>His second-wave assault on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18311365/battle-for-donbas-ukraine-russia-war/">Donbas</a> is killing countless soldiers in artillery duels but making little progress.</p>

<p>As a result, Putin is under growing pressure from generals to unleash an all-out war, with fears growing he will respond with renewed brutality.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> top brass are furious about their humiliating defeat around Kyiv and they blame puffy-faced Putin — who is rumoured to be sick — for putting constraints on operations.</p>



<p>They want permission to blitz more targets in Ukraine, including high-profile government buildings.</p>



<p>Defence Secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15963472/who-is-defence-secretary-ben-wallace/">Ben Wallace</a> said he expected Putin to use his May 9 address to declare “war with the world’s Nazis”.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace told LBC: “He is probably going to declare on May Day that, ‘We are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass-mobilise the Russian people’.</p>



<p>“Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. We have to help Ukrainians and keep the momentum pushing them back.”</p>



<p>Declaring war would let Moscow mobilise fighting-age men to replenish their damaging battlefield losses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> claims it has killed more than 23,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed more than 1,000 tanks, 2,400 armoured vehicles and 345 aircraft.</p>



<p>Western officials have claimed one in four Russian units is no-longer “combat effective” because of their devastating losses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ministry-of-defence/">The Ministry of Defence</a> said Russia had been “forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in north-east Ukraine”. </p>



<p>It added; “Many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale.”</p>



<p>Ukraine’s President <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> said Russian troops were turning the Donbas region “into ruins”.</p>



<p>He said: “In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area.</p>



<p>“Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited.</p>



<p>“Absolutely everything is being decided in this war.”</p>



<p>He warned if Russia succeeded in Donbas it would become like <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18424500/horror-conditions-civilians-kids-mariupol-bunker/">Mariupol</a>, which he called a “concentration camp in the middle of ruins”.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8912206/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky/">Mr Zelensky</a> said the Russians were worse than the Nazis, who occupied eastern Europe 80 years ago, because they were lying about their atrocities.</p>



<p>Hopes of finding a way to evacuate civilians have been dashed day after day, as Russia insists the only way to leave is into Russian territory.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18361839/vladimir-putin-troops-reveal-mission/">Putin’s troops</a> have also established so-called filtration camps where civilians trying to flee are checked to see if they have served in the government, police or military.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the bodies of three more men were discovered in a pit in liberated <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18406214/inside-butchers-bucha-russian-soldiers-named-pictured/">Bucha</a>, near Kyiv.</p>



<p>Officials said their hands and feet had been tied and there was evidence of torture.</p>

<p>THIS is the moment Hollywood star Angelina Jolie was bundled to the safety of a bunker as sirens rang out in war-torn Ukraine.</p>



<p>In defiance of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>’s threats to unleash World War Three, the film favourite visited Lviv &#8211; where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18296999/boy-three-wounded-russian-shelling-lviv/">seven people were killed in a horror missile strike</a> last week.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/angelina-jolie/">Jolie</a> is the biggest Hollywood star to step foot inside the bomb-blitzed country in the latest sign of the world’s support.</p>



<p>She met refugees who had fled devastated Donbas where <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia">Russian</a> troops launched an all-out assault after their defeat at Kyiv.</p>



<p>The UN goodwill ambassador was also spotted in a coffee shop in Lviv in western <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine">Ukraine.</a></p>



<p>And footage has emerged of the star and her entourage being briskly escorted to safety as sirens blared out across the city.</p>

<p>Jolie can be heard insisting &#8220;I&#8217;m okay&#8221; as she waved to the camera.</p>



<p>Her visit to Ukraine will likely enrage the Kremlin after Putin’s right-hand man complained that Western aid to Kyiv amounted to a “proxy war” that could trigger nuclear Armageddon.</p>



<p>She travelled independently with her pal Baroness Arminka Helić – who campaigns against rape as a weapon of war. She was not on an official UN mission.</p>



<p>Dressed in a plain grey tracksuit she signed autographs for locals who thanked her for standing with them in their country&#8217;s darkest hour.</p>

<p>Footage of her coffee shop visit sparked jokes across Ukraine – as it showed a youngster at the next door table engrossed in his mobile phone who did not realise she was there.</p>



<p>Eyewitness Maya Pidhoretska wrote on Facebook: &#8220;Nothing special. Just Lviv. I just went to have coffee. Just Angelina Jolie.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lviv had been considered a safe haven for refugees fleeing to Poland &#8211; about 70km away from its border &#8211; but has come under fire in recent weeks.</p>



<p>The star also visited children undergoing treatment at a Lviv hospital for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April.</p>



<p>The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.</p>



<p>Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram: &#8220;She was very moved by (the childrens) stories.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Jolie went to Lviv’s railway station to meet families evacuating from Pokrovsk, a city in eastern Donetsk which has been blitzed by Russian strikes.</p>



<p>During the visit to the station, Jolie met volunteers working with the displaced, who told her that each of the psychiatrists on duty spoke to about 15 people a day. </p>



<p>Many of those in the station are children aged from two to ten, according to volunteers.</p>



<p>&#8220;They must be in shock &#8230; I know how trauma affects children, I know just having somebody show how much they matter, how much their voices matter, I know how healing that is for them,&#8221; she said in reply.</p>

<p>Jolie also visited an orphanage, a rehabilitation centre and aid distribution point.</p>



<p>The 46-year-old is a special envoy for the United Nations refugee agency, which says more than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in the past two months &#8211; which represents around 30 per cent of Ukraine&#8217;s pre-war population.</p>

<p>TERRIFIED civilians including dozens of kids remain trapped in horror conditions beneath a steel plant as brave Ukrainians stage a final stand against Russia in the besieged city of Mariupol.</p>



<p>Horrifying footage shared by solidiers <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18283107/ukrainian-defenders-mariupol-tunnels-steelworks-russians/">holed up in a bunker under the Azovstal iron and steel works</a> &#8211; the port city&#8217;s last remaining holdout &#8211; shows mums and tots among those desperately waiting to be evacuated.</p>

<p>Mariupol has been battered by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> troops ever since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> ordered his troops into Ukraine in February &#8211;&nbsp;with large parts of the city reduced to rubble by constant air and artillery pounding.</p>



<p>Troops defending Ukraine from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian&nbsp;</a>36th Marine Brigade and the Azov Battalion are using tunnels underneath the steelworks to make a last stand against the Russians.</p>



<p>The plant has become the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18353693/brit-fighters-trapped-mariupol/">final refuge for hundreds of Ukrainians in Mariupol</a> &#8211; including 60 children, according to Commander of Ukraine&#8217;s 36th Separate Marine Brigade Major Serhiy Volyna&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as the hero Ukrainian troops cling on to the final piece of Mariupol, the United Nations has been frantically brokering a civilian evacuation from the last Ukrainian stronghold in the bombed-out ruins of the city.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s estimated around 100,000 civilians remain in the city &#8211; with 1,000 living beneath the sprawling Soviet-era steel plant, according to Ukrainian officials, as food and supplies run out. </p>



<p>Ukraine has not said how many fighters also are in the plant, the only part of Mariupol not occupied by Russian forces, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000.</p>



<p>Graphic videos and images shared from inside the plant purport to show&nbsp;kids holed up there while injured men need stained bandages changed as others have open wounds or amputated limbs.</p>



<p>A skeleton medical staff was treating at least 600 wounded people, two Ukrainian women who said their husbands are among the fighters refusing to surrender there told Associated Press.</p>

<p>Some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene, they said.</p>



<p>According to reports, some kids at the steel plant are losing their hair and teeth because of stress after watching their parents be killed.</p>



<p>A woman identified only as Viktoria told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/low-supplies-and-dirty-bandages-inside-the-living-hell-of-mariupols-azovstal-steel-plant-vkdccklh9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times</a> she has spoken to her brother, a national guard soldier sheltering in Azovstal, who has told her there are &#8220;many elderly and children&#8221; at the plant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some (children) are losing hair and teeth,&#8221; she said, adding that some have grown grey hairs and are starting to stutter.</p>



<p>But with stacks of rubble as a result of constant attacks, some cellars and bunkers at the plant are now feared unreachable &#8211; leaving innocent children trapped.</p>



<p>Russians have control of all of the city except the plant as fighting continues around it, with almost no phone service, electricity or internet access.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s reported at least 20 women and children were evacuated from the plant today,  including six children under the age of 14 &#8211; the first group able to leave since Putin ordered the plant be sealed off last week.</p>



<p>The facility has a series of bunkers underneath it, dating from the Cold War when they were built to protect its workers from nuclear attack.</p>



<p>The highly secure, maze-like bunkers are thought to contain around 1,500 Ukrainian troops and go six storeys underground.</p>



<p>It comes as Putin&#8217;s furious army chiefs have <a href="http://thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">urged him to launch an all-out war on Ukraine</a> as &#8220;payback&#8221; over the shambolic invasion, officials have warned.</p>



<p>Russia&nbsp;had expected it could march across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>&nbsp;without much of a fight when troops invaded for a &#8220;special operation&#8221; in February &#8211; but they have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance</a>&nbsp;and weeks of fighting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;army chiefs have become increasingly frustrated with the scaled-down offensive in eastern Ukraine and his handling of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a>&nbsp;&#8211; with a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; exploding in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a>.</p>

<p>Military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>

<p>A BRAVE mum waited seven hours to be brought to safety after she was bitten by Australia&#8217;s most venomous snake while hiking in a remote gorge.</p>



<p>Megan Brouwer, 36, was with her husband and five-year-old son when the venomous serpent lunged at her in the Karijini National Park &#8211; located 300km from the nearest town. </p>

<p>It took seven hours for rescue workers and emergency services to lift her from the bottom of one of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">West Australia&#8217;s</a> steepest gorges and bring her to safety.</p>



<p>The family had just started their return hike in the picturesque Knox Gorge when Ms Brouwer&#8217;s husband yelled &#8220;snake&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just knew in the way that he yelled it that it was either on me or very close to me,&#8221; she told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-29/karijini-knox-gorge-western-brown-snake-bite-rescue/101027146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;So I jumped around frantically for a moment then saw it in the corner of my eye, slithering away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she looked down at her legs and saw blood and a puncture wound from the brown snake. </p>



<p>Luckily, an off-duty doctor was nearby and applied a bandage to the wound.</p>



<p>The doctor, who had a first aid kit to hand and a satellite phone, managed to raise the alarm with the emergency services.</p>



<p>Ms Brouwer said: &#8220;[The off-duty doctor] had a pressure bandage and applied that for me. </p>

<p>&#8220;She also had a satellite phone in hand… but unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t connecting, we were so far in the gorge.</p>



<p>&#8220;So she then ran to the top of the gorge &#8211; which took her about an hour or so.&#8221;</p>



<p>It took Karijini rangers, local police, State Emergency Service, and St John Ambulance volunteers a mammoth seven hours to bring Ms Brouwer and her family to safety at the nearest hospital.</p>



<p>She was taken across three pools of water while strapped on a stretcher before she was lifted up to a narrow path lined with dozens of loose rocks.</p>



<p>The mum said the exit route was &#8220;pretty hairy&#8221; at times and the whole experience was &#8220;like something I&#8217;d never experienced before&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;The path itself got quite narrow at the edge of the cliff, and manoeuvring a stretcher around trees and up the cliff face was pretty scary for me,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There were also some unexpected things like wasps nests and lots of loose rock so footing was really, really important.&#8221;</p>



<p>Luckily Ms Brouwer had received a &#8220;dry bite&#8221; from the highly poisonous snake.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve since learned that if he had got me a second time maybe that would have been a poisonous bite.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m all good. I know a lot more about snakes and I know how best to be prepared when you&#8217;re hiking in very remote parts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ms Brouwer thanked the rescue team for their efforts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Me and my family thank you all, we are eternally grateful,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The mum also stressed the importance of having a first aid kit on hikes, saying it &#8220;can make all the difference&#8221;.</p>



<p>The gwardar, or western&nbsp;brown snake, is among the most venomous snakes in Australia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A CONTRACTOR thought he had hit the jackpot when he found a whopping £150,000 hidden behind a bathroom wall &#8211; but it ended up being a nightmare. </p>



<p>Bob Kitts was renovating the bathroom of an old home near Lake Erie, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/cleveland/">Cleveland</a> when he found two green locked boxes suspended by a wire below the medicine cabinet.</p>

<p>Inside he found envelopes with a return address for the P. Dunne News Agency.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ripped the corner off of one,&#8221; Mr Kitts said in a deposition in a lawsuit filed by Mr Dunne’s estate, according to the New York Times.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw a 50 and got a little dizzy.”</p>



<p>It turns out the envelopes contained £124,000 and a cardboard box had another £26,000. </p>

<p>But the discovery of the rare late-1920s bills turned into a living nightmare for Mr Kitts as he and the homeowner, Amanda Reece, couldn&#8217;t decide on how to split the money. </p>



<p>She offered to give him 10 per cent of the cash, but he wanted 40 per cent &#8211; and things soon became difficult. </p>



<p>The Dunne estate also later sued, with 21 heirs claiming the rights to the money.</p>



<p>Yet there wasn&#8217;t much left to claim. </p>

<p>Ms Reece testified she had spent about £11,000 on a luxury trip to Hawaii with her mum and she had also sold some of the bills on eBay and to a coin dealer.</p>



<p>She also claimed about £47,000 was stolen from a shoe box in her wardrobe &#8211; although she said she never reported the incident to the cops.</p>



<p>Things became even worse after Mr Kitts said Ms Reece accused him of stealing the money.</p>



<p>She allegedly started leaving him threatening phone messages as the situation turned nasty. </p>



<p>Finally, Ms Reece dropped her claim to the remaining £20,000 and the courts gave Mr Kitts 13.7 per cent and the rest to Mr Dunne’s 21 heirs.</p>



<p>Cuyahoga County probate magistrate, Charles Brown, said the cash in the envelopes belonged to the heirs as they were labelled with Mr Dunne&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>And he said the cash in the cardboard box should belong to Ms Reece as the homeowner &#8211; but she dropped her claim, so Mr Kitts could take the money as he found it.</p>

					</div>
	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->
	



<p>Ms Reece, a mortgage loan officer, testified in a deposition that she had been struggling with debt problems at the time.</p>



<p>Gid Marcinkevicius, a lawyer who represented the Dunne estate, said: “I called it the greed case.</p>



<p>&#8220;If these two individuals had sat down and resolved their disputes and divided the money, the heirs would have had no knowledge of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because they were not able to sit down and divide it in a rational way, they both lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Kitts claimed he lost a lot of business at the time because he was portrayed as greedy.</p>



<p>“I was not the bad guy that everybody made me out to be,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t do anything wrong. It was a neat experience, something that won&#8217;t happen again.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that regard, it was pretty fascinating; seeing that amount of money in front of you was breathtaking. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>VLADIMIR Putin is set to undergo an operation for cancer and will hand over power to his hardline spy chief, a Kremlin insider has reportedly claimed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17833943/vladimir-putin-ill-sick/">Russian tyrant’s health</a> has been source of considerable speculation amid reports that he is battling <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13253481/putin-cancer-parkinsons-emergency-surgery/">both abdominal cancer and Parkinson’s Disease.</a></p>



<figure id="attachment_18424040" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728641183.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18424040" width="960" height="599" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Vladimir Putin will undergo surgery for cancer, it has been claimed[/caption]

<p>But now it has been reported that 69-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin </a>could soon vanish as he goes under the knife, with power transferred to Nikolai Patrushev.</p>



<p>Shadowy Patrushev, 70, is seen as a key architect of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">Ukraine war</a> strategy and the man who convinced Putin that Kyiv was awash with neo-Nazis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The claim was reported on Russian media outlet General SVR, which first raised issues of Putin’s health around 18-months ago.</p>



<p>They quote an anonymous former high-ranking Kremlin military figure as saying: “Putin has discussed that he will be undergoing medical procedures.”</p>

<p>In video in which the source, whose voice appears to have been disguised, reveals that “doctors insist that he needs an operation, but the date has not yet been determined”.</p>



<p>“He will have surgery and while he is incapacitated,” he says, adding that he “thinks it&#8217;ll be for a short time”.</p>



<p>The source said the choice of spymaster Patrushev, which came after a two-hour “heart to heart” with Putin, was the “worst option”.</p>



<p>He went on to speculate that Putin’s health problems could deteriorate.</p>

<p>“What if, all of a sudden, Putin manifests particularly severe health problems?,” he said.</p>



<p>“We know very well that he has cancer, and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, as we have said many times.</p>



<p>“It was possible to contain it for some time, but now the course of the disease is progressing.”</p>



<p>When exactly Putin will go into hospital is unclear but it is unlikely to before May 9, when he presides over the grandiose Red Victory Day commemoration of the defeat of Hitler.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18421044/putins-generals-war-on-ukraine-payback-losses/">UK&#8217;s Defence Secretary&nbsp;Ben Wallace&nbsp;warned </a>Putin could use the day to announce the mobilisation of his reserves for a final push in Ukraine.</p>



<p>He told LBC: &#8220;He is probably going to declare… that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got…and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.”</p>



<p>It comes as military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>



<p>An all-out war would allow Moscow to draft in more conscripts, impose martial law and also bid for support from its international allies &#8211; such as Belarus.</p>

<p>THIS is the dramatic moment two Russian tanks were obliterated in a drone strike as Vladimir Putin loses more than 23,000 troops.</p>



<p>Striking footage showed the devastation caused by the strike from what was believed to be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine&#8217;s</a> 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18421715" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 454px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BOMB-1.png?strip=all&amp;w=444" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18421715" width="444" height="310" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Twitter/@Osinttechnical</figcredit></figure>Two Russian tanks were obliterated in a Ukrainian drone strike[/caption]

<p>In the clip the drone hangs in the air as it appears to eye up its <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> targets &#8211; understood to be Kurganets-25 tanks.</p>



<p>It then drops the bombs, plummeting towards the oblivious war machine before a strike rips apart the tank in a massive inferno.</p>



<p>It is unclear where the attack took place.</p>



<p>The shocking footage of the strike was shared online by the editor of the OSINT Bunker Podcast.</p>

<p>The humiliating scenes come as Putin&#8217;s troop losses now amount to more than 23,200, <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/general-staff-23000-russian-troops-killed-in-ukraine-since-feb-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyiv Independent</a> reports.</p>



<p>According to the figures, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> has also lost more than 1,000 tanks and 190 planes.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Britain&#8217;s Defence Secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15963472/who-is-defence-secretary-ben-wallace/">Ben Wallace</a> estimated some 15,000 Russian troops have been killed.</p>



<p>He told MPs more than 2,000 of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18367077/satellite-images-show-true-scale-of-putins-tank-graveyard/">Putin&#8217;s armoured vehicles have also been destroyed</a> or captured.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace said: &#8220;This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles.</p>



<p>&#8220;Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted Russia has suffered &#8220;significant losses of troops&#8221; &#8211; calling it &#8220;a huge tragedy for us&#8221;.</p>



<p>After failing to capture Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has turned cities to rubble and killed thousands, Russia is now focusing on the east and south of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Russian troops continued to pound Ukraine&#8217;s eastern Donbas region on Saturday &#8211; but failed to capture three target areas, Ukraine&#8217;s military said.</p>



<p>The Russians were trying to capture the areas of Lyman in Donetsk and Sievierodonetsk and Popasna in Luhansk, the General Staff of Ukraine&#8217;s Armed Forces said in a daily update. </p>



<p>&#8220;Not succeeding &#8211; the fighting continues,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>Moscow hopes to take full control of the eastern Donbas region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk &#8211; parts of which were already controlled by Russian-backed separatists before the invasion.</p>



<p>Russia claimed its troops had struck 389 Ukrainian targets overnight on Friday.</p>



<p>Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, saud Russians were shelling the entire region &#8220;but they cannot get through our defence&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A senior US defence official said Moscow&#8217;s offensive is going much slower than planned.</p>



<p>The official believes the Russians are at least several days behind where they wanted to be as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east.</p>



<p>&#8220;As Russian troops try to move north out of the bombed-out city of Mariupol so they can advance on Ukrainian forces from the south, their progress has been slow and uneven and certainly not decisive,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence also said Russian forces are likely to be suffering from &#8220;weakened morale, along with a lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Russian forces have been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in northeast Ukraine,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>RUSSIA&#8217;S lethal anti-tank mine which can blast 100ft in the air and fire explosives from above has been seen in Ukraine for the first time.</p>



<p>The so-called &#8220;smart-mine&#8221;, which is triggered when its target gets within 100m, has never been used on the battlefield before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>&#8216;s PTKM-1R top-attack mine launches itself into the air, scanning the ground for its target, and then firing an explosive slug from above.</p>



<p>Armoured vehicle turrets have thinner plating, making them more vulnerable to attack.</p>



<p>The mine, which is believed to have been introduced into service by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a>&#8216;s army in 2020, is similar to the US M-93 &#8220;Hornet&#8221; wide-area munition.</p>



<p>It was reportedly discovered in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> on April 26, in the latest sign of further military escalation in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">conflict</a> there, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/29/russia-military-anti-tank-weapons-mines-deployed-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>.</p>

<p>The mine contains sensors that listen for the sound of approaching vehicles, interpreting the vibrations to detect whether or not a tank is rolling by.</p>



<p>In theory, the mine is intelligent enough to distinguish between tanks and other vehicles, ignoring civilian cars and less important military hardware.</p>



<p>A picture was shared on Twitter of one of the mines placed in a field in Ukraine, reportedly taken three days ago.</p>



<p>The mine is placed on the ground facing upwards with its eight legs folded outwards, according to the <a href="https://armamentresearch.com/russian-ptkm-1r-top-attack-anti-vehicle-mine-documented-in-ukraine-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Armament Research Services</a> blog.</p>

<p>Four directional acoustic sensors and seismic sensors are set off when the target vehicle comes within 100m.</p>



<p>At this point, the projectile&#8217;s flight path is calculated, and onboard systems put the target in their sights.</p>



<p>The mine then tilts down at a 30-degree angle towards the tank.</p>



<p>When it gets close enough, a 6.2lb explosive warhead is launched around 100ft into the air, as the mine&#8217;s infrared censors scan the ground below for the tank.</p>



<p>An explosive metal projectile is fired from the warhead at such high speeds that it can penetrate 7cm (almost three inches) of steel armour.</p>



<p>This whole launch process takes just a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Tank armour has improved greatly in recent years and is often made from lighter ceramic alternatives to the traditional steel plating.</p>



<p>This means they are far more manoeuvrable while still protecting the crew inside.</p>



<p>Weapons developers have, therefore, tried to create a new generation of high-tech anti-tank weapons which strike from above, targeting the weaker turrets.</p>

<p>In November last year, the Russian military posted a video on YouTube, demonstrating the PTKM-1R&#8217;s power.</p>



<p>Slow-motion footage captures the moment it strikes an unmanned tank, hanging in the air for a split second before firing down at its target.</p>



<p>It isn&#8217;t known if the weapon has been used to destroy any Ukrainian tanks so far.</p>



<p>The country has become a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18123507/russian-tanks-annihilated-driver-runs/">graveyard for Russian tanks</a>, and Ukraine&#8217;s military estimates that as of Friday, 986 have been destroyed since the start of the war.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18046624/britain-ukraine-anti-tank-missiles/">Britain has sent thousands of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine</a>, greatly aiding the war effort.</p>



<p>The Next-generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon, or NLAW, is just a metre long, making it easy to carry on the battlefield.</p>



<p>It has a range of up to 800m and can penetrate armour more than 500m away, despite its relatively low cost of just £20,000 each.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, drone footage captured the moment an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">entire Russian tank column was obliterated</a>.</p>



<p>Troops from the Ukrainian 54th Mechanized Brigade reportedly targeted the terrifying column of tanks with UAV corrected artillery.</p>



<p>They destroyed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a>&nbsp;convoy in just a matter of minutes with a series of devastating strikes from hundreds of feet in the air.</p>



<p>Incredible footage shows the combat vehicles being taken out one by one in Donetsk &#8211; reportedly forcing any surviving soldiers to withdraw.</p>



<p>The tanks exploded into fireballs, leaving the narrow country road littered with scraps of the vehicles.</p>

<p>It comes as a former Nato chief warned that the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18414176/west-prepare-war-russia-nato-putin-cruise-missiles-submarine/">West must &#8220;prepare for war with Russia,&#8221;</a> sparking fresh fears of a global conflict.</p>



<p>Russia released a propaganda video on Friday of a submarine launching a volley of cruise missiles from under the Black Sea at Ukrainian targets.</p>



<p>Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy strategic commander for Europe, told&nbsp;BBC Radio 4’s Today program&nbsp;the Kremlin was likely to respond aggressively but assisting Ukraine was still the &#8220;right approach&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;The worst case is war with Russia.</p>



<p>&#8220;By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin himself darkly warned he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">could use nuclear weapons against the UK and European allies</a>&nbsp;in a speech earlier this week.</p>



<p>Today Russian state TV broadcast a chilling map claiming to show how fast a Sarmat ICBM could strike from the Kaliningrad enclave in the Baltic.</p>



<p>It gleefully warns Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>

<p>VLADIMIR Putin&#8217;s furious army chiefs have urged him to launch an all-out war on Ukraine as &#8220;payback&#8221; over the shambolic invasion, officials have warned.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> had expected it could march across <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> without much of a fight when troops invaded for a &#8220;special operation&#8221; in February &#8211; but they have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18236322/entire-russian-tank-column-obliterated-hero-ukrainians/">faced a valiant resistance</a> and weeks of fighting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin&#8217;s</a> army chiefs have become increasingly frustrated with the scaled-down offensive in eastern Ukraine and his handling of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">deadly war</a>&nbsp;&#8211; with a vicious &#8220;blame game&#8221; exploding in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a>.</p>



<p>Military bosses have now urged Putin to drop the term &#8220;special operation&#8221; used for the invasion and instead declare war on Ukraine &#8211; which would enable the mass mobilisation of Russian troops.</p>



<p>An all-out war would allow Moscow to draft in more conscripts, impose martial law and also bid for support from its international allies &#8211; such as Belarus.</p>



<p>A source close to Russian military chiefs told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/29/vladimir-putin-poised-declare-all-out-war-ukraine-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>: &#8220;The military are outraged that the blitz on Kyiv failed.</p>

<p>“People in the army are seeking payback for failures of the past, and they want to go further in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The UK&#8217;s Defence Secretary&nbsp;Ben Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408151/putin-world-war-three-within-days/">warned Putin could use Russia&#8217;s victory day parade on May 9</a> to announce the mobilisation of his reserves for a final push in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told LBC: &#8220;He is probably going to declare… that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he’s got.. and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. </p>

<p>&#8220;We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.&#8221;</p>



<p>And ex-Nato chief&nbsp;Richard Sherriff warned the West must &#8220;gear itself up&#8221; for a &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; with Russia in Ukraine.</p>



<p>The editor of the state-owned broadcaster RT Margarita Simonyan said it was “more probable” that Putin would launch a nuclear strike than allow&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;to lose the war.</p>



<p>Mr Sherriff told BBC Radio 4: &#8220;The worst case is war with Russia. By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s top generals are already <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398930/vladimir-putin-generals-ukraine-war-disaster-coup/">said to be turning on the tyrant</a> over the invasion as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18141050/vladimir-putin-ousted-two-years/">fears of a military coup</a> mount.</p>



<p>The powerful Russian &#8220;siloviki&#8221; &#8211; or security bloc &#8211;&nbsp;have reportedly blamed Putin for a &#8220;serious error&#8221; after retreating from the capital of Kyiv and concentrating on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18299762/russia-new-offensive-eastern-ukraine-zelensky-donbas/">taking control of the Donbas in the east</a>.</p>



<p>Thousands more Russian troops have poured into eastern Ukraine &#8211; but they are making limited advances.</p>



<p>Putin’s military chief General Valery Gerasimov is now thought to be heading to the frontline to inject &#8220;momentum&#8221; and &#8220;authority&#8221; into the struggling troops.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are credible reports that he is going to go forward,” one western official reportedly said.</p>



<p>&#8220;In overall terms, it does show the continuing command and control challenges that the Russians are having.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="dwarves-in-the-kremlin">&#8216;DWARVES IN THE KREMLIN&#8217;</h2>



<p>Igor Girkin, a retired military intelligence officer who led separatist forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has slammed Moscow&#8217;s &#8220;failures&#8221; in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In a post online, he said: &#8220;What else has to happen before the dwarves in the Kremlin realise they are in an all-out, harsh war and start to act accordingly?&#8221;</p>



<p>And Alexander Arutyunov, a retired Russian commando and usually a pro-Kremlin blogger, said: &#8220;Vladimir Vladimirovich, can you please make up your mind: are we fighting or are we playing around?&#8221;</p>



<p>The ex-military intelligence commander&nbsp;said: “Strike them all over, completely destroy all their aerodromes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Turn them into Moon craters so that not a single plane with a Bayraktar [military drone] can take off.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must destroy all their railway lines with missiles of such big size that they spend years&nbsp;repairing&nbsp;them…</p>



<p>&#8220;If I understand it, why don’t your top guys get it? This is beyond me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Russia analyst&nbsp;Alexey Muraviev has previously warned that Putin faces a&nbsp;potential coup&nbsp;from within his military and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Mr Muraviev told Sky News Australia that the coup may come as they want to try and win the war &#8211; not to stop aggression in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;I think that there have been tensions between Russia and the intelligence community and Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because clearly, there&#8217;s been a clear error of judgment that was made and it was probably driven by Putin himself about the situation in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;About the initial planning and the initial phase of the invasion where the Russian military naturally assume that they&#8217;re going there as liberators rather than the invaders.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that sort of false narrative was presented to them by the Supreme Commander in Chief, and when it fired back when the Russians began taking heavy casualties, Putin began quietly blaming the security services.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which I don&#8217;t think went really well also because he&#8217;s coming from within the security apparatus.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes as Britain announced it is sending around 8,000 of its troops &#8211; the largest deployment in Europe since the Cold War &#8211; to take part in exercises across eastern Europe this summer.</p>



<p>British troops will be joined by tens of thousands of troops from Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance.</p>

<p>CALLOUS Michael Jackson rejected his once devoted chimp Bubbles because &#8220;he got too old &#8211; just like his child pals&#8221; causing the heartbroken animal to attempt suicide, The Sun can reveal.</p>



<p>In an exclusive interview, Adrian McManus, 60, who was one of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-jackson/">King of Pop&#8217;s</a> personal maids, has lifted the lids on the horrifying abuse of the animals at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18389129/what-happened-michael-jackson-neverland/">Neverland ranch</a> in California &#8211; claiming chimps were left to run wild and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18393607/michael-jackson-neverland-chimps-attacked-kids-molested-maids/">often attacked children and staff.</a></p>



<figure id="attachment_18415186" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 729px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d66034b-a4a8-4fe2-a597-92a96dcc414a.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=719" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18415186" width="719" height="837" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">MJ is alleged to have rejected Bubbles when got too old</figcaption><figcredit>SIPA - Rex Features</figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_undefined" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 10px"><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475392964.jpg?strip=all" alt=" Bubbles clutches a publicity photograph of him and Michael" class="alignnone" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bubbles clutches a publicity photograph of him and Michael</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Bubbles was believed to be Jacko&#8217;s number one pet, who he treated as his own child, but McManus says Bubbles had been kicked out by the star before she started working for him in 1990. </p>



<p>Despite declaring his love for Bubbles to the world &#8211; even taking him on tour with him and teaching him his famous Moonwalk dance  &#8211; McManus said Jacko never spoke about him and didn&#8217;t even have a picture of him.  </p>



<p>Chillingly she likened his treatment of the lovable chimp to the way he treated the children in his life &#8211; who he would lavish with gifts and attention before ditching them when they grew older.</p>



<p>McManus said Bubbles was abandoned in favour of his younger chimp Max.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bubbles was not in the house or with Michael by the time I started cleaning his room,&#8221; McManus told The Sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;There were no photos of Michael and Bubbles in the rooms I cleaned. Honestly I cannot recall Michael talking in depth about him. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was only when I asked and he never told me where Bubbles was.</p>



<p>&#8220;By then he had moved onto Max. It was a bit like the little boys in his life, when they grew too old they would be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>McManus said that the star confided in her that Bubbles had become dangerous &#8211; and claimed the chimp was as strong as 35 men.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael told me that Bubbles was too dangerous to have in his house as he was now a teenager and could not be easily controlled,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;He told me &#8216;Adrian, Bubbles has the strength of 35 men, so if anything goes wrong it could be dangerous.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;Interestingly I do recall the personnel manager saying that all the staff had insurance policies for hand injuries on site.</p>

<p>&#8220;The suggestion was that there was coverage for anyone being bitten by the animals. I do not know whether that was because something had happened in the past, but it would not surprise me.</p>



<p>&#8220;If Bubbles was as wild and strong as Michael said, and had free rein like Max I could not imagine what could have happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bubbles now spends his life in a retirement home in Florida after allegedly attempting suicide amid the claims he suffered abuse while living with the King of Pop.</p>



<p>The Jackson family has strongly denied Michael abused Bubbles.</p>



<h2 id="suicide-bid">SUICIDE BID</h2>



<p>However the depressed chimp tried to take his own life after he left Jackson&#8217;s zoo of horrors. </p>



<p>He is alleged to have been saved by medics — but no further details of the alleged incident have ever been revealed.</p>



<p>Now 38, which is late-middle-aged in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15672152/worlds-most-horrific-chimp-attacks/">chimpanzee</a> terms, Bubbles is holed up in the Center for Great Apes in Florida — which acts retirement home for famous chimps and orangutans.</p>



<p>This is a far cry from his life with Jacko where he was constantly under the media spotlight.</p>



<p>Tellingly, these days Bubbles will often turn his back when he sees a camera, despite having been the most photographed chimp in the world.</p>



<p>McManus says she attacked twice by Jackson&#8217;s animals, once by Max the chimp and once by Jacko&#8217;s Brandy and Patrick. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18413794" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 747px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1a15063d-08d7-4416-a654-c6512b7dc44c.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=737" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18413794" width="737" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bubbles the chimp now at his new home &#8211; a sanctuary in Florida</figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>



<p>But rather than blame the animals, she points the finger firmly at mad Jackson for thinking he was a &#8220;real life Doctor Doolittle&#8221;</p>



<p>She said all the animals including elephants, giraffes and chimps were untrained and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8590560/michael-jackson-neverland-ranch-rig-paedo-abuse-rooms/">badly treated</a> &#8211; with many dying or just disappearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michael said he was an animal lover, but many animals were poorly treated,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The zoo should not have been there because no-one ever really properly looked after the animals and all of the staff were in danger. I am shocked no-one got seriously injured or attacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michael should never have been allowed to have kept those animals.</p>



<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart to think about all the cruelty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Animals died and disappeared all the time at Neverland, but unusually it was considered normal.</p>



<p>&#8220;No-one seemed to investigate or ask questions. </p>



<p>&#8220;Animal encounters going wrong would be treated like a joke and gossip by staff, rather than actually serious concerns.&#8221;</p>

<p>RUSSIAN soldiers have been complaining bitterly about their shoddy equipment, including flimsy helmets and useless first-aid kids.</p>



<p>In a viral video, a soldier crushes a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> helmet with just his foot to show how poor quality they are.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18420638" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 599px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729557959.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=589" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18420638" width="589" height="901" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Twitter</figcredit></figure>A flimsy Russian helmet displayed by Ukrainian soldiers[/caption]

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">Putin</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18199648/rusich-neo-nazi-mercenaries-collect-ears/">mercenaries</a> have also shared pictures of their inferior first-aid kits alongside the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukrainian</a> one, to show the contrast in equipment.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian kit seems to contain a number of tools, including scissors, an intubation tube to help someone breathe with a blocked airway, and much more.</p>



<p>In contrast, Russian troops have been sent to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/">war</a> with a kit appearing to contain nothing more than several instruction manuals and something to tie off a tourniquet.</p>



<p>Russian mercenaries who allegedly posted the picture on social media complained: &#8220;This is what Putin and Shoigu brought us,&#8221; referring to the defence minister <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18266028/sergei-shoigu-heart-attack-poisoning-claims-leonid-nevzlin/">Sergei Shoigu</a>.</p>

<p>The photo&#8217;s original source is unclear, but it&#8217;s believed it was originally shared on several popular Russian Telegram accounts and blogs, including one which is crowdfunding to buy Putin&#8217;s soldiers equipment.</p>



<p>In a video shared online by a Canadian foreign fighter who joined the Ukrainian military, a Russian helmet is seen being easily crushed underfoot.</p>



<p>A second earlier video shared on Twitter shows two Ukrainian soldiers picking up an abandoned Russian helmet.</p>



<p>One takes off the helmet cover to reveal a large hole where a bullet or shrapnel has torn through the thin metal.</p>

<p>Despite Russia having the fifth biggest military budget in the world &#8211; around £52.4 billion last year &#8211; their own soldiers&#8217; welfare doesn&#8217;t appear to have been a priority.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Russians have invested a lot of money in their military, and I&#8217;m certain the combat first-aid kits would not have broken the bank,&#8221; former White House National Security Council director for Russia Jeffrey Edmonds told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/vladimir-putin-put-on-blast-over-pathetic-first-aid-kits-for-russian-troops-in-ukraine">The Daily Beast</a>.</p>



<p>He went on: &#8220;If I were a Russian soldier, I might think, &#8216;Well, okay, my general health in combat really isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s valued that much,&#8217;. It just shows a level of concern for your soldiers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of Russia&#8217;s military equipment could date back to the 1990s, or even earlier to before the fall of the USSR.</p>



<p>In a briefing last week, the nonprofit investigative group the Conflict Intelligence Team said: &#8220;A modern first-aid kit costs a lot of money, and the Soviet first-aid kit is already in stock, there is no need to buy it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Such a first-aid kit is not useless, but it is much worse than the ones the Ukrainians have… The Ukrainian army has much more time to save the wounded before they die.&#8221;</p>

<p>It follows reports that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18309956/russia-troops-cameras-game-pads-sat-navs-ukraine/">Russia&#8217;s tinpot army</a> has been forced to use off-the-shelf cameras, gamepads, and sat navs to fix up its planes and drones.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s soldiers have become bogged down in Ukraine &#8211; with the country now littered with corpses and the wrecks of Putin&#8217;s vehicles.</p>



<p>Kremlin soldiers have reportedly been left under-equipped, under-resourced, facing starvation, and even suffering from their vehicles running out of fuel.</p>



<p>And photos and videos show some of the ragtag, off-the-shelf gear which Russian troops are being forced to use to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Footage&nbsp;shows a soldier&nbsp;dismantling a Russian military surveillance drone that crashed in Ukraine, only to find that the drone is not as advanced as one might expect.</p>



<p>The clip, released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, shows that the drone uses a Canon camera that is mounted on a board with duct tape.</p>



<p>And the mode dial of the camera has been sealed with glue- not exactly the high-tech military equipment Russia boasts to have.</p>



<p>The camera used in the drone is a Canon EOS Rebel T6i, a £200-£300 DSLR camera launched in 2015.</p>



<p>And elsewhere in the clip, it shows the drone is jerry-rigged with a plastic bottle to use as a fuel tank.</p>

<p>Additionally, a report by Belarusian TV channel VoenTV appears to have accidentally revealed that Russian drones are controlled by cheap Logitech gamepads.</p>



<p>While desperate <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/18342216/russians-creating-mad-max-armour-plated-vehicles/">Russians have been creating &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; vehicles</a> with extra armour bolted on in fear of being wiped up by British anti-tank NLAW missiles.</p>



<p>Pictures from across the war-ravaged country appear to show how Putin&#8217;s monsters have tried to adapt their vehicles to shield themselves as they advance in their bloody invasion.</p>



<p>But the modifications &#8211; which look straight out of the blockbuster dystopian franchise Mad Max &#8211; vary markedly.</p>



<p>One photo shows what looks like a troop carrier with a large bolted-on armour plate covering the windshield.</p>

<p>One person said: &#8220;It’s sad he thought he had a one up on her to propose at the McDonald’s in front of everyone. </p>



<p>&#8220;I just know he wasn’t listening to her cause she probably said how she wanted her proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>A CARIBBEAN leader nicked in a major cocaine bust is said to have moaned to undercover agents that “the British didn’t pay him much”.</strong></p>



<p>British Virgin Islands premier Andrew Fahie, 51, was allegedly held in a sting by agents posing as traffickers from a Mexican cartel.</p>



<figure id="attachment_18419836" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729516601.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18419836" width="960" height="768" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Andrew Fahie was arrested in an undercover sting operation[/caption]



<p>Drug Enforcement Administration officers are said to have recorded him agreeing a £560,000 bung as part of a plot to smuggle thousands of kilos of coke into the US.</p>



<p>News of his arrest broke as the islands, known for banking secrecy, face allegations that corrupt officials stole from a £50million aid package sent by the UK in the wake of a hurricane in 2017. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16154952/who-foreign-secretary-liz-truss/">Foreign Secretary Liz Truss</a> was said to be closely monitoring developments as Fahie faced court in Miami last night.</p>



<p>The father of three was arrested on Thursday along with BVI port boss Oleanvine Maynard and her son Kadeem.</p>

<p>THE UK is sending war crimes experts to help Ukraine with its investigations into atrocities by Russian invaders, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced.</p>



<p>The Foreign Office said the team of experts, due to arrive in neighbouring <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/poland/">Poland </a>in early May, will support the Ukrainian government in gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes and include experts in conflict-related sexual violence. </p>



<figure id="attachment_18420206" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729267287.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18420206" width="960" height="667" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Mortuary workers stand next to stretchers with bags containing bodies of victims in Bucha, northwest of Kyiv[/caption]



<p>Ms <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/liz-truss/">Truss </a>said: “Russia has brought barbarity to Ukraine and committed vile atrocities, including against women.</p>



<p>“British expertise will help uncover the truth and hold Putin’s regime to account for its actions. Justice will be done.”</p>



<p>She went to The Hague yesterday to meet the president of the International Criminal Court, which is probing the atrocities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow </a>does not recognise the authority of the ICC, presenting obvious difficulties.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence said Russia is paying a high price for limited gains of land in Ukraine&#8217;s east.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Battle of Donbas remains Russia&#8217;s main strategic focus, in order to achieve its stated aim of securing control over the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts,&#8221; the department said in its latest intelligence update.</p>



<p>&#8220;Due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bethany Haines &#8211; whose dad David, an ex RAF Scot, was executed in 2014 while doing aid work &#8211; walked up to Kotey, pointed and told him to &#8220;go rot in hell&#8221;.</p>



<p>London-born Kotey was one of the so-called <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5536512/who-alexanda-kotey-el-shafee-elsheikh-where-now/">Islamic State militants nicknamed The Beatles</a> by their captives due to their English accents.</p>



<p>Kotey, along with ringleader Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, and El Shafee Elsheikh&nbsp;were responsible for the brutal killings of several Western hostages, including Alan Henning and David Haines. </p>



<p>Bethany said she could never forgive her father&#8217;s &#8220;remorseless&#8221; killers.</p>

<p>&#8220;These two men are selfish and only care about themselves and until they accept their actions, admit to what they’ve done, and apologise, then there is no chance they will be forgiven by me. I have no pity for them,&#8221; she told the court.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;Celebrating birthdays or Christmas is not an enjoyable experience for me anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;My dad should be celebrating with me, but instead he is in a mass grave in the hills of Raqqa. </p>



<p>&#8220;He hasn’t been laid to rest, he was dumped like a bag of rubbish.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she had &#8220;struggled wondering why monsters, like these two men, are on this earth but my father isn’t&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kotey was emotionless as Judge Thomas Selby Ellis handed his verdict down at Alexandria District Court, Virginia, as Kotey&#8217;s family watched on from the public gallery.</p>



<p>The 38-year-old was given a life sentence for each of the eight counts <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16037495/isis-beatles-member-admits-torture-hostages/">he pleaded guilty to</a> and which are being run concurrently.</p>



<p>Judge Ellis described the sick jihadi&#8217;s actions as &#8220;egregious, violent and inhumane&#8221;.</p>



<p>Speaking of Kotey&#8217;s victims, the judge said: &#8220;These were not prisoners of war, these weren&#8217;t soldiers in the field&#8230; they were soldiers for good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Athea Haines, Haines other daughter, told the court she was just four when her father was killed &#8211; she is 11 now.</p>



<p>The girl sobbed into her mothers arms as she said: &#8220;I miss him so much. Sometimes I get sad when I see my friends from school and club laughing and playing with their dads. </p>



<p>&#8220;That is something I will never have a chance to do again. It is not easy to be that kid in school whose dad was killed by terrorists&#8221;.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Shirley Sotloff, the mother of slain journalist Steven Sotloff, walked closer to Kotey and Elsheikh to address them and demanded they look at her.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;The sickness in our stomachs the minute we wake up and the psychological trauma that we relive over and over and over. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are forever broken by the loss of our beloved son and defined as the people from the horror movie&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kotey pleaded guilty to charges in September last year and apparently agreed to co-operate with US authorities as part of his plea deal.</p>



<p>His charges included four counts of hostage taking resulting in death; conspiracy to commit hostage taking resulting in death; conspiracy to murder US citizens outside the country; conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, hostage taking and murder, resulting in death; and conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation resulting in death.</p>



<p>Kotey admitted he left the UK with the belief that &#8220;the Islamic concept of armed jihad was a valid and legitimate cause and means by which a Muslim defends his fellow Muslim against injustice&#8221;.</p>



<p>He also admitted to capturing hostages and said when that came to an end, he moved onto working in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/isis/">ISIS</a>&#8216; recruitment division.</p>



<p>His charges were in relation to the slaying of four US hostages &#8211; journalists <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16041438/mum-hostage-killed-isis-beatle-begs/">James Foley</a> and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.</p>



<p>Kotey&#8217;s co-defendant, Elsheikh, was convicted earlier this month and is expected to be sentence at a later date.</p>



<p>Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015, and Davis was jailed in Turkey in 2017.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5543527/first-custody-picture-of-captured-brit-isis-fighter-who-was-member-of-the-beatles-beheading-gang-with-jihadi-john/">Kotey</a>&nbsp;grew up in Paddington, West London, and has been described as having a Ghanaian and Greek-Cypriot background.</p>



<p>The jihadi, believed to be aged around 36, was a convert to Islam as a teenager.</p>

<p>A LITTLE boy and girl playfully clamber through a wrecked Russian armoured car — proving that innocent fun can be had in the grimmest of places.</p>

<p>Paul, 45, from Manchester, and Dylan, 22, from Cambridgeshire, travelled to Ukraine alone and were working as volunteers, according to the UK non-profit organisation Presidium Network.</p>



<p>Paul’s mum Linda described his capture as her “worst nightmare”.</p>



<p>She said her son, a Type 1 diabetic who could die without access to insulin, had travelled to Ukraine about ten days ago. She said: “I begged him not to because Russia’s bad.</p>



<p>“I was on FaceTime with him up to 4am on Monday morning and that was it — gone.”</p>

<p>Asked how she was feeling, she replied: “Like I want to die, like I don’t know what to do any more. I don’t know. It’s horrible.” </p>



<p>She said her son was “too caring” and “too kind”.</p>



<p>Sophie Goldring, who went to college with Dylan, said she was in contact with him on Snapchat. She said: “He wanted to go to Ukraine to help.”</p>



<p>Another friend, Allan Moore, 29, said Dylan was “just a kid from a council estate who went out there to help”.</p>



<p>Dylan had been sharing fundraising appeals on Facebook.</p>



<p>In his last message on April 16 he wrote: “At the moment fundraising is for another vehicle to enable us to evacuate more people at a time but the fundraiser will continue and will be updated to what the needs would require at that stage.”</p>



<p>Dylan is believed to have been in Ukraine for at least six weeks.</p>



<p>The Presidium Network, which has been organising relief for civilians in Kyiv, said the men were driving to help a woman and two kids evacuate.</p>



<p>Dominik Byrne, one of the network’s founders, said: “We want to tell the Russians that these aren’t spies. These aren’t military people.</p>



<p>“These are just humanitarian workers who got caught in a bad situation.”</p>



<p>He said the men were mostly helping with the distribution of medical aid and also helping terrified civilians flee to safety.</p>

<p>He and his friends were happily swimming around a sinkhole known as a cenote when someone spotted something lurking beneath the clear water&#8217;s surface.</p>



<p>A young man is heard shouting, raising the alarm to the rest of the group. </p>



<p>Nail-biting footage then shows Osmar edging closer toward the wild animal.</p>



<p>His underwater camera captures heart-stopping footage of the crocodile as it decides where to head next. </p>

<p>In a stroke of luck, the crocodile decides to calmly pass the group and swims off.</p>



<p>Osmar said he was terrified to realise how close he was to danger. </p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I was more than scared, I was shocked, my friends were even more scared than me&#8221;.</p>



<p>The video, shared to TikTok on April 20, has racked up over nine million views and over 752,000 likes. </p>

<p>ANOTHER British fighter captured in Ukraine has been paraded on Russian TV after apparently suffering gunshot wounds.</p>



<p>He was named as Andrew Hill, a dad of four from Plymouth, and appeared to be wounded with a head bandage and his left arm in a sling.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_18416883" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729488712.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18416883" width="960" height="611" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Andrew Hill, from Plymouth, was paraded on Russian state TV after being captured in Mykolaiv[/caption]

<p>Hill looked tired and terrified and kept his head bowed as he looked at the floor, occasionally glancing up nervously as he asked if he would ever get back to England.</p>



<p>He is the third Brit fighter to be held &#8211; after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18284169/second-hero-brit-fighter-sean-pinner-russian-chilling-video/">Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin</a> were also paraded by their Russian captors.</p>



<p>And it comes a day after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18398136/british-fighter-scott-sibley-killed-ukraine-war/">Scott Sibley became the first Briton to be killed in the conflict</a>.</p>



<p>Hill said he had been shot and begged to go to hospital in the forced video appearance today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking weak and fearing for his safety, Hill was subjected to an interrogation on Rossiya 1 state TV.</p>



<p>When he asked how long he would be held before being allowed back to England, he was told: “I can&#8217;t tell you anything about that, but you can rest assured you&#8217;re safe.”</p>



<p>Andy said he was carrying a Czech-made CZ assault rifle when he was captured, and that Russian troops had administered first aid.</p>



<p>The channel said: “Andrew Hill laid down his arms and surrendered to the Russian military in the Mykolaiv region, after the group of mercenaries in which he fought was defeated and he himself was injured.”</p>

<p>He was used to trumpet a Russian message when asked: &#8220;What would you like to say to other Englishmen who decide to go to Ukraine?”</p>



<p>He replied: “They need to really think about it. This doesn’t involve us.”</p>



<p>In other exchanges, the Brit said he was divorced and that his father died on New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>



<p>“Is there anybody else who can care about you?” the TV interrogator asked</p>



<p>He replied: &#8220;My children, I have four children, and I do have a partner whom I’m dating now.”</p>



<p>Hill also explained how he flew to Poland and crossed the border from the town of Rzeszov into Ukraine alone.</p>



<p>He said he was not paid to fight &#8211; contradicting the TV interrogator&#8217;s description of him as a mercenary.</p>



<p>Hill then pleaded: &#8220;Am I safe?&#8221; and was assured he will not be harmed.</p>

<p>He said Russian soldiers had given first aid for the gunshot wound in the arm, and asked if he would be taken to hospital after the interview.</p>



<p>“Yes, you will be taken care of,” the interrogator said.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, ex-soldier Shaun Pinner, 48, was paraded on TV twice and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18289020/russians-taunt-captured-hero-brit-fighter-propaganda/">taunted by Russians</a> who lied that his Ukrainian comrades wanted him dead.</p>



<p>Aiden Aslin, 28, was seen covered in bruises and being threatened with the death penalty in a disturbing video that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18384222/boris-johnson-talktv-video-aiden-aslin-removed-facebook/">Facebook eventually agreed to take down</a>.</p>



<p>Both men were captured during the siege of Mariupol.</p>



<p>Yesterday it was reported that Royal Marines veteran Scott Sibley, 36, had been killed fighting alongside Ukrainian defenders in besieged Mykolaiv.</p>



<p>Friends said he was &#8220;the bravest person&#8221; they knew and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408138/brit-scott-sibley-killed-fighting-ukraine/">showed commando spirit to the end</a>.</p>

<p>THE LEGENDARY Ghost of Kyiv fighter pilot has been killed in battle after Ukraine claimed he shot down 40 Russian warplanes.</p>



<p>The brave fighter became popular at the start of Putin&#8217;s invasion when the Ukrainian military shared an image of him claiming he had shot down ten Russian jets.</p>

<p>Dad-of-one Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29, was killed on March 13, while fighting “overwhelming” enemy forces, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ghost-of-kyiv-who-shot-down-more-than-40-russian-aircraft-dies-in-battle-q3sq0hztx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Times</a> reported.</p>



<p>Ukrainian sources confirmed the identity and his death adding that they expected his helmet and goggles to go for sale at an auction in London.</p>



<p>The 29-year-old from the village of Korolivka in western Ukraine has left behind his wife Olenia and their eight-year-old son Yarik.</p>



<p>He was posthumously awarded Ukraine’s top medal for bravery in combat, the Order of the Golden Star, with the title Hero of Ukraine.</p>

<p>After his death, his parents gave an interview to NPR with his mum Nahtalia recalling how he used to watch the MiG jets when he was younger.</p>



<p>She said via a translator:  “He would always watch the paratroopers in their air exercises.</p>



<p>&#8220;And he would run in their direction to try to see where they landed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since early childhood, he always dreamed of the sky, about flying higher than the clouds.” </p>

<p>She added: “At any opportunity, he would fly close to our house, do a little aerobatic trick. </p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone in the village, every house and all the villages around would know that is Stepan flying.&#8221;</p>



<p>The pilot&#8217;s dad Evon, a construction worker, said the Ukrainian military would not give them any details of his son&#8217;s death.</p>



<p id="last-paragraph">He said: “We know he was flying on a mission. And he completed the mission, his task. </p>



<p id="last-paragraph">&#8220;Then he didn’t return. That’s all the information we have, really.”</p>



<p>Back in March, the Ukrainian military shared a snap showing a person wearing an oxygen mask in the cockpit of an MiG-29 fighter jet, with the caption “Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!”.</p>



<p>The so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17786814/debunked-urban-legend-ghost-kyiv-promoted-ukrainian-govt/">Ghost of Kyiv</a>&nbsp;became a symbol of resistance in the face of Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion after Ukrainian government officials shared macho propaganda of the masked pilot appearing to shoot down enemy planes.</p>



<p>Footage allegedly showed the MiG-29 jet soaring through the air before destroying six Kremlin planes on the first day Putin launched his war.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian government’s official account posted the 38-second clip on their social media back on February 27, writing: “People call him the Ghost of Kyiv.</p>



<p>&#8220;And rightly so – this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircrafts.”</p>



<p>The footage starts with a cartoon mock-up of the plane, before going into the debunked footage of a destroyed Russian jet.</p>



<p>Text then appears on the video, which states: “Ukraine probably got its first ace since World War II. This is the anonymous pilot of the MiG-29, nicknamed the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17796004/who-ghost-of-kyiv-real/">Ghost of Kyiv.</a></p>

<p>THE terrifying moment a huge great white shark swam under a group of paddleboarders has been captured on video.</p>



<p>The footage shows just how close the beast was to the shoreline as beachgoers looked on in horror.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sinister outline of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sharks/">shark</a> could be seen as it stalked the flimsy boards in scenes reminiscent of Jaws.</p>



<p>But luckily for those nearby, it decided to swim on as the short clip came to an end.</p>



<p>The user responsible for the Reddit post, claimed that it was simply a &#8220;normal&#8221; occurrence for regular paddleboarders in certain parts of world.</p>



<p>It came as other users in the comments noted just how calm the onlookers behaved as the huge beast passed by.</p>

<p>“How are these people so calm?! There is a shark in the water,” one exclaimed.</p>



<p>A second wrote: “Awesome sight to behold though. I&#8217;d love to see a shark up close in person.”</p>



<p>While a third added: “Such a beautiful creature. “A big boi too. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swim tho.”</p>



<p>The footage comes just a day after a panicked paddleboarder filmed his terrifying experience at the mercy of a huge tiger shark as it hunted turtles below him.</p>

<p>Video showed Aussie Brodie Moss as he was thrown into the sea after the predator had <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18401385/video-tiger-shark-paddleboarder-brodie-moss-youtube/">chomped on his board by mistake</a>.</p>



<p>Thankfully he was unharmed in the close encounter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He wrote alongside the video on Instagram: &#8220;A humbling reminder for myself that it’s their ocean and I’m just a visitor!</p>



<p>&#8220;I love sharks and this little accident was not the big fellas fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>The viral video was filmed in Western <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a> &#8211; notably one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16671715/australia-shark-attack-map-maulings-year/">the world&#8217;s hot spots for shark attacks</a>&nbsp;on humans.</p>



<p>In November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13265338/man-savaged-shark-bodyboarding-australia/">bodyboarder was savaged to death</a>&nbsp;near Broome, the eighth fatal attack that year.</p>



<p>A year later Brit dad Paul Millachip was mauled to death while swimming in Freemantle.</p>



<p>There were claims he was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16674023/australia-shark-attack-great-white-tiger/">attacked by a great white and a tiger shark</a>&nbsp;at the same time.</p>

<p>In February this year a British diving instructor was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17678121/brit-man-killed-shark-safety-net-australia/">killed by a 15ft great white</a>&nbsp;in Sydney.</p>



<p>Experts say most victims are bitten when the sharks mistake them for prey such as seals.</p>

<p>THE West must prepare for a &#8220;worst case&#8221; war with Russia after Vladimir Putin&#8217;s growing threats to attack, a former Nato chief warned today.</p>

<p>The footage shows a series of Kalibr long-range rockets emerging from the Black Sea and streaking into the sky.</p>



<p>It is the first time Russia has reported using its submarine fleet to attack Ukraine.</p>



<p>Just four days ago &#8220;leaked&#8221; pictures showed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18367747/leaked-pics-show-russian-submarine-loaded-with-nukes/">Kalibr missiles being loaded into a sub</a> in Crimean port Sevastopol.</p>



<p>&#8220;The crew of a diesel-electric submarine of the Black Sea Fleet launched a salvo of Kalibr cruise missiles at the military infrastructure of the Ukrainian armed forces from the Black Sea&#8221;, Russia&#8217;s defence ministry said today.</p>

<p>It claimed the rockets destroyed three electricity substations at Ukrainian railway junctions in Fastiv, Krasnosilka and Polonne.</p>



<p>Russia is said to have switched to firing from submarines at a safe distance after its <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18293640/first-pics-of-sunk-mosvka-sinking-in-flames/">Black Sea flagship the Moskva was sunk</a> in a humiliating blow to Putin.</p>



<p>The Kalibr rocket can reportedly carry conventional or nuclear warheads and strike targets 750 miles away.</p>



<p>Meanwhile residential blocks in the capital Kyiv were hit by yet more rocket blitzes yesterday and today &#8211; killing a journalist and injuring a number of civilians.</p>

<p>One strike came during a visit by UN Secretary-General António Guterres to areas around Kyiv that were pillaged by Russian forces before the retreat. </p>



<p>“The war is evil,” he said while standing beside destroyed blocks of flats in the smashed commuter town of Borodyanka.</p>



<p>Russia was forced to abandon its shambolic assault on Kyiv after heavy losses.</p>



<p>Instead of pursuing a peace deal, the Kremlin has stepped up threats to Western nations supplying military hardware to Ukraine.</p>



<p>Putin himself darkly warned he <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18392256/putin-warns-nukes-west/">could use nuclear weapons against the UK and European allies</a> in a speech earlier this week.</p>



<p>Today Russian state TV broadcast a chilling map claiming to show how fast a Sarmat ICBM could strike from the Kaliningrad enclave in the Baltic.</p>



<p>It gleefully warns Berlin can be nuked in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds.</p>



<p>Last night Britain&#8217;s defence secretary Ben Wallace warned Putin <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18408151/putin-world-war-three-within-days/">could declare a new world war in days</a>.</p>



<p>He said he fears&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/">the Russian tyrant</a>&nbsp;might use traditional Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which commemorate the end of World War Two, for a mass mobilisation of troops.</p>



<p>Those fears were echoed today by Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy strategic commander for Europe.</p>



<p>He told&nbsp;BBC Radio 4’s Today program&nbsp;the Kremlin was likely to respond aggressively but assisting Ukraine was still the &#8220;right approach&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: “The worst case is war with Russia.</p>



<p>“By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.”</p>



<h2 id="cancerous-growth">&#8216;Cancerous growth&#8217;</h2>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s military claims Russia has so far lost 22,000 troops in the unwinnable conflict, which has now entered its tenth week.</p>



<p>Russia switched its focus from occupying the whole country to an attempt to seized the eastern Donbas region and the southern corridor near Crimea.</p>



<p>But Ukraine is continuing to put up fierce resistance, bouyed by its amazing success so far in repelling the much larger invasion force.</p>



<p>Last night Mr Wallace told LBC radio: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he&#8217;s got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.</p>



<p>“We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.”</p>



<p>He vowed Britain would continue sending aid including anti-tank and anti-air missiles and plans to send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18298762/boris-johnson-missile-launchers-ukraine-war/">Stormer armoured vehicles</a>.</p>



<p>And he added he wasn&#8217;t &#8220;rattled&#8221; by the tyrant&#8217;s threats.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Because we have strong Armed Forces and a nuclear deterrent and we’re part of a Nato partnership of 30 nations who outgun him, outnumber him and have potentially all the capabilities at our disposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don’t fear him. I think we should be very grateful in this country that we have a nuclear deterrent, I think that is a really important part of his calculations.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m very grateful that somewhere under the sea, some amazing men and women are deep underwater, hiding, waiting, in case Britain needs to be protected. That’s important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Debanhi kept walking and stopped outside a haulage company at 4.29am.</p>



<p>Another video shows the teenager running towards the motel driveway at 4.35am and looking through the door of a restaurant a minute later.</p>



<p>There are no surveillance cameras in the area where Debanhi was found in the motel grounds, the attorney general&#8217;s office said.</p>



<p>Her body was discovered lying in an open-air cistern on April 21 after a worker noticed a foul smell.</p>



<p>Police had searched the grounds at least four times during her 13-day disappearance &#8211; sparking disbelief and fury from her family.</p>



<p>It remains unknown how she ended up in the cistern, but pathologists believe she was alive when she went in.</p>



<p>Eduardo Villagómez, director of the state’s forensic services, said she hit her head and drowned. </p>



<p>&#8220;She was alive (for a moment) where she was found and there was an opportunity for her to react,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The cause of the death was a contusion to the skull, officials said. </p>



<p>It has not been determined if she fell or was pushed, but the case is being investigated as a homicide.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have to put together the puzzle with what we have and what is obtained to clarify the reason for Debanhi&#8217;s death,&#8221; said Gustavo Guerrero, the attorney general of Nuevo Leon State.</p>



<p>Debanhi&#8217;s father Mario Escobar is not ruling out murder and has considered exhuming her body for a second autopsy.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;There are many hypotheses, like my daughter could have been alive, like could she have been kidnapped, how she fell without seeing, how she could have been placed there.</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, we do not rule out any line of investigation. I think I am calm… because they are answering what we have talked about.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="massive-human-failure">&#8216;Massive human failure&#8217;</h2>



<p>It comes after the family accused investigators of withholding information and not taking the case seriously.</p>



<p>Aldo Fasci, a senior Mexican politician, branded the failure to find Debanhi&#8217;s body sooner a &#8220;massive human failure&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Neuva Castilla motel had been the main focus of the investigation with dozens of volunteers, search dogs and drones meeting there every morning to plan out their search.</p>



<p>Distraught dad Mario blasted police as they removed her body from the scene last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thirteen days here! How many times were you here looking?&#8221; he shouted.</p>



<p>After a national outcry, the attorney general announced two prosecutors had been sacked from the missing persons and kidnapping unit for omitting details.</p>



<p>He released the CCTV images in a new push for transparency as Mexican authorities face claims of failing to tackle an epidemic of crimes against women.</p>



<p>Another young woman María Fernanda Contreras, 26, was found dead just four miles from Debanhi last week.</p>



<p>So far in 2022, at least 41 young women have gone missing just in the suburbs of Monterrey, and more than 1,700 are missing in the state since 2010.</p>



<p>Across Mexico, seven women go missing every day.</p>

<p>Protesters marched in Mexico City and elsewhere following the discovery of the two bodies in Monterrey.</p>



<p>President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador tried to reassure his people in a recent press conference, insisting that the news &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t worry&#8221; Mexicans because it &#8220;happens everywhere&#8221;.</p>
