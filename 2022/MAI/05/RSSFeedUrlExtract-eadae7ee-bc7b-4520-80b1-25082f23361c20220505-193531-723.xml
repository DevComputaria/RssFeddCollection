        <media:description>Miami's Isaiah Wong (2) shoots and scores during the first half of a college basketball game in the first round of the NCAA tournament against Southern California's Drew Peterson (13) March 18, 2022, in Greenville, S.C. An agent for Wong, a prominent college athlete finally said out loud what schools likely hear in private: Pay the player more, or he will transfer to a school that will. The demand made on behalf of Wong provided a rare glimpse into the way elite college sports have been transformed by student-athletes’ rights to earn money through endorsements.</media:description>

        <media:description>Miami guard Isaiah Wong brings the ball up against Southern California during the second half of a college basketball game in the first round of the NCAA men's tournament March 18, 2022, in Greenville, S.C. An agent for Wong finally said it out loud: Pay the player more money or he will transfer and suit up somewhere else. Most observers say Wong, who has apparently opted to stay at Miami, wasn’t the first to make such a demand and certainly won’t be the last.</media:description>

        <media:description>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear delivers the State of The Commonwealth address, Wednesday night, Jan. 5, 2022, at the Capitol in Frankfort, Ky. Beshear sounded increasingly confident Thursday, May 5, that he will have the leeway to take "at least some executive action” to make medical marijuana legally accessible in Kentucky. It was the governor's strongest signal yet that he might singlehandedly allow medical marijuana for Kentuckians suffering from certain medical conditions.</media:description>
