<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Russia launched its all-out attack against Ukraine in February, the world expected the invaders to roll over the country quickly. That didn’t happen, and Ukraine today, though still under assault, has so far thwarted Russia’s ambitions to conquer it.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Russia has also been fighting a quieter war against Ukraine, a cyberwar, deploying what had been considered the most feared state-sponsored hackers in the world. And in the same way that Ukraine has fended off Russia’s military might, it’s been winning the cyberwar as well.</p><aside class="fakesidebar"><strong>[ <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3655933/ukrainian-it-industry-says-it-s-still-open-for-business.html">Ukrainian IT industry says it’s still open for business</a> ]</strong></aside>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In that cyberwar, as always, the terrain is primarily Windows, because it represents the largest and most vulnerable attack surface in the world. The facts about what exactly is going on have been shadowy.

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic did not just disrupt physical meetings and physical office spaces; workflows that relied on in-person interaction, such as signing documents and contracts, were also highly impacted. Electronic signature (e-signature) software has surged in popularity over the past two years as enterprises looked to modify their signature workflows to support a remote workforce, said Holly Muscolino, group vice president for content strategies and future of work at IDC.</p><p>With many companies returning to an in-person office environment or adopting a hybrid workforce approach, where employees work some days in the office and some at home, e-signature vendors are working to convince businesses that they are still relevant. Although the market has slowed down, Muscolino said, “it’s still showing healthy growth, because there are still companies who have not adopted this technology. There is still significant room for adoption.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3656798/top-6-e-signature-software-tools.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week's Patch Tuesday release was huge, diverse, risky, and urgent, with late update arrivals for Microsoft browsers (</span><a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_14.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2022-1364</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Windows (</span><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-26809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2022-26809</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-24500" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CVE-2022-24500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Fortunately, Microsoft has not released any patches for Microsoft Exchange, but this month we do have to deal with more Adobe (PDF) printing related vulnerabilities and associated testing efforts. We have added the Windows and Adobe updates to our "Patch Now" schedule, and will be watching closely to see what happens with any further Microsoft Office updates. </span></p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3657754/aprils-patch-tuesday-a-lot-of-large-diverse-and-urgent-updates.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p><em>Disclosure: Microsoft is a client of the author.</em></p><p>Microsoft this week <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3655747/microsoft-touts-new-hybrid-work-features-in-updates-to-windows-11.html">had an analyst event about Windows 11</a> and a variety of productivity, management, and security features the company has planned. Over the last couple of years, Microsoft has aggressively improved both Windows and Office 365, but the big change ahead is the potential blend of Windows with Windows 365. We’ll see that start by the end of the year. The end game should be what appears to be a Windows desktop that integrates so well with the cloud that it can, when necessary, seamlessly switch between instances to comply with company policy, assure security, and provide recourse on automatic demand from Azure Cloud. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3656609/windows-11-we-havent-seen-anything-yet.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mobile world pitting Apple’s iOS devices against Google’s Android devices, Apple has historically had one distinct advantage: patches and updates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the fragmented nature of Android (hundreds of handset manufacturers versus just one for iOS), it is simply far easier for Apple to quickly and efficiently push out updates in a way that allows a large percentage of users to get updates quickly. That has been true regardless of whether its new functionality or a critical security patch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what's the problem?

<p>There’s a lot of fear of possible Russian cyberattacks stemming from Russia’s attempted takeover of Ukraine. Perhaps the biggest worry —and quite possibly the most likely to materialize — is that these cyberattacks will likely be finely tuned as retaliation for US financial moves against the Russian economy. </p><p>The cyberattacks would be designed not to steal money or data per se, but to harm the US economy by strategically hitting major players in key verticals. In other words, the Russian government might say, “You hurt our economy and our people? We’ll do the same to you.”</p><p>Thus far, there’s no evidence of any large-scale attack, but one could be launched at any time. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3655972/the-russian-cyberattack-threat-might-force-a-new-it-stance.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
