</div>

<p>In March 2022, the Biden administration announced that cyberattacks from Russia were imminent.   Although this is untrue, it shines a light on how unprepared the federal government and the rest of the country are for a nation-state attack.</p>



<p>A nation-state attack is exponentially more serious than ransomware.  Unlike ransomware, a nation attack does not attempt to extort a fee to restore operations.  It simply destroys without regard to consequence.</p>



<p>More importantly, a nation attack accelerates the frequency and sophistication of the attacks.  For over a decade, the United States, Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran have been stockpiling vulnerabilities in the event of a cyberwar. This is the reason why a cyber attack is NOT imminent, because Russia knows that America likely has a larger stockpile with more severe consequences.</p>



<p>When the Americans shut down 3 Iranian nuclear reactors and Russia shut down the Ukrainian electric grid, each of these attacks was accomplished through one vulnerability.  The WannaCry virus infected 250K computers in one day through one vulnerability.</p>



<p>Any nation-state, and most certainly Russia, has dozens if not hundreds of these vulnerabilities.  Rather than one vulnerability, a nation-state attack would deploy numerous vulnerabilities simultaneously entering unobstructed into every server and endpoint and any other device that contained critical information in the nation.</p>



<p>The first line of defense is patch management but this is wholly ineffective because patch management works with known vulnerabilities and these vulnerabilities are unknown by design.</p>



<p>The next line of defense is the antivirus which has not functioned against modern threats for almost a decade yet consumers and businesses and even the federal government blindly throw money at this obsolete vestige from a prior era of computing. So the attack continues.</p>



<p>The last line of defense is EDR / XDR / Zero Trust, which attempts to detect and respond to the full-frontal onslaught nation-state attack.  Unlike ransomware, a nation attack would overwhelm the SOC (Security Operations Center) and it would quickly fall down.</p>



<p>This exposes the largest flaw in the nation&#8217;s defense.  EDR / XDR / Zero Trust / SOC cannot scale to meet a spike in attacks.  For a SOC to double in size, would take months, and a nation-state can increase its attack level in seconds.</p>



<p>As stated earlier, this is not going to happen due to respect for America&#8217;s vulnerability stockpile, however, our defense frameworks should consider the possibility of a nation-state attack. Unfortunately, none of the popular frameworks including NIST, MITRE, and even Jack Voltaic comprehend the possibility of a nation-state attack.</p>



<p>The first nation to contemplate in its national defensive cyber strategy the impact of a national attack will win the cyberwar. The first nation to effectively create cyber defenses that negate a flood of vulnerabilities attacks from a nation-state will rise to the top of the world order because it is no longer exposed to a cyber counterstrike.</p>



<p>There is a solution and that is application whitelisting, AKA allow listing or software asset management.  As NIST has been recommending for the last 7 years, application whitelisting should reside between the patch management and the antivirus layers.  In this way, during a nation-state cyberattack, the application whitelisting will strictly allow authorized applications to run. During this scenario, the volume on the network is substantial and network performance may deteriorate but it will not fall down. Some new good programs may not run properly until the attacks abate, but the goal is resilience, to withstand the attack.  </p>



<p>This resilience gives patch management time to identify the vulnerability and remediate the vulnerability so the attacks abate.  The nation-state will likely deploy more of its stock of vulnerabilities which should also prove futile. At this point, the nation is deploying vulnerabilities faster than it can replenish, until the stockpile falls to zero.  Then America wins.  </p>



<p>Secure the Homeland.</p>

<p><em>Partnership follows announcement of K12 SIX Essential Protections Series, which establishes baseline cybersecurity standards for K-12 educational institutions; Application whitelisting included as one of the dozen standards; PC Matic to support promotion of program and implementation of application whitelisting by K12 member institutions</em></p>



<p><strong>Myrtle&nbsp;Beach, SC</strong> – Today, American cybersecurity firm PC Matic announced it has engaged with K12 Security Information Exchange (K12 SIX) as an industry partner.</p>



<p>The announcement, formalizing the relationship between the cybersecurity software provider and the non-profit threat intelligence community, comes just after K12 SIX announced its “essential protections series.” This series, which was designed by the organization to establish baseline cybersecurity standards for U.S. school districts, provides pragmatic, actionable, and cost-effective implementation guidance to the organization’s member institutions.</p>



<p>Among the essential protections recommended by K12 SIX, PC Matic will work in partnership with the organization to provide application whitelisting guidance and support for its adoption and implementation in school settings.</p>



<p>“Schools across the country are faced with serious challenges in defending against growing cyber threats while dealing with limited resources,&#8221; said Corey Munson, PC Matic Vice President. &#8220;We applaud the efforts of K12 SIX to establish cybersecurity standards for K12 institutions and are proud to join forces with K12 SIX to promote this very important initiative.”</p>



<p>In addition to supporting the promotion of its standards and programs, PC Matic will also establish a data sharing relationship with the organization.</p>



<p>“The education sector has been under constant attack, and these standards are imperative to defending the nation’s school districts from cyber threats,” said Doug Levin, National Director of K12 SIX. “We’re proud to work together with PC Matic to advance this initiative.”</p>

<h3>CyberCriminal Tuesday</h3>



<p><strong>Avoiding cyber crime.</strong>  Hope&nbsp;you and your family had a wonderful Thanksgiving.&nbsp; &nbsp;I refer to the Tuesday after CyberMonday as CyberCriminal Tuesday.&nbsp; The following are a number of tips to help you stay safe&nbsp;this holiday season.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am so grateful&nbsp;that after my career with the FBI I can do what I love to do which is <strong>preventing CyberCrime </strong>victimization.&nbsp; Feel free to share this with your family, staff and clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I joined the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) in 1988 as a support employee. In 1994, I became a Special Agent where my focus was on domestic terrorism, white-collar and hate crimes as well in computer crime investigations. From 2003 to 2018 I was assigned to handle complex CyberCrime investigations in Washington D.C and Nashville, TN.<br><br>During my decades I interacted with over one thousand victims of cybercrime, each of which affected me personally, and learned that one of the most common elements about Cyber Crime was that many good, smart people became unwitting victims.&nbsp;<br><br>Since retiring from the FBI in early 2018, I offer Cyber protection strategies to individuals, groups and businesses through my book <em><a href="#the-secret-to-cybersecurity">The Secret to Cybersecurity</a></em>, and at meetings. By sharing my life’s journey in the Cyber Crime Field, I want everyone to acknowledge that there is a problem and I try to make it simple by breaking things down to what I call the “<strong>Four Truths About Cyber Security</strong>.”</p>



<h3>Four Truths</h3>



<p><strong>Truth One</strong>&nbsp;– Nobody expects to be a victim.<br><br><strong>Truth Two</strong>&nbsp;– Once the Cyber Criminals steal your money, the chances of a full recovery are slim to none. If the money is out of your bank account or already converted into gift cards, neither the bank nor the credit card company are responsible for helping get the money back.<br><br><strong>Truth Three</strong>&nbsp;– The chances of law enforcement bringing Cyber Criminals to justice is challenging at best. Even with digital clues, such as emails, social media accounts and 1-800 numbers, tracing the crime back to the actual perpetrator is practically impossible. And if you think that following the money trail is a viable strategy for recovery, more times than not you are led to foreign bank accounts that are subject to rules, regulations and treaties that can result in it taking years to access bank records. By that time, the criminals will be long gone.<br><br><strong>Truth Four</strong>&nbsp;– You can prevent most Cyber Crime incidents without spending money on products, services or even needing a technical background.  Prevent Cyber Crime by empowering the end user with a couple of key pieces of information and no-cost preventive action plans.</p>



<h3>Holiday Shopping</h3>



<p>In 2020, 175 million Americans shopped online between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It is conservatively estimated that 90% of shoppers will engage in online in 2021 resulting in purchases exceeding $910 billion in value. Cyber Criminals always step up their game during the holiday season as they realize most American’s will be shopping online.&nbsp;Learn how avoiding cyber crime with good cybersecurity practices can keep you and your family safe..<br><br>My goal is to help you reduce your chances of becoming the next Cyber Crime victim without having to purchase products, services or being technical. If people would implement some or all of the following tips, Cyber Crime would rapidly decline.</p>



<h5>Holiday Cyber Safety Tips</h5>



<p><strong>As sure as snow is white</strong>, the day after Cyber Monday you will get an email, text message or telephone call from someone purporting to be from your bank, credit card, Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart or Costco customer service rep or from UPS, FedEx or the Post Office claiming there was an issue with your purchase or that your package has a delay in shipping. <br><br><strong>This is a Cyber Criminal knocking on your door.</strong> The Cyber Criminal is trying to <strong>trick you into clicking on a link</strong> that will result in their having access to and stealing your username and password. You have given them the key to your account and personal information that you probably use elsewhere.</p>



<h5>Think Before You Click.</h5>



<p>Think before you act. Become a human firewall. Take the time to log into your account through your phone app or go to the website. Never call the telephone number in the email as you might be calling the Cyber Criminal.</p>



<h5>Keep Your Passwords Secure</h5>



<p>Keep your passwords secure. Remember, the Cyber Criminal’s greatest chance for success is when they know your username and password. Just think of the havoc they can cause if they steal your account log-in credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<h5>Use Different Usernames and Passwords</h5>



<p>Do not be one of the 66% of the population who uses the same username and password for multiple accounts. If the Cyber Criminal steals your password from one online retailer, there is a good chance they will use it to compromise your other accounts.</p>



<h5>NEVER use a debit card for Online Shopping.</h5>



<p><strong>NEVER</strong> use a debit card for shopping online. There are numerous safeguards to using a credit card or even PayPal over a debit card.</p>



<h5>Beware Fake Websites</h5>



<p>If it looks too good to be true, it is. <strong>Cyber Criminals </strong>create fake websites that look amazingly real. Only purchase products on legitimate websites. Doing a little bit of due diligence (e.g., how long the company has been in existence or reading on-line reviews) goes a long way to not being a victim.</p>



<p>Only do on-line purchasing from sites that have encryption to protect your information. Make sure the URL is legit. The domain name should start with HTTPS and NOT HTTP. The “S” at the end indicates the site has secure socket labels. Also check for a “lock” at the left of the URL, which is standard for all secure sites.</p>



<h5>Check Your Statements</h5>



<p>Check your bank and credit card statements regularly. You can do everything correctly and the merchant could still have a data breach. You can more quickly correct an issue the faster you discover the discrepancy or error on your statement.</p>



<p>Understandably, there are risks when using Google Pay, Venmo and other apps to pay or transfer funds. Once you send someone money it is as good as gone. Be sure you know who you are paying or sending money to.</p>



<h5>Use Two-Factor Authentication</h5>



<p>Implement two-factor authentication on all the platforms that you use to shop, bank and communicate. This simple free control alone could have prevented most Cyber Crime victimizations.</p>



<h5>Use a Reputable Antivirus</h5>



<p>Make sure you are using a reputable anti-virus product. Being free does not make it good. I personally use <strong>PC Matic</strong> as it is the only <em><strong>U.S based anti-virus company</strong></em>.</p>



<h5>Report Suspicious Activities</h5>



<p>Report suspicious activity or file a scam complaint with the FBI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://cdxnashville.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=662b4c46b7c6bca79a05dfa9c&amp;id=e833022fe9&amp;e=510b040950" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://cdxnashville.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=662b4c46b7c6bca79a05dfa9c&amp;id=e2b1066274&amp;e=510b040950" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.ic3.gov/</a>. You’ll be helping to keep yourself and fellow citizens safe against present and future scammers.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/still-paying-antivirus-software-experts-say-probably-dont-need-rcna6335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC ran an article</a> essentially calling antivirus (AV) dead.</p>



<p><strong>Antivirus prevention</strong> is still an essential part of cybersecurity. &#8220;Viruses are no longer the biggest threats for most users, particularly now that software updates itself automatically and so much personal computing happens over the internet.&#8221; This is the subheading that leads into a lengthy piece about a single cybersecurity expert&#8217;s revelation that his father was paying for multiple layers of protective software. </p>



<p>The death of &#8220;antivirus&#8221; has been the chatter around the virtual tech water cooler for a while now. We don&#8217;t use the term any longer; not because viruses are obsolete but because there are more sophisticated methods of attack. As the article points out, most OS now uses a form of blacklist antivirus. Phishing and poor password hygiene are way more likely to be the culprit in a hack.</p>



<p>But the blacklist antivirus coupled with shoddy passwords and a misunderstanding around phishing can all lead to a hack. It DOES lead to hacks, as we&#8217;ve seen throughout the news, and they aren&#8217;t slowing down. A blanket headline stating to stop paying for antivirus can be a dangerous lead in to further poor practices.</p>



<h3>Traditional Antivirus Prevention is Based on Blacklist AV</h3>



<p>Traditional AV is built on a blacklist, which means it hunts viruses down and blocks them. Collectively we agree that&#8217;s the most ineffective way to go. But <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2021/08/04/idg-whitelisting-zero-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">application whitelisting is underutilized</a>. Even though the consensus is that application whitelisting is the most effective form of protection, some people will hold fast to their antiquated ideas.</p>



<p>In the NBC article, the cybersecurity expert argues that a VPN is great for concealing data. And it is. But if you happen to leave an open RDP port a VPN isn&#8217;t going to help you. Two factor authentication could stop someone getting in that port, unless they&#8217;ve used an elaborate phishing scheme and gained viable credentials. Now they&#8217;re in and they&#8217;re installing some nasty stuff on your machines.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where the application whitelisting layer shines. Even with authentic credentials, a bad actor still wouldn&#8217;t be able to install something unrecognized on the system. And if the user has a PC Matic product installed, the bad actor wouldn&#8217;t be able to delete the application whitelisting defense either. Application whitelisting is the strongest gatekeeper.</p>



<p>This is why prevention is still absolutely necessary in avoiding potentially expensive breaches and hacks. Sure, there are mitigation products on the market that will clean it up once someone&#8217;s in, but is that really the approach you want to take? Isn&#8217;t it easier (and less expensive) to use a proven prevention product? </p>



<p>So is antivirus dead? Yeah, in the traditional sense. But prevention is still key. My advise to the horrified cybersecurity professional hoping to save his dad some money is to invest in a prevention product. <a href="https://www.pcmatic.com/whitelist/" title="Application Whitelisting">Application whitelisting</a> is it. The security layers in nicely with that VPN and two factor authentication he&#8217;s touting. </p>

<p>From 2018 to 2020 insider threats have increased 47% leading to a 31% increase in insider threat costs.  In 2020, the total cost of insider threats was just under $11.5 million.  Today, those numbers are increasing as cyber criminals are offering employees a hefty payday if they infect their corporate networks with ransomware.  </p>



<p>In August an email security company intercepted electronic correspondence that offered employees $1 million to infect their organization’s networks.&nbsp; In another event, again in August, a Tesla employee was offered $1 million dollars to deploy ransomware on their networks as well.&nbsp; So far, no one has taken a bite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that is not to say they won’t. </p>



<h3>If You&#8217;re Faced with Insider Threats, What Can You Do? </h3>



<p>If, or when, a disgruntled employee chooses to take part in these activities, there will be little that the organization can do to stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the cybersecurity tools available do not account for an employee deploying malicious software.  For instance, multifactor authentication, which requires two or more verification methods to grant access to a program, file, or application, is designed to keep outside threats at bay.  Given the threats are coming from within, those individuals will have full access and ability to grant the authentication, regardless of what verification methods are needed.  Therefore, multifactor authentication essentially becomes useless.  </p>



<p>The barriers for an insider to execute the threats are far less, than for a hacker to try to install the malware.&nbsp; This in itself makes it worth the payout to the rogue employee.&nbsp; They can infect more businesses in a more efficient manner.&nbsp; The only work they have to do is find a willing culprit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One may think that it takes a cyber genius to install malware, specifically ransomware, on a device.  You couldn’t be further from the truth.  Human error accounts for over 95% of all cyber incidents.  Which is also why it would be incredibly easy, from an employee perspective, to get away with it.  All they would have to claim was that it was a careless click.  </p>



<h5>Sounding Hopeless&#8230;</h5>



<p>That is unless the organization is using a <a href="http://www.pcmatic.com/pro">malware prevention tool like application whitelisting</a>.  </p>



<p>Application whitelisting is a method of proactive security that only allows known, trusted programs to run.&nbsp; As the direct alternative to traditional blacklisting that allows unknown files to run, application whitelisting actively stops anything from running that has not already been vetted and proven safe and secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider this technology when discussing insider threats.  What if the insider downloads the malware as directed by the cyber criminal?  The rogue employee can click on, and even try downloading the malicious file.  However, it will not be allowed propagate throughout the network because it has not been tested and proven safe.  The application whitelisting solution would effectively block this threat. </p>



<p>Given the grim outlook of insider threats increasing, the cyber threat landscape widening, and a majority of cybersecurity tools failing, leading to a <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-research/fortinet-report-ransomware-attacks-up-1070-year-over-year/#:~:text=Ransomware%20attacks%20increased%201%2C070%20percent,attack%20than%20other%20cyber%20threats.&amp;text=67%20percent%20said%20they%20have%20been%20targeted%20during%20ransomware%20attacks.">1070% increase in ransomware attacks</a>, there are few risks one should be willing to take when it comes to cybersecurity.  </p>

<p>Like every other industry, the cyber security industry is constantly moving. Along with that comes changes in the advice from experts to consumers, businesses, and governments on how to best protect their data from the cyber threats of today. However, there&#8217;s one piece of advice that has held strong as a Silver Bullet for protection from cyber threats of the past and of today, including ransomware: backups.</p>



<p>A Silver Bullet in cybersecurity protection is not a mythical solution that solves every single problem, but one that covers the vast majority of your bases and increases the efficacy of your security posture drastically. When you look to the media for advice today, you&#8217;ll find backups to be the top recommendation almost 10% of the time according to our research. We&#8217;re going to explore why backups are no longer the silver bullet they once were, and what solution or solutions have taken its place.</p>



<h4>
		The past is the past. 
	</h4>



<p>There was a time when backups were the Silver Bullet that we all needed. Cyber threats were less advanced, and having good reliable backups was almost all you really needed. Viruses and trojans would work their way into your computer and you could roll back to a version pre-infection with little to worry about. Even after the introduction of early ransomware, backups were still proving to be the most effective way to protect yourself. Encrypted photos and files could easily be retrieved from your latest backup and your day continues on. However, as they always do, cyber criminals looked to improve their success rate in getting the ransom paid; and their number one target? Your backups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent Ransomware infection at software provider <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marketron-marketing-services-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Marketron</a>, their CEO stated &#8220;This issue comes despite significant recent investments in separating backup and disaster recovery…&#8221; Even with these heavy investments into backups, Marketron was still stuck at a standstill with all services down for their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ransomware quickly evolved to target backup drives, network shares, or any place where you could be storing those precious backups if they were found connected to the device. Successfully encrypting your backups increased their odds of receiving a ransom payment to almost 100%. While it was beginning to show spots of tarnish, the cyber security industry continued to latch onto backups as the shinest Silver Bullet.</p>



<p>While writing this piece a new report was published about the <a href="https://www.advintel.io/post/backup-removal-solutions-from-conti-ransomware-with-love">Conti Ransomware Gang</a> describing their practices of targeting on-premise and cloud backups by hunting for privileged users inside your network to access, exfiltrate, encrypt or remove your backups. All but guaranteeing a ransomware payment is coming their way.</p>



<h4>
		The gold standard.
	</h4>



<p>Needing a new approach to backups to keep ransomware at bay, the advice to air gap your backups came to the front line. Air gapping a backup is keeping it disconnected from your device and network when you&#8217;re not actively doing a backup. This potentially makes it impossible for ransomware or other malware to see that you have backups and certainly stops them from encrypting those backups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there are many flaws that come into play with the air-gapped strategy. The more air-gapped your backups are the less reliable they&#8217;re going to be. You&#8217;re keeping the backups separated from your network for longer periods of time leading to backups that have less and less of the information on them that you need. On top of that, malware has been using time-release tactics for years and years now. There is no big leap for ransomware to lie in wait and trigger on a device when it is able to detect backups have been connected and are in progress.</p>



<h4>
		The pivot to theft. 
	</h4>



<p>With air-gapped backups, we discussed the possibility of ransomware evolving to time-release and wait for you to reconnect your backups. The possibility. Ransomware shifting to data theft has long been a guarantee. In early 2020 the FBI was warning industries that ransomware was specifically looking to steal data in an effort to increase the odds that you pay the ransom. Backups or not, if you have any kind of sensitive or customer data and it&#8217;s stolen and released on the dark web, you may be looking at an even more expensive PR problem than just paying the ransom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ransomware gangs like Conti might rely on it as a secondary fallback, data theft can be detrimental to some businesses. For those in Healthcare, Finance, or even Education, it can be a crushing blow for your user or customer data to be released onto the dark web. However, because there&#8217;s a smaller chance that blackmail will be the driving factor to pay the ransom, most ransomware gangs are still focusing on destroying or encrypting your backups to ensure there is no quick road to recovery. A swift end to your ability to do business will drive immediate attention to making a ransomware payment. And who can blame you?</p>



<h4>
		The last line of defense.
	</h4>



<p>What is now painfully obvious, backups cannot be relied on as the silver bullet in your security stack. They still play a critical part, and every security stack should have reaction layers like backups and EDR combined with prevention layers like Firewall and Application Whitelisting. The lack of recommendations surrounding adding prevention layers into security stacks to defeat ransomware is nothing short of astounding. In our research, we saw one single article recommend adding Application Whitelisting to help defeat ransomware. One article out of one hundred and one total articles that we digested to comprise this data set. Prevention is the key to defeating ransomware and without more inclusion in the advice and recommendations that so many look to, ransomware will be here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contrast is so stark between the advice and recommendations from the media and the top institutions around the world. While little to no media coverage recommends Application Whitelisting, almost every top agency in the US and many across the world praise it as an incredibly important solution to add to every security stack.</p>



<ul><li aria-level="1"><b>The National Institute of Standards and Technology</b> (NIST), has recommended controls that everyone should &#8220;Employ a deny-all, permit by-exception policy&#8221; in their environment. Application Whitelisting fulfills this requirement to default-deny all unknown executions and only allow those explicitly permitted.</li><li aria-level="1"><b>The US Department of Homeland Security</b> states that &#8220;Application Whitelisting should be an integral component of a defense-in-depth solution.&#8221;</li><li aria-level="1"><b>The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</b> (CISA) has created a program to fully fund Application Whitelisting for 2 full years inside the Federal Government. Urging Federal Agencies to deploy this into all security stacks.</li><li aria-level="1">In Australia, the <b>Australian Cyber Security Centre</b> lists Application Whitelisting as one of its eight essential strategies to mitigate cyber threats like ransomware including it in every level of their Matruity Model.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">The <b>US Department of Defense</b> (DoD) released the <b>Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification</b> (CMMC) in 2020 recommending application whitelisting for Level 3 and requiring it for Levels 4 &amp; 5 across all of the US Defense Industrial Base.</li></ul>



<p>We&#8217;re not here to completely shut down the notion of backups and their importance. Having good, reliable backups is a critical component of your overall security stack. The problem is that in today&#8217;s environment cyber criminals have evolved to defeat the simple notion of: &#8220;<i>we have everything backed up&#8221;</i>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, adding Application Whitelisting into security stacks will drastically reduce and potentially eliminate the overall threat of ransomware. This practice is recommended by all of the highest agencies in the US and many around the world including in Australia. It&#8217;s time for a new Silver Bullet in Cyber Security, and Application Whitelisting is here to stay.

    <p>About 10 years ago, long before the ransomware pandemic began, the powers that be decided that cyber prevention was futile, and cyber security should exclusively focus on reaction. Development and improvements to legacy preventative solutions were halted in favor of reactive architectures such as antivirus, EDR, XDR, and EPP. A more prudent and effective strategy is a hybrid between prevention and reaction, however abandoning prevention, maximized revenue for the cybersecurity industry.</p>

<h3 id="ransomware-the-looming-threat">Ransomware &#8211; The Looming Threat</h3>



<p>Application Whitelisting for cyber security. Throughout the last 18 months, rarely did a day go by a company, school, government agency, or public municipality went without a ransomware infection. &nbsp;Since January, twelve educational institutions publicly announced being hit with ransomware, with ransom payments ranging from $28,000 to $2,900.</p>



<p>The success behind <a title="Ransom Attacks and How to Stop Them" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/ransomware/">ransomware</a> lies in the ability to alter the malware&#8217;s variant to avoid detection from most security solutions. &nbsp;Most security programs use a blacklist to monitor malware threats. &nbsp;If a program or file is not on the blacklist, it is deemed unknown. &nbsp;The blacklist allows these unknown files to execute. The flaw lies within this methodology. &nbsp;Hackers are able to create new ransomware variants every few seconds, if they so choose. The blacklist antivirus is unaware that a new variant is now running on the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a ransomware variant morphs, it changes its coding. &nbsp;Meaning, the malicious code identified on the blacklist is no longer used. &nbsp;Therefore, the new, unknown, variant is allowed to execute on endpoints using traditional security solutions that implement the blacklist as their primary method of malware detection. The blacklist has become, and will always be, one step behind.</p>



<p>Yet, if the security industry knows the weakness, what is it doing to fix it?</p>



<p>An advanced security method that completely blocks ransomware and malware from running on a system is available. &nbsp;It is <a title="Application Whitelisting" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/whitelist/application-whitelisting.asp">application whitelisting</a>.</p>



<h3 id="application-whitelisting-why-it-s-effective">Application Whitelisting &#8211; Why It&#8217;s Effective</h3>



<p>As cyber security threats continue to advance, so should <a title="Best Endpoint Protection Software" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/endpoint-security.asp">endpoint security</a>. The devices and machines that access the network can compromise the entire system if a hacker&#8217;s malware penetrates the blacklist antivirus security software. Whitelisting blocks any new or unknown program files from executing. Many malware payloads piggyback onto legitimate programs or use macros to trick users into downloading a virus or trojan. With a global whitelist of good programs, these malicious programs simply can not run.</p>



<p>Whitelisting helps prevent the spread of malware viruses on the network. Once on a machine, malware can execute and spread allowing unauthorized access to cybercriminals intent on stealing data and ransoming critical systems.  The <a title="Application Whitelisting Solutions" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/whitelist">application whitelisting</a> <strong>only</strong> allows trusted programs to execute. Ransomware can spread in seconds and only a proactive layer of security can prevent the spread across the network. </p>



<p>Therefore, instead of allowing unknown files to run like the blacklist antivirus software, the whitelist will prevent unknown files from executing until tested and proven safe. &nbsp;Whitelisting technology is far more effective in <a title="Prevent Ransomware Attacks" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/ransomware/how-to-prevent-ransomware.asp">preventing ransomware attacks</a>, including polymorphic variants.</p>



<h4 id="ransomware-can-morph-in-seconds">Ransomware Can Morph in Seconds</h4>



<p>For example, back in 2016 the ransomware variant, Cerber was morphing its code every 15 seconds to avoid detection. &nbsp;However with application whitelisting, regardless of how many times the coding changes, the variants will always be considered unknown. &nbsp;Therefore, since the variants are not on the application whitelist, they will not run.</p>



<p>Often times ransomware campaigns spread through phishing emails, which include a malicious link or attachment. &nbsp;The Vice President of Cyber Security for <a href="https://www.pcmatic.com/company/about.asp">PC Matic</a> states,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;All it takes is one employee to download a malicious attachment from an email to infect your entire network. &nbsp;Use Application whitelisting software to stop malware from executing in the event an employee accidentally downloads malware.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Beyond blocking ransomware threats,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Application whitelisting software can also help prevent the spread of viruses and worms from infecting computers across the entire organization, and causing damage to the company&#8217;s finances, productivity and reputation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>According to the most recent <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2016/12/vb100-comparative-review/">Virus Bulletin Reactive and Proactive (RAP) test results</a> the application whitelist technology, which tests under the company name PC Matic, proactively prevents 99.97% of malware threats. &nbsp;Compare this to the proactive average of all <a title="Security Software Comparison" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/compare-security-software.asp">security solutions</a> in the test, 64.35%, one has to question why they aren&#8217;t implementing this technology sooner. Waiting for a device to have a virus before the solution activates is being reactive. With ransomware attacks organizations need to be proactive and prevent infection in the first place.</p>



<h4 id="application-whitelisting-best-practices">Application Whitelisting Best Practices</h4>



<p>What are application whitelisting best practices and how do IT professionals implement them? Best practices ensure zero-trust access to whitelist applications and tools. Only admins who need to have access to remote desktop tools, server and cloud resources can have permission to do so. Whitelists only include legitimate, safe programs and scripts with valid publisher digital signatures.

<p>Rob Cheng talked with Liz Callaway last week, discussing a variety of cybersecurity topics.  However, as expected, ransomware was a hot topic, as well as the largest ransom demand in the world being issued just days ago. </p>



<h2>Renner of Brazil Targeted with Ransomware</h2>



<p>A handful of attacks had happened since the last time Cheng and Callaway sat down for their TechTalk segment.  This included a few hospitals in Georgia, a couple water treatment facilities in Maine, and the largest retailer in Brazil, Renner.  Unlike the others, the Renner ransomware attack also received a second title.  The largest ransom demand in the world.  The amount, we will get to in a minute.  </p>



<p>First, take a walk down memory lane with me.  In 1989 when ransomware was first introduced as a cyber threat, the ransom demand was less than $100, and the money collected was to be donated to an AIDs foundation.  Fast forward a couple decades and the ransom demands were still hitting home users, with a price tag of a few hundred bucks.  In early 2017, I wrote about the <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2016/02/18/52608/">Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center being hit with ransomware</a>, and being appalled that they paid a $17,000 ransom demand.  As we know, just this year those demands have spiked to the millions after JBS paid $11 million after being hit with ransomware.  But it gets worse.  Renner&#8217;s ransom demand is equivalent to $1 billion USD.  That is insane.  </p>



<p>I take that back.  The amount is massive.  The reaction to these attacks is insane.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over with the expectation of a different result.  That is what organizations are doing to &#8220;prevent&#8221; ransomware attacks.  They keep the same technologies they&#8217;ve always had, use the same best practices or lack thereof, and expect not to fall victim.  </p>



<h2>Beyond Payouts</h2>



<p>In addition to discussing the growth in ransom demands, Cheng and Callaway discussed prevention.  The reactive approach to cybersecurity is not working, and many &#8220;prevention tips&#8221; are actually reactive.  It is imperative that organizations of all shapes and sizes, including the basic home-user, deploy application whitelisting.  By using a <a href="http://www.pcmatic.com">whitelist approach</a>, only tested and proven safe programs can run.  This effectively eliminates the risk of ransomware from running within the network.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.pcmatic.com/company/leadership.asp">PC Matic founder and CEO, Rob Cheng</a> joined Liz Callaway on her radio show to discuss all things cyber.  </p>



<h2>Cyber Regulations</h2>



<p>Several regulations have been implemented, or are the midst of implementation, as a result of recent cyber attacks.  There are compliance certifications and regulatory measures that organizations must be taking in order to conduct business with government agencies.  Hopefully, the federal government drinks some of their own Kool-Aid, and implements these regulations for federal agencies as well.  Perhaps that will help the <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2021/08/04/federal-cybersecurity-audit/">four agencies that almost failed a cybersecurity audit just weeks ago</a>.  </p>



<h2>Cyber Insurance</h2>



<p>with ransomware booming year after year, many companies opted to invest in cybersecurity insurance.  Cyber insurance helps cover the cost of restoration post cyber incident.  This may include paying the ransom demands, replacing servers, paying for third-party assistance, and more.  Unfortunately this safety net may soon end. </p>



<p>The cyber insurance industry is a sinking ship.  They&#8217;re losing far more money than they are retaining, because of the continuous cyber attacks hitting their clients.  It is because of this, that policy renewal is going to be incredibly difficult.  The idea of losing that safety net may cause businesses to be more apt to preventing these attacks from the beginning, instead of relying on solutions that help mop up the mess after the infection.  </p>



<h2>More Infections</h2>



<p>We are halfway through 2021, and to date there have been more ransomware attacks this year than 2020 combined.  The threats are increasing in frequency, as well as sophistication.  Cyber gangs are reorganizing to maximize their threat potential, and have built infection models that encourage victim extortion.  Now is the time to focus on prevention and application whitelisting. </p>

<h3>Whitelisting &#8211; Is it worth the work?</h3>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/uptick-in-malware-targets-the-banking-community/a/d-id/1329541">Information Week</a> reported application whitelisting as an &#8220;extreme&#8221; method for preventing malware.  Is it extreme?  It very well could be.  Application whitelisting goes against the very core of traditional security programs.  </p>



<p>Instead of using a blacklist, which <strong>allows</strong> unknown files to execute until they prove to be <strong>malicious</strong>, a <a title="Application Whitelist" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/whitelist/">whitelist</a> will block all unknown programs from executing until they prove to be <strong>safe</strong>. This is where the &#8220;extreme&#8221; term, may be valid as <em>extremely s</em>ecure.</p>



<h3>Extreme Protection for Extreme Cyber Threats</h3>



<p>While using a <a title="Whitelisting Security Solutions" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/whitelist/application-whitelisting.asp">whitelist security solution</a>, all unknown programs are blocked from running. In order for the program to run, it must first be tested and categorized as either safe or malicious.  This responsibility may fall on an IT department or if you&#8217;re lucky &#8212; the security program will take care of it.  </p>



<p>Regardless, it could be a major responsibility for either party if the whitelist is not already developed, and blocks several programs because they haven&#8217;t been proven safe yet. These two factors determine the complexity of implementing such a security program. With the cost of <a title="Best Ransomware Attack Protection" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/ransomware/">ransomware attacks</a> rising, the additional work to protect endpoints and networks may be worth it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are <a title="Computer Security Software" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/">computer security software</a> products that have been using the whitelist approach for years.  Therefore, their whitelist is far more mature than others who are just now jumping on the whitelist bandwagon.  If users choose a <a title="Compare Software Security Products" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/compare-security-software.asp">security software program</a> with a robust, global whitelist, the workload will be decreases significantly.  </p>



<p>If users choose a security program that conducts all of the malware testing themselves, instead of leaving a burden on a company&#8217;s IT department, the workload drops even more! </p>



<p>PC Matic has been working on application whitelisting for well over a decade, and conducts its own malware research. IT administrators and MSPs simply install PC Matic, and have complete control over the whitelist from a single dashboard.</p>



<p>Most importantly, PC Matic&#8217;s whitelisting solutions prevent malware and ransomware attacks. If a program is not on the whitelist, it can not execute. This keeps devices, endpoints and servers safe. Learn more about comprehensive <a title="Network Security" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/network-security.asp">Network Security</a>, robust <a title="Server Security" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/server-security.asp">Server Security</a> and <a title="Endpoint Protection" href="https://www.pcmatic.com/pro/endpoint-security.asp">Endpoint Security</a> solutions.  </p>



<h3>The Unknowns of Security Software</h3>



<p>Does the work it takes to progress from an ineffective security program to one that uses a whitelist approach outweigh the benefits?  No.  Not even close.  Choose a program that has been using a whitelist approach for years, and will be responsible for the whitelisting and program testing. PC Matic&#8217;s AWL solution will leave you with no more of a workload than your current security solution, but with far better protection.</p>

<p>Upon evaluating the state of eight federal agencies&#8217; digital infrastructures through a cybersecurity audit, it was confirmed, four agencies nearly failed.  Had this been the first cybersecurity audit of those agencies, the scores may not be as alarming.  However, in 2018 a similar audit was conducted exposing many of the same cybersecurity risks.  The reality is, very little progress has been made.  </p>



<h3>Cybersecurity Audit Results</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="302" height="196" src="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/wp-content/uploads/audit-scores.png" alt="" class="wp-image-64099"/><figcaption>Image from Ars Technica</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The scores, reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/08/the-state-department-and-3-other-us-agencies-earn-a-d-for-cybersecurity/">Ars Technica</a>, do not compare those to the audit of 2018; however it is clear little progress has been made in at least four of these agencies.  The audit confirmed many of the departments using legacy Microsoft operating systems that are no longer supported.  This means, they are not using Windows 10.  All other versions of the Windows operating systems, (XP, Vista, 7, and 8) are no longer supported.  Additionally, the audit revealed thousands of accounts remaining active, some for over 150 days, after an employee left, retired or was fired from the agency.  </p>



<h3>Moving Forward</h3>



<p>Most certainly the auditors provided next steps for the agencies, in order to achieve a better score and increase their levels of compliance to best practices.  However, it can also be assumed those same, or very similar, recommendations were provided in 2018.  PC Matic founder and CEO, Rob Cheng states, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The American government has placed a heavy emphasis on finding the responsible parties for the high-profile attacks that have taken place recently.  Alternatively, it is suggested they focus on closing the security holes within our federal agencies to reduce the risk of attack.  The audit clearly reports there are security holes from outdated operating systems, to improper access.   I&#8217;m certain if they dug deeper, they would find holes in the cybersecurity software as well.  It is imperative to close these holes to reduce the threat landscape.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<h3>Closing the Holes</h3>



<p>To close these holes, federal agencies need to update their operating systems to the latest version of Windows 10.  It is also equally important to update any other outdated third-party applications.  Additionally, it is important organizations follow the proper termination of employment policies.  This may include, but is not limited to:</p>



<ul><li>Turning off employee access to the building</li><li>Removing access to company networks <ul><li>VPNs</li><li>RDP access </li></ul><ul><li>Email accounts </li><li>Social media </li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Removing employee access from the network should be rather simple, if proper records are being kept.  For each employee, there should be documentation stating what they have access to.  This enables the access removal process to be expedited.  Additionally, when email access is removed, those emails should be forwarded to the individual&#8217;s supervisor.  This will ensure minimal correspondence falls to the wayside after the employee is no longer with the agency.  </p>



<p>Additionally, w<mark>hen it comes to cybersecurity solutions, it is just as important to ensure only trusted applications are allowed to run within the network.</mark> <mark>Federal agencies can achieve this by following their own advice, and implement a layer of application whitelisting within the existing cybersecurity stack.</mark></p>



<p>Given the recent threats the private and public sectors have faced, it is imperative that each of these organizations heeds the advice of this audit. Cyber threats are growing. It is no longer a minor virus that may worm its way into the network. It is data breaches, ransomware, and in some cases, a combination of the two. The American government must do more to <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2021/07/22/identifying-security-holes/">close its security holes </a>instead of trying to track down the origin of the attack.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s imperative in order to secure the nation&#8217;s secrets, and the data of its citizens.</p>

<p>As prevention has been top of mind for several organizations, PC Matic joins Scott Augenbaum, a 29-year veteran of the FBI who specialized in cybercrimes, to discuss application whitelisting and preventing cyber attacks. </p>



<h2>PC Matic Townhall</h2>



<p>During the one-hour townhall session, four different PC Matic employees discussed the approach PC Matic takes to prevention.  By using application whitelisting at its core, it only allows known trusted programs to execute.  One statement that was reitterated throughout the session was, although PC Matic is now available as a bolt-on to existing security solutions, PC Matic will continue to be a standalone cybersecurity solution as well.  For organizations using PC Matic, their level of protection is hitting the gold standard.  However, for those hoping to achieve CMMC certification, and need a whitelisting layer to do such, PC Matic can work seamlessly with their current security stack.  </p>



<h3>Author and Former FBI Agent, Scott Augenbaum Joins the Mission</h3>



<p>In the latter half of the townhall session, Scott shared his cyber crime experience while working for the FBI.  Admittedly, he felt defeated.  Every organization he talked to believed they were not the target.  Yet, when they were infected there was little the FBI could do to help remediate.  </p>



<p>The issues are plentiful when it comes to pinpointing cyber crime.  First, identifying the true country of origin is difficult in itself, let alone, pinpointing the exact cyber criminal.  Additionally, many of these countries have no ties to American government, making filing any form of charges nearly impossible.  Finally, the FBI could not retrieve any lost data.  This left him wondering what he could do.  After analyzing his victims, he found a common ground and got to work.  </p>



<p>In addition to his work with the FBI focusing on cyber crime, he also wrote the book <em>The Secret to Cybersecurity. </em> To purchase Scott&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNRXYWB">The Secret to Cybersecurity, click here</a>. </p>



<p>Beyond organizations of all shapes and sizes being targeted by cyber crime, Scott also warns of children and the elderly falling victim.  From the careless clicking of kids, to the scams that target the elderly community, it is important we keep them safe.  Scott offers two free chapters of his book, discussing cyber threats facing the young and older generations.  They are accessible <a href="https://mkt.pcpitstop.com/2021/Kids&amp;ElderFraud.pdf">here</a>. </p>

</div>

<p>The video conferencing platform, Zoom, is facing a hefty fine after telling its users they were utilizing end-to-end (E2E) encryption for their platform&#8217;s meetings, when they were not.  E2E encryption means the video conference would be encrypted, or inaccessible, unless the user provided an access, or decryption code.  Zoom claimed they used E2E encryption, when in reality, they used cryptographic keys on their servers.  This means, anyone who had access to the company&#8217;s servers would be able to view and listen to the Zoom meetings.  This could include employees, third-parties, or even hackers who wormed their way into the company&#8217;s servers.  </p>



<h2>It Gets Worse&#8230;</h2>



<p>Beyond lying about their security practices, Zoom was also caught selling customer data.  </p>



<p>The company was sending user data to Facebook, Google, Bing, Hotjar, and several other platforms without the user&#8217;s consent.  The data sent to these third-parties was used to create unique user profiles for advertising and behavioral influencing purposes.  Zoom reported they have since removed the Facebook and Google software development kits (SDKs), to keep user data secure.  They have also claimed to have requested all of the data they shared with these platforms be deleted.  </p>



<p>Lastly, the company is holding themselves accountable for the rush of <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2020/04/03/zoom-bombing-on-the-rise/">Zoombombings </a>the platform faced over the last twelve months.  Initially they were claiming it was the fault of the user, for not utilizing the platform correctly.  However, the true cause was the company&#8217;s poor security protocols.  </p>



<p>In Zoom&#8217;s defense, they faced significant growth over the past year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  With the influx of remote employment and distance learning Zoom quadrupled their usership in a very short amount of time.  However, that is merely an excuse.  Their inability to scale without security issues should be a concern for many, as well as their poor ethical practices of sharing consumer data without consumer consent.  </p>



<h2>Zoom Settlement</h2>



<p>Anyone who had a Zoom account anytime between March 30, 2016 to June 30, 2021, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/zoom-to-pay-85m-for-lying-about-encryption-and-sending-data-to-facebook-and-google/">may be entitled to compensation</a>.  For those who had a paid subscription, the entitled amount is to up to, $25.  For those who used the free version, it is capped at $15.  That seems reasonable, given the company lied about how Zoom meetings were secured and sold customer data without proper consent.  </p>



<h4>How to Get Paid</h4>



<p>The settlement has yet to receive the final stamp of approval, but it is slated to go before the judge on October 21st.  Upon approval, Zoom will develop a list of all registrants they believe are entitled to compensation.  The company will then <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-class-action-settlement">reach out via email or USPS</a> with details on how to claim the funds.  </p>



<p>This will open the doors to major phishing campaigns.  It can be expected, cyber criminals will capitalize on this and begin sending out emails claiming to be Zoom.  The phishing emails will likely include malicious links and/or downloads.  <a href="http://www.pcmatic.com">PC Matic</a> encourages everyone to be very vigilant when it comes to any correspondence from Zoom.  Double check the From and Reply To addresses, and never click on a link or download a document unless you are certain it is secure.  If you find yourself in question, contact Zoom immediately regarding the legitimacy of the email.  </p>

<p>The CSO Global Intelligence Report: The State of Cybersecurity in 2021 shares some interesting statistics on cybersecurity and the rate of infections.  First, over 50% of those surveyed confirmed experiencing an increase in security incidents over the last year.  What is more alarming is, nearly half of those infected reported economic damages, loss of productivity, and data leaks including personally identifiable information.  Perhaps this is why, attack prevention is now top of mind.  </p>



<h2>What is the solution?</h2>



<p>By in large the solution appears to be &#8220;spend more money.&#8221;  Approximately 43% of respondents are planning to increase their attack prevention efforts, while others plan to focus on cloud, network, and privacy security.  </p>



<p>What remains unclear is what those attack prevention efforts look like.  Of course, the idea is to prevent a cyber incident before it happens; however, organizations must understand what that looks like before spending a plethora of cash on a quick fix.  </p>



<h2>Gold Standard to Attack Prevention</h2>



<p><a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2021/06/29/pc-matic-whitelisting/">Application whitelisting</a> has long been identified as the gold standard for cyber threat prevention.  Due to its nature of only permitting tested and proven safe programs to run, the risk of malware worming past this approach is few and far between.  Although application whitelisting is far from new, the evolution of this proactive approach is quite astounding.  </p>



<p>Years ago, application whitelisting required the organizations to do all of the leg work.  They were responsible for developing their personalized whitelist of good programs, and investigate any unknown programs that attempted to run on the network.  The deployment and maintenance of traditional application whitelisting solutions was not feasible.  It created hefty workloads, and left much to be desired. </p>



<p>Taking notice, security vendors began to understand it is <a href="https://techtalk.pcmatic.com/2021/07/15/eric-cole-prevention-application-whitelisting/">their responsibility to develop and maintain the whitelist</a>.  To address this, a global whitelist was developed.  Now, organizations can now deploy this default-deny approach to their networks without the development and maintenance hassle.  This list is created and maintained by the security vendor, completely eliminating the increased workload on the organization&#8217;s staff.  Additionally, there are <a href="http://www.pcmatic.com/pro">whitelisting solutions </a>that can be layered on top of existing security stacks.  Therefore, allowing for immediate attack prevention security without having to completely rip and replace existing solutions.  </p>
