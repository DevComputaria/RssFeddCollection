      <description><![CDATA[The son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos is leading the polls to become the next president of the Philippines—thanks in part to misinformation spreading on TikTok]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6173757"></div></div><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular posts on Joey Toledo&#8217;s TikTok account is a 13-second clip of <a href="https://time.com/6162028/bongbong-marcos-philippines-president-popular/" >Ferdinand &#8220;Bongbong&#8221; Marcos Jr.&#8217;s</a> conversation with Juan Ponce Enrile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the 94-year-old</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrile&mdash;who served as justice secretary and defense minister under Marcos&rsquo; father, the Philippine dictator <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960316,00.html" >Ferdinand Marcos Sr.</a>&mdash;claims that the Philippines was so safe under martial law imposed by the elder Marcos that a Filipino could leave his home unlocked, and &#8220;nobody would touch it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video received 92,000 views, and while Toledo has some doubts about Enrile&#8217;s claims (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just sure if [Enrile&rsquo;s] story is 100% percent accurate because he&rsquo;s already old&#8221;), the 27-year-old says he believes Enrile &ldquo;knows what happened during that time.&rdquo; </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal of the video on TikTok, and many others like it, goes a long way to explaining why Bongbong Marcos looks likely to win <a href="https://time.com/6168999/philippines-elections-celebrity/" >the May 9 presidential election</a>&mdash;potentially returning one of the Philippines&rsquo; most prominent dynasties to power more than 35 years after it was ousted following decades of dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the 32 pro-Marcos TikTok creators TIME contacted would not speak on the record. But one, Toledo from Nueva Ecija province, some 69 miles north of the capital Manila, agreed. Typical of many of his peers, he does not believe the well documented history of the Marcos family&#8217;s <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,958727-1,00.html" >human rights abuses and corruption</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working by day as an IT support desk staffer, Toledo has had his account for eight months but says he noticed a big uptick in followers when he began posting pro-Marcos videos. Toledo says he is not affiliated with the Marcos campaign, and is not paid for his content, but many of his posts to his 22,000 TikTok followers contain outright misinformation. One post, a repurposed video, suggests that the Marcos family&rsquo;s vast wealth comes not from the <a href="https://time.com/4442653/philippines-duterte-marcos-heroes-cemetery/" >looting of Philippine public coffers</a>, but from earnings as a lawyer. Another video asserts that Marcos was &ldquo;the best president in the world&rdquo; during his time in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, they offer insight into how Bongbong Marcos has been able to leverage social media to rewrite the history of his father&#8217;s rule in the Philippines. The Marcos family amassed as much as $10 billion in ill-gotten wealth according to the </span><a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/846731468338347772/pdf/438540WP0Box327377B0Star01PUBLIC1.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Bank and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the dictator, 70,000 &#8220;enemies of the state&#8221; were arrested, 34,000 were tortured, and more than 3,000 killed, according to </span><a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/edsa/infographics/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But through countless TikTok videos, and other social media posts, a false picture of stability and economic growth has been created that leaves many Filipino voters pining for the &#8220;better years&#8221; of the Marcos regime</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcos leads by an unprecedented margin over other presidential contenders in pre-election surveys: Pulse Asia poll conducted in April showed him with a </span><a href="https://www.pulseasia.ph/april-2022-nationwide-survey-on-the-may-2022-elections/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">33-point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over his closest opponent&mdash;opposition candidate Vice President Leni Robredo. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigative reports from Philippine media outlets </span><a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/245402-networked-propaganda-marcoses-rewriting-history/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-yearender-marcos-jr-benefited-most-ele"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VERA Files</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that Marcos benefits from coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media platforms, especially through videos. Alan German, a campaign strategist at Philippine PR firm Agents International, tells TIME that some political content creators are paid as much as $4,700 on a monthly retainer basis&mdash;a small fortune in a country with a $170 monthly minimum wage. Bongbong Marcos, in an April 26 interview with </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/4/26/Bongbong-Marcos-fake-news-trolls.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN Philippines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has denied paying trolls to boost his image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While misinformation is common to social media everywhere, in the Philippines it is especially pernicious. <a href="https://time.com/5505458/facebook-maria-ressa-philippines/" >Facebook can be used data-free</a> on smartphones, but access to the wider internet, including TikTok, costs money. Together with the country&rsquo;s poor digital infrastructure, expensive cellular data and subpar media literacy, Filipinos often have difficulty accessing verified sources of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Facebook remains the dominant social media platform in the Philippines, TikTok has quickly become a widely used source for sharing political news and views in the Southeast Asian nation of 110 million. The Chinese-owned social media company is privately held, so its user data is hard to verify, but a report from </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-tiktok-stats#:~:text=The%20Philippines%20has%2036.0%20million,users%20aged%2018%20and%20above"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataReportal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an independent data aggregator on digital trends worldwide,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found up to 36 million Filipinos use the app. (The same data aggregator reports Facebook has as many as </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2022-essential-facebook-stats-for-q1-2022-v01"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 million users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Philippines.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo says it&rsquo;s fun to make and share pro-Marcos content on the app&mdash;not least because he enjoys getting a rise out of supporters of Marcos&rsquo; rivals. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s just to vex the other party so that they&rsquo;ll have some engagement. You know how Filipinos are: they love clashes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His feckless approach to TikTok may explain why it works so well for him. Jonathan Corpus Ong, a disinformation researcher at Harvard University, says that compared to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, TikTok&rsquo;s algorithm can catapult a user to stardom with just one post in a couple of days. This encourages users like Toledo to create punchy content in bulk in the hopes of winning viral fame. &ldquo;The potential of misinformative content to achieve a &lsquo;viral sensation&rsquo; kind of dynamic is much higher in TikTok than in other platforms,&rdquo; Ong says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristoffer Rada, the public policy head of TikTok Philippines, says that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once a video is flagged for disinformation, TikTok deprioritizes it.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Alex Bowie&ndash;Getty Image</span><span class="caption" >President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos (1917 &#8211; 1989) gives a pre-election campaign speech to supporters in the run up to the Philippine presidential elections of 1986, Manila, Dec. 7 1985.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., was president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. Many celebrate him for projects that survive to this day, including the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the country&rsquo;s longest inter-island bridge. But his two-decade rule was also marred by massive human rights violations, corruption, and stealing from the national treasury. He was ousted in 1986 through a popular uprising, <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960881-1,00.html" >the People Power Revolution</a>, and the Marcos family fled to Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning from exile in 1991, <a href="https://time.com/4583037/philippines-marcos-burial-duterte-human-rights-protest/" >the Marcos family began revising history in its favor</a>, denying allegations of atrocities outright or remaining silent. Family members took up seats in the local government of their home province Ilocos Norte, successfully rehabilitating their image. (The dictator&rsquo;s widow, Imelda, even ran for president in 1998 but eventually withdrew amid low public support.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the Marcos family has leveraged the power of social media to recraft the narrative even more. Political science professor Julio C. Teehankee at De La Salle University in Manila says that Bongbong and the rest of the Marcos family have adapted Marcos Sr.&rsquo;s support networks and vast wealth to create a &ldquo;well-oiled&rdquo; and &ldquo;well-financed&rdquo; social media campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other factors contribute to Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; popularity: Successive governments since the fall of the Marcos regime have failed to address basic social problems. </span><a href="https://psa.gov.ph/poverty-press-releases/nid/165535#:~:text=Among%20families%2C%20the%20First%20Semester,(Tables%201%20and%203)."  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one fifth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Filipinos live below the country&rsquo;s poverty threshold, while the riches are concentrated among businessmen and political families. A </span><a href="https://pidswebs.pids.gov.ph/CDN/PUBLICATIONS/pidspn1818.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a state-run think-tank estimated only around 1.4% of the population are high-income earners, estimated at $43,400 or more annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other factor is the age of the electorate. Around </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/2/8/youth-vote-56-percent-2022.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% of the 65.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registered voters are under 40&mdash;meaning that they either weren&rsquo;t born during the rule of Marcos Sr., or were too young to remember it. Teehankee says that social media, with its mandate to keep content short and succinct, flattens history&mdash;making it easier for myths and disinformation to take hold in the minds of young voters. &ldquo;They do not have any experience or memory or knowledge about the Marcos regime,&rdquo; he says, adding the Millennials and Gen Z appear to be driving much of the support for Bongbong Marcos on social media. Survey firm Pulse Asia also found that 72% of registered voters age 18-24 support Marcos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a tumultuous era in Philippine history, Marcos&rsquo; dictatorship is barely discussed in schools or in </span><a href="https://www.feu.edu.ph/index.php/2022/01/twistedtruths-the-dilemma-of-philippine-history-textbooks/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">textbooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result is that misinformation learned on social media tends to stick&mdash;even when supporters of Bongbong Marcos are confronted with fact-based rebuttals. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say [Ferdinand Marcos] really did steal money,&rdquo; Toledo says. &ldquo;There are a lot of projects built. Some of the money actually materialized.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo believes the fact of the Marcos dynasty&rsquo;s ill-gotten wealth is a falsehood peddled by long-time political rivals <a href="https://time.com/5793685/corazon-aquino-100-women-of-the-year/" >the Aquino family</a>. (After Marcos was ousted, Corazon, the wife of assassinated senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became president from 1986 to 1992 and their son, Benigno Aquino III, was president from 2010 until 2016.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in July 2003 that the $658 million in deposits made by Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda into Swiss bank accounts and foundations was unlawfully acquired. In 2018, Imelda was also convicted of graft related to private foundations she created for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiding unexplained wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Fighting disinformation on TikTok</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some users are crusading against disinformation by creating their own videos that seek to fact-check the historical white-wash. Mona Magno-Veluz, a 55-year-old genealogist and a self-identified history enthusiast, began posting about Philippine historical figures and events in July 2021 to alleviate boredom during COVID-19 lockdowns. On the anniversary of Marcos&rsquo; declaration of Philippine martial law on Sept. 21, she posted a video dispelling the notion that the economy boomed during the dictatorship. She </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JarcgiZgILZqVZfiuT6kaftvlAL6Iq5gazMfBniAEYI/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cited her sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and explained the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sXEMOgybku4j_OcbulPP-N_WG_gFYImOAHOOXNDE2U/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an external Google Docs link in her TikTok&rsquo;s page bio. That video has since had 1.6 million views and over 156,000 likes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of the response to her video was positive, Marcos loyalists attacked her in the comments section of her post. Magno-Veluz says many of them &ldquo;weren&#8217;t interested in understanding the economics. They were just there because they felt outrage that I hinted that the martial law era was not our golden years.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already a college student when Marcos was ousted, Magno-Veluz says she was surprised by how passionate Marcos supporters are in asserting that their version of history is more accurate. She says her critics&mdash;most of whom were too young to remember the Marcos regime&mdash;make her feel like &ldquo;being gaslighted by somebody who wasn&#8217;t there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok says it has partnered with the Philippine commission on elections and local broadcast network GMA News in a bid to combat disinformation on the platform. Leading newswire agency Agence France-Presse also partnered with TikTok to fact-check content shared by Philippine users. TikTok notifies those who post misinformation and takes their accounts down. A spokesperson for TikTok tells TIME that it does not share how many videos or posts have been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 70% of Toledo&rsquo;s posts on his political TikTok account now have disclaimers, which lead to the app&rsquo;s landing site for the May 9 polls. The site contains information about voting, but doesn&#8217;t attempt to fact-check false claims. Toledo says he hasn&rsquo;t received any warning from TikTok for promoting disinformation and adds that he is &ldquo;sure&rdquo; his posts &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t fake.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also says that he isn&rsquo;t worried about the shutdown of his account. &ldquo;The information will always be there. My account may disappear, but the information won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For Philippine voters, that is precisely the problem.</span></p>

<p>Gated communities are known for their manicured lawns, swimming pools, and wealthy residents. In Argentina, they&rsquo;re also known as the home of the world&rsquo;s largest rodents.</p>
<p>On a drizzly afternoon in March 2022, a family of nine capybaras&mdash;the larger ones weighing in at around 130 pounds&mdash;huddle together under the hedges that surround a famous soccer player&rsquo;s mansion. Munching intently on the grass, they barely look up when approached by cars or humans. These are just a few of the hundreds of capybaras that have taken over Nordelta, a private neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, over the last two years.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The capybaras have always been present here. For the first two decades after the community&rsquo;s construction in 1999, they kept themselves hidden, coming out only at night and darting from trees to lakes. But that began to change in 2020. With Nordelta&rsquo;s well-heeled human residents confined to their homes by Argentina&rsquo;s long and strict COVID-19 lockdown, its furrier inhabitants thrived. Spreading out across now empty parks, they reproduced rapidly, boosting their numbers by 16% in one year, according to estimates by local scientists. Then, after an unusually dry winter hit Argentina in June 2021, killing much of the grass in public areas, the capybaras got even bolder, crossing roads and venturing into private gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the conflict started,&rdquo; says Marcelo Canton, head of communications for the Nordelta Residents Association. The capybaras&mdash;known as &ldquo;carpinchos&rdquo; in Argentina&mdash;ate up lawns and massacred rose bushes. They caused traffic accidents, knocking delivery drivers from their bikes. Perhaps worst of all, for a country <a href="https://www.infobae.com/2011/09/16/605985-argentina-el-pais-la-region-mas-mascotas-habitante/"  target="_blank">fiercely devoted </a>to pets, the capybaras began to face off with dogs that confronted them on their new territory, causing injuries to both sides. &ldquo;Dog owners were very upset,&rdquo; Canton says. &ldquo;Especially because here, the dogs are mostly French Bulldogs or other small dogs. They can&rsquo;t defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class="image-wrapper no-caption"></figure>
<p>In July, a group of residents went to the press, griping about a capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; and calling for authorities to move the animals out to a nature reserve. The complaints triggered a huge backlash in both Argentine and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/22/argentina-capybaras-giant-rodents-gated-community"  target="_blank"> international media</a>. Viral posts on social media accused Nordeltans of hypocrisy, since their luxury neighborhood is built on the capybara&rsquo;s historic wetland habitat, with some dubbing the animals &ldquo;class warriors.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t help Nordelta&rsquo;s case that capybaras are extremely cute, with goofy rectangular heads and narrow eyes that make them look permanently sleepy.</p>
<p>But for all the anger leveled at Nordelta, the neighborhood does have a real problem on its hands: how do you deal with an influx of wildlife that wasn&rsquo;t there before in densely populated urban space? Cities around the world are increasingly having to answer that question. The expansion of urban areas, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is destroying the forests, wetlands and other ecosystems where animals have historically thrived. And at the same time, cities have become &ldquo;incredibly enriched environments,&rdquo; often containing an abundance of food, water, and shelter compared to their surrounding areas, says Peter Alagona, an environmental historian and author of<em><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520386310/the-accidental-ecosystem"  target="_blank"> The Accidental Ecosystem</a>.</em> The result is that animals losing their natural habitats are increasingly making the city their home.</p>
<p>Nordelta&rsquo;s confrontation with capybaras is just the beginning. Alagona argues that cities are due for a fundamental rethink of their relationship with urban wildlife. &ldquo;We need to start thinking about cities as multi-species communities, as potential refuges for creatures that, in the future, we may not see in natural spaces,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a grand ecological rearrangement taking place and cities are part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>About 15 miles west of Nordelta,</strong> the grass is tall and the air is full of mosquitoes. Wildcats, lizards, and nutria (the capybara&rsquo;s smaller cousin), roam unseen by humans on roughly 750 acres along the Luj&aacute;n River. Graciela Capodoglio, a former teacher, helped to found this nature reserve in Pilar, a suburb of Buenos Aires, in 2003, around the same time that gated communities began to proliferate around the city. Her goal was to use the space to teach city residents about the importance of protecting nature; today, the reserve is one of the region&rsquo;s last natural wetlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all this development, the animals have been corralled into smaller and smaller spaces,&rdquo; Capodoglio says over the hum of bugs and birds. &ldquo;And now, the whole country is suffering from a drought,&rdquo; which further threatens the wildlife here. The clearing of tens of millions of hectares of<a href="https://time.com/amazon-rainforest-disappearing/" > the Brazilian Amazon</a> and other rainforests, mainly for agriculture, has led, in the last few years, to the disappearance of South America&rsquo;s &ldquo;flying rivers,&rdquo; which once carried moisture across the region. The drier conditions, combined with rising temperature due to climate change, have sapped food and water sources for wildlife, and helped to <a href="https://time.com/5895167/brazil-fires-ricardo-salles-environment/" >spread forest fires.</a> In February, as wildfires lapped at the edges of Corrientes in the north of Argentina, newspapers published <a href="https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/incendios-corrientes-fuego-cede-impactan-imagenes-animales-huyen-llamas_0_jPdLaRffUJ.html"  target="_blank">dramatic images</a> of alligators, capybaras, and other animals fleeing the flames.</p>

<p>Capodoglio was &ldquo;furious&rdquo; when she read news stories about the capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; in Nordelta. And again, in January 2022, when similar stories popped up about <a href="https://www.ambito.com/informacion-general/pilar/alarma-los-countries-una-invasion-lagartos-n5353521"  target="_blank">an invasion of tegus</a>&mdash;black-and-white lizards native to the region&mdash;in gated communities near the Pilar reserve. &ldquo;The word invasion drives me crazy! They were here first,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>In pre-pandemic times, people concerned about tegus on their properties would contact animal rescue shelters to take them away. But with those centers mostly closed because of COVID-19, Capodoglio says the reserve received a rush of calls from concerned residents. &ldquo;I try to explain to them that the poor tegu is an inoffensive animal,&rdquo; she says, noting that the lizards, will cut off their own tails to run away from dogs or larger animals that catch them. &ldquo;And it helps you keep rats out of your house! Why do we need to look at all animals as attackers? It&rsquo;s such an anthropocentric view. It pisses me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over in Nordelta, Canton, of the residents association, says that the group that wanted to remove all capybaras from the neighborhood was a minority of about a hundred out of some 45,000. After the media firestorm, he says, a second group of &ldquo;environmentalist residents&rdquo; spoke up, opposing any measures that could affect the capybaras or their urban habitat. &ldquo;Then finally, a third group in the middle came up, who said &lsquo;okay we have to respect the animals, but what are we going to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 2021, that group made their case for some kind of intervention to the wildlife department of Buenos Aires province and in <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/amamos-a-los-carpinchos-la-respuesta-de-los-vecinos-de-nordelta-que-acusan-a-la-provincia-por-la-nid19082021/"  target="_blank">an open letter</a> in the national press. They pointed out that capybaras had been driven almost to extinction by poachers in Tigre, the municipality where Nordelta is located, by the 1990s, and that the creation of the gated community&mdash;where hunters don&rsquo;t venture&mdash;had saved the animals. But, they argued, the area &ldquo;could no longer feed or sustain&rdquo; today&rsquo;s numbers. The province <a href="https://www.infobae.com/salud/ciencia/2021/08/25/cual-es-la-mirada-cientifica-sobre-la-conducta-de-los-carpinchos-en-nordelta/#:~:text=Qu%C3%A9%20dijo%20la%20administraci%C3%B3n%20de,convivencia%20arm%C3%B3nica%E2%80%9D%20con%20la%20fauna."  target="_blank">agreed</a>, based on their observations from a visit in June, that there was an &ldquo;overpopulation&rdquo; problem. They then began to work with the municipal government and the Nordelta residents association&mdash;which acts almost like a local government because of Nordelta&rsquo;s private status&mdash;on a plan to restore &ldquo;harmonious coexistence&rdquo; between capybaras and humans, according to Canton, consulting with capybara experts at Argentina&rsquo;s national scientific research council, and a team of biologists hired by Nordelta.</p>
<p>Limiting capybara numbers is part of the plan. Officials have ruled out the idea of moving some capybaras to nearby nature reserves&mdash;suggested by the residents to bring the population back to the level it stood at five years ago&mdash;on the grounds that they had not learned to fear their natural predators and wouldn&rsquo;t last in the wild, Canton says. And there will, &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; be no culling of the animals in Nordelta, he adds. But capybara vasectomies are on the table. The province is consulting with vets before giving the greenlight for a trial, which would follow a few dominant males and monitor them for several years. A <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/15/deer-wars-and-death-threats"  target="_blank">deer vasectomy program </a>with similar goals in Staten Island has resulted in a <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2021/03/city-releases-new-data-on-controversial-staten-island-deer-vasectomy-program-is-it-working.html"  target="_blank">&ldquo;sizable decrease&rdquo;</a> in the deer population since 2016, but proved controversial among residents and conservationists. &ldquo;That is a mid- to long-term solution,&rdquo; Canton says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the only less natural measure that&rsquo;s under consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, the focus has been on softer measures. First there was an awareness campaign, using newsletters, social media, and outreach to local press to remind residents that capybaras are generally harmless and ideally are dealt with by simply ignoring them.</p>
<p>Next, the residents association began creating new habitats for the capybaras inside Nordelta, so they wouldn&rsquo;t need to resort to gardens. The human residents stopped cutting the grass so often in public parks and near lakes, to make it more comfortable for capybaras, and left some areas on the edges of town to go wild. Then they installed three &ldquo;buffer zones,&rdquo; made up of reeds and bushes for the animals to shelter in, at the edges of lakes within the neighborhood. Three more are under development, along with another site at a currently polluted stream that enters Nordelta from the north.</p>
<p>Canton says the creation of these newly rewilded areas has helped keep capybaras away from residents. The real test, though, will come in the next few months, as the dry winter season in Argentina puts pressure on the giant rodents&rsquo; food supply.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>As the global conversation</strong> around the importance of preserving biodiversity gets louder, many cities are trying to change their designs to enable humans and animals to share urban space in a climate-changed world. In <a href="http://www.wildwestend.london/"  target="_blank">London</a>, for example, the largest landowners in the central West End district are adding vegetation to roofs, walls and streets to create more of the plants needed by native birds, bees and bats. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/23/how-wildlife-crossings-are-helping-reindeer-bears-and-even-crabs-aoe"  target="_blank">Wildlife bridges</a>, which allow animals to safely cross roads or railways that have divided parts of their habitats, are in vogue in many cities: a network of reindeer viaducts are being built across Sweden, the largest ever animal overpass is <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/01/wildlife-crossing-liberty-canyon-los-angeles.html"  target="_blank">under construction </a>in Los Angeles, and in March Houston <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/03/116688-first-part-houston-land-bridge-opens-public"  target="_blank">opened</a> a &ldquo;landbridge&rdquo; connecting the two sides of its Memorial park, which have been separated for a century. Even buildings are being rethought: last year, it became mandatory for new buildings in New York City to incorporate<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-04/how-to-design-buildings-to-prevent-bird-crashes"  target="_blank"> bird-friendly elements,</a> such as patterned glass to prevent crashes.</p>
<p>The increasing threats of flash floods, heatwaves, and drought are prompting cities to restore green space and trees, which can absorb water and regulate temperature. Local governments should recognize that animals have their own &ldquo;ecosystem services&rdquo; to offer, argues Alagona. Rather than employing companies to exterminate rats, for example, cities could plant more trees that are conducive to owl nesting habits, and manage power lines better to prevent owl deaths. &ldquo;If we have more owls, we definitely have fewer rats,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;By thinking about wildlife and coordinating across different departments, we can create an environment that&#8217;s healthier for everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Thursday, South Korea&rsquo;s spy agency became the first in Asia <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220505000162&amp;np=1&amp;mp=1"  target="_blank">to join NATO&rsquo;s Cyber Defense Group</a> in a move that risks inflaming tensions with regional superpower China.</p>
<p>In a statement, South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it had been admitted as a contributing participant for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), a cyber defense hub established in May 2008 in Tallinn, Estonia, focused on research, training, and exercises in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/6164840/estonia-baltics-russia-defense-putin/" ><em>The Ordinary Civilians in Estonia Preparing to Protect Their Country Against Putin</em></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyberthreats are causing great damage to not only individuals but also separate nations and also transnationally, so close international cooperation is crucial,&rdquo; the NIS said.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>In response, Hu Xijin, the strident editor of Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece <em>The Global Times</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1522062382666682369"  target="_blank">tweeted</a> that the move was an affront to Beijing and even lays the groundwork for war in Asia. &ldquo;If South Korea takes a path of turning hostile against its neighbors, the end of this path could be a Ukraine,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Against the background of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea&rsquo;s admission to the group seems to reflect a hardening resolve among U.S. allies in response to mounting threats from, in principle, Moscow and Beijing, which has <a href="https://time.com/6163807/china-russia-putin-ukraine/" >backed Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s adventurism</a>. On April 29, a spokesman for China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/china-calls-russia-relationship-a-new-model-for-the-world"  target="_blank">hailed</a> ties with Russia as &ldquo;a new model of international relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, whether NATO was motivated by events in Ukraine to finally sign off on South Korea&rsquo;s membership is unclear. The NIS submitted its application to join the group in 2019 and has participated in the two most recent Locked Shields, the world&rsquo;s largest international live-fire cyberdefense exercise. The CCDCOE now has 27 NATO member countries and five non-NATO contributing participants.</p>

<p>Prof. Sean O&rsquo;Malley, a political scientist at Dongseo University in Busan, says South Korea&rsquo;s membership is &ldquo;a culmination of a very slow evolution over the past decade of getting cybersecurity to be recognized as a really serious threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite hosting some of the world&rsquo;s top tech companies, like LG and Samsung, South Korea has been a surprising laggard regarding cybercrime and only launched a <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/National_Strategies_Repository/National%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy_South%20Korea.pdf"  target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> under the <a href="https://time.com/6075235/moon-jae-in-south-korea-election/" >Moon Jae-in</a> administration in 2018.</p>
<p>This is despite South Korea being the principle target of <a href="https://time.com/4781809/ransomware-attack-north-korea-wannacry/" >increasingly frequent cyberattacks</a> from across the DMZ. A crack squad of 6,800 North Korean agents are engaged in fraud, blackmail and online gambling that together generate some $860 million annually, according to the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy in Seoul. Many attacks originate from inside China.</p>
<p>And whether motivated by Beijing&rsquo;s backing of Russia or not, the move does certainly bring U.S. allies closer together. &ldquo;This is just one more arrow in the quiver for the United States and its allies,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Malley. &ldquo;And, of course, this is one more capacity where China would prefer South Korea be as independent as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173831/who-covid-19-deaths/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(London) &mdash; The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 15 million people were killed either by coronavirus or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems in the past two years, more than double the official death toll of 6 million. Most of the fatalities were in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>In a report Thursday, the U.N. agency&rsquo;s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the figure as &ldquo;sobering,&rdquo; saying it should prompt countries to invest more in their capacities to quell future health emergencies.</p>
<p>Scientists tasked by WHO with calculating the actual number of COVID-19 deaths between January 2020 and the end of last year estimated there were between 13.3 million and 16.6 million deaths that were either caused directly by the coronavirus or were somehow attributed to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on health systems, like people with cancer unable to seek treatment when hospitals were full of COVID patients.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The figures are based on country-reported data and statistical modeling but only about half of countries provided information. WHO said it wasn&#8217;t yet able to break down the figures to distinguish between direct deaths from COVID-19 and others caused by the pandemic, but said a future project examining death certificates would probe this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may seem like just a bean-counting exercise, but having these WHO numbers is so critical to understanding how we should combat future pandemics and continue to respond to this one,&rdquo; said Albert Ko, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Public Health who was not linked to the WHO research.</p>
<p>For example, Ko said, South Korea&rsquo;s decision to invest heavily in public health after it suffered a severe outbreak of MERS allowed it to escape COVID-19 with a per-capita death rate around a 20th of that of the U.S.</p>

</em></p>
<p>Accurate numbers on COVID-19 deaths have been problematic throughout the pandemic, as the figures are only a fraction of the devastation wrought by the virus, largely because of limited testing and differences in how countries count COVID-19 deaths. According to government figures reported to WHO and to a separate count kept by Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-69e8cbaebb653a0f1cb65ffe33d9afbd"  target="_blank">6 million</a> reported coronavirus deaths to date.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington guessed there were more than 18 million COVID deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 in a recent study published in the journal Lancet, and a team led by Canadian researchers estimated there were more than 3 million uncounted coronavirus deaths in India alone. WHO&#8217;s new analysis estimated there were more than 4 million missed deaths in India, ranging between 3.3 million to 6.5 million.</p>
<p>Some countries, including India, have disputed WHO&#8217;s methodology for calculating COVID deaths, resisting the idea that there were many more deaths than officially counted.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Indian government released new figures showing there were 474,806 more deaths in 2020 compared to the previous year, but did not say how many were tied to the pandemic. India did not release any death estimates for 2021, when the highly infectious <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-new-delhi-coronavirus-health-f2a4d130a41944720d9f687f7c5e53ce"  target="_blank">delta variant</a> swept through the country, killing many thousands.</p>
<p>Ko said better figures from WHO might also explain some lingering mysteries about the pandemic, like why <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-pandemics-united-nations-fcf28a83c9352a67e50aa2172eb01a2f"  target="_blank">Africa</a> appears to have been one of the least affected by the virus, despite its low vaccination rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the mortality rates so low because we couldn&rsquo;t count the deaths or was there some other factor to explain that?&rdquo; he said, adding that the crush of deaths in rich countries like Britain and the U.S. proved that resources alone were insufficient to contain a global outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a public health specialist at Britain&rsquo;s University of Exeter, said the world may never get close to the true toll of COVID-19, particularly in poor countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have a massive outbreak where people are dying in the streets because of a lack of oxygen, bodies were abandoned or people had to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-india-religion-coronavirus-c644fc9eb09beb04e16d0215a6693886"  target="_blank">cremated quickly</a> because of cultural beliefs, we end up never knowing just how many people died,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Although Pankhania said the estimated COVID-19 death toll still pales in comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic &mdash; when experts estimate up to 100 million people died &mdash; he said the fact that so many people died despite the advances of modern medicine, including vaccines, is shameful.</p>
<p>He also warned the cost of COVID-19 could be far more damaging in the long term, given the increasing burden of caring for people with <a href="https://time.com/6158273/long-covid-19-risk/" >Long COVID</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Spanish flu, there was the flu and then there were some (lung) illnesses people suffered, but that was it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was not an enduring immunological condition that we&rsquo;re seeing right now with COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know the extent to which people with Long COVID will have their lives cut short and if they will have repeated infections that will cause them even more problems,&rdquo; Pankhania said.</p>

<p>A power crisis in India that&rsquo;s delivering hours-long blackouts, halting manufacturing lines and triggering street protests is forecast to continue for months, adding pressure on the nation&rsquo;s economic rebound.</p>
<p>Electricity outages and curbs have spread across more than half of all states and the nation&rsquo;s coal-dominated energy system is expected to come under further strain as power demand tops a recent record high in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Even with a temporary reprieve from a blistering heat wave that&rsquo;s delivered temperatures as high as 46 degrees Celsius (115 degrees Fahrenheit), households and businesses face ongoing disruptions as coal stockpiles shrink at power plants and fuel imports falter on prices that&rsquo;ve surged since the war in Ukraine.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s becoming a difficult situation,&rdquo; Sumant Sinha, chairman of ReNew Energy Global Plc, a supplier of wind and solar power in India, said in an interview. &ldquo;The whole summer will be a test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High coal and oil prices threaten to add to inflationary pressures that prompted India&rsquo;s central bank to make a surprise move Wednesday to lift its key policy rate. Power curbs will also hit India&rsquo;s already faltering rebound in industrial production.</p>

<p>Production of coal, the fossil fuel that accounts for more than 70% of India&rsquo;s electricity generation, has failed to keep pace with unprecedented energy demand from the heat wave and the country&rsquo;s post-pandemic industrial revival. Logistics snarls, including a lack of railway carriages to transport the fuel from mines to power plants, are exacerbating the shortages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If power supply is curtailed to the industrial sector, it could delay the recovery in the manufacturing sector by at least one more quarter,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, an economist with ICRA Ltd.</p>
<p>Stockpiles at coal-fired power stations have tumbled more than 14% since the start of April, leaving about 100 plants with critical supply levels, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Reserves are forecast to shrink further on high demand, and that&rsquo;ll be followed by a monsoon season from July.</p>

<h2>India faces &#8216;full-blown power crisis&#8217;</h2>
<p>Monsoon rains triggered a previous power crisis last year &mdash; which also caused widespread electricity curbs &mdash; when coal mines and roads were flooded, hampering production and shipments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If coal stockpiles continue to deplete at this rate, we&rsquo;re going to see a full-blown power crisis across the country,&rdquo; said Shailendra Dubey, chairman at the All India Power Engineers Federation, an advocacy body that produces energy policy suggestions.</p>
<p>Electricity demand hit a record 207.1 gigawatts on Friday and is expected to rise to 220 gigawatts within the next two months, according to India&rsquo;s power ministry. Average spot power prices at Indian Energy Exchange have jumped to about 10 rupees (13 cents) a kilowatt hour, almost triple the average in January, and have been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capped</a> by the industry regulator.</p>
<p>At least 16 of India&rsquo;s 28 states have been grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day, Ashok Gehlot, chief minister of Rajasthan, said Monday in a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ashokgehlot51/status/1520962835928739840"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message</a>, before conditions eased in some areas.</p>

<p>The western desert state, a hub for metal smelters to textile factories, last week ordered power supplies to some industries cut by as much as half. Citizens should limit their use of appliances like air conditioners and coolers in homes and workplaces, Gehlot said.</p>
<p>Maharashtra, home to the nation&rsquo;s financial capital Mumbai, is battling worsening blackouts, said S. Maheshkumar, general secretary at Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association. &ldquo;Industries are worried that they may have to cut production and turn down export and domestic orders,&rdquo; he said by phone.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote">16 of India&rsquo;s 28 states have been grappling with power outages of between two and 10 hours a day</span>Anger over patchy electricity supplies prompted protests across the northern state of Punjab &mdash; India&rsquo;s top grains producer &mdash; over the weekend, with farmers blockading roads as they appeal for a minimum of eight hours of power a day for agricultural use. Already there are concerns about electricity supply during a paddy sowing season from mid-June, Kamaljeet Singh Hayer, a farmer in the state&rsquo;s Ferozepur district, said by phone.</p>

<p>In the coal mining states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, many industries are cutting output or running back-up generators with expensive diesel. &ldquo;If we have to operate like this, we&rsquo;ll all soon be in the red,&rdquo; said Philip Mathew, president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association.</p>
<p>Opposition party members marched Saturday through streets in Jammu, protesting against six-hour daily outages. Blackouts have struck key population centers including Uttar Pradesh, and even where supplies are slowly improving like in Karnataka and Kerala connections still aren&rsquo;t guaranteed around-the-clock.</p>
<p>While Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government isn&rsquo;t yet facing major new dissent, India&rsquo;s economy is under pressure from high energy prices, rising inflation and the impacts of the Covid pandemic, including low employment, said Shumita Deveshwar, senior director of India research at TS Lombard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These have the potential to become bigger political issues in the longer-term,&rdquo; Deveshwar said. &ldquo;If the coal crisis continues for an extended period, it will add to the pressure.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173515/russia-victory-day-history/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Victory Day is always a big holiday in Russia: It marks the Soviet Union&#8217;s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, a conflict during which more than 8 million Soviet soldiers died.</p>
<p>But this year, as Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine continues, the day will take on new meaning. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, there&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-victory-day-explainer-intl/index.html"  target="_blank">speculation</a> about whether Victory Day will mark <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/putin-speech-may-9-victory-day-russia/629742/"  target="_blank">a turning point</a> in the war that has already killed thousands and forced millions to flee from their homes.</p>
<p>In March, the <em>Kyiv Independent</em> reported that Russian troops were being told <a href="https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1507095376247074826?s=20&amp;t=g2UK3kTdZE9mYLyY1za1ow"  target="_blank">the war must end by May 9</a>, while more recently, U.S. and western officials have openly wondered if <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/europe/russia-ukraine-declaration-of-war-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"  target="_blank">Russia will officially declare war on May 9</a>, escalating what Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted is merely a &#8220;special military operation.&#8221; But on May 1, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said, &#8220;Our military will not artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day,&#8221; the Moscow <em>Times </em><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/02/russia-not-seeking-to-end-ukraine-war-by-may-9-foreign-minister-a77551"  target="_blank">reported</a>.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8220;We will solemnly celebrate May 9, as we always do,&#8221; Lavrov continued. &#8220;Remember those who fell for the liberation of Russia and other republics of the former U.S.S.R., for the liberation of Europe from the Nazi plague.&#8221;</p>
<p>World War II has shaped Putin&#8217;s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war; In justifying the invasion of Ukraine, he claimed he had set out to &#8220;denazify&#8221; the country&mdash;a phrase that many pundits noted is <a href="https://time.com/6154493/denazification-putin-ukraine-history-context/" >inaccurate</a> in this context given Ukraine has <a href="https://time.com/6154139/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-profile-russia/" >a Jewish President</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong></em><a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" ><em>World War II in Europe Ended 75 Years Ago&mdash;But the World Is Still Fighting Over Who Gets to Say What Happened</em></a></p>
<p>World War II has always been central to the Russian state&#8217;s approach to telling the country&#8217;s history. While the Allies marked May 7 as <a href="https://time.com/3845239/victory-day-may-11/" >&#8220;V-E Day&#8221;</a>&mdash;Victory in Europe Day&mdash;to commemorate the Nazis surrendering in Reims, France, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin wanted to wait to celebrate until the Nazis surrendered in Soviet-controlled Berlin the next day. By the time the text was signed late at night, it was already May 9 on Moscow time.</p>
<p>As TIME has previously reported, in the 1960s Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev made May 9 a national holiday, <a href="https://time.com/5832549/world-war-ii-memory/" >complete with military parades</a>. Russia&#8217;s first post-Soviet President Boris Yeltsin turned those into an annual tradition; under Putin, hundreds of thousands of spectators have gathered to watch military personnel march alongside tanks<a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1738768_1585965,00.html" > and missiles</a>. Billboards and buses have featured <a href="https://time.com/3852689/ussr-russia-victory-day-wwii-putin-ukraine/" >posters</a> of Stalin for Victory Day. Tens of millions of Russian citizens have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">marched</a> in Moscow carrying portraits of relatives who died in World War II. Ivan I. Kurilla, a professor at the European University of St. Petersburg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/europe/russia-immortal-regiment-parade-victory-day.html"  target="_blank">told</a> the New York <em>Times </em>in 2018 that acknowledgement of family sacrifices during the war &ldquo;is probably the only social glue to form a single society&rdquo; in Russia.</p>
<p>But scholars say that often lost in the Victory Day celebrations are hard truths about what Russia&#8217;s victory in the war really meant. &#8220;The Stalin regime was almost as criminal as the Hitler regime,&#8221; scholar Nikolay Koposov <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/webcast-victory-day-and-russias-politics-history"  target="_blank">stated</a> in a Wilson Center webcast in 2020, &#8220;and most Russians do not realize that the war was not for their freedoms but was largely a battle between the two dictators.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pundits in Russia have pointed out that Victory Day has also become about more than just celebrating Russia&#8217;s military achievements in the past; it&#8217;s very much about galvanizing support for Russia in the present and showing off the strength of Russia&#8217;s military forces.</p>
<p>Journalist Andrei Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a> in a 2017 article about the modern-day significance of Victory Day that it&#8217;s &#8220;central&#8221; to Putin&#8217;s view of Russian history, and &#8220;the Great Patriotic War&#8221; has become his nickname for World War II. &#8220;The current regime, which calls itself the sole heir of this victory, uses this achievement to make itself immune to criticism on other issues while justifying its current militarization efforts and excessive state interference in all aspects of life,&#8221; Kolesnikov <a href="https://carnegiemoscow.org/2017/10/05/past-that-divides-russia-s-new-official-history-pub-73304"  target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;In its official conception, Russia&rsquo;s commemoration of Victory Day in 1945 is only formally an occasion for collectively mourning for Russia&rsquo;s war dead. It has turned instead into an instrument for providing support to the most militarized, bellicose kind of Russian leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the walk-up to Victory Day this year, the United Nations <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/26/1094796253/ukraine-russia-refugees"  target="_blank">says</a> that the Russia-Ukraine war has displaced more than 5 million Ukrainians so far&mdash;and projects it will displace more than 8 million before it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalism is coming under increasingly intense pressure in Ukraine, exacerbated by the war, as press freedom remains restricted in well over two thirds of the world, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSF&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://rsf.org/en/index"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 World Press Freedom Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released on May 3, which measures access to information and curbs on journalistic freedoms, found that the situation for the press is &ldquo;very bad&rdquo; in 28 countries, &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; in 42 and &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; in 62. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those 132 countries represent just over 73% of the 180 nations surveyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia&rsquo;s February invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war is a threat to the future of Ukrainian media, which were already fairly restricted before the invasion due to an oligarch monopoly, according to RSF. Ukraine ranks 106 on the index of 180 countries, while Russia ranks 155. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In this &#8216;information war&#8217;, Ukraine stands at the front line of resistance against the expansion of the Kremlin&rsquo;s propaganda system,&rdquo; RSF said in its report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since February, journalists in Ukraine have been deliberately targeted by military fire, and the number of reporters killed has risen to at least 20, according to the </span><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/04/13/20-journalists-killed-in-ukraine-war-union-a77336"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moscow Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&rsquo;s government has blocked media carrying Kremlin-backed propaganda, while the Russian army has deliberately targeted journalists, media and infrastructure to prevent the Ukrainian population from having access to independent news and information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://time.com/6151572/russian-media-ukraine-coverage/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, journalism was already tightly controlled by the Kremlin before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, but some independent media outlets fought to challenge the state narrative. That changed on March 4, when President Vladimir Putin </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/russia-censorship-media-crackdown.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted a law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making sharing &ldquo;false information&rdquo; about the war punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Kremlin also blocked access to Facebook and foreign news outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clampdown forced independent media outlets&mdash;including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novaya Gazeta,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is led by </span><a href="https://time.com/6126259/nobel-peace-prize-dmitry-muratov/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;to cease publication. The Russian version of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euronews </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was suspended by the country&rsquo;s media regulator on March 22, and all privately-owned independent TV channels, except for cable entertainment channels, are banned from broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, Crimea and Donbass, the media are silenced and often replaced by Kremlin propaganda, according to RSF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, footage circulated on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1514339222118883334?s=20&amp;t=jOLWfK2xHUOYDvuT1m1_9A"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Margarita Simonyan, the Editor in Chief of Russian state broadcaster RT advocating for government censorship of the media. &ldquo;No great nation can exist without control over information,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global media polarization has increased two-fold over the past year, RSF found. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disparity between open societies and authoritarian regimes that censor negative media coverage and spread propaganda is fuelling geopolitical tensions. Leading up to and following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia </span><a href="https://time.com/6151578/russia-disinformation-ukraine-social-media/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">disseminated false information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to dupe Ukrainian forces, denounced foreign reports of war crimes as </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-denies-killing-civilians-ukraines-bucha-2022-04-03/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;fakes&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/15/1086705796/russian-propaganda-war-in-ukraine"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anti-war reporting back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The creation of media weaponry in authoritarian countries eliminates their citizens&rsquo; right to information but is also linked to the rise in international tension, which can lead to the worst kind of wars,&rdquo; RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The press freedom index highlighted that journalists in Afghanistan and Hong Kong have also come under increased constraints. The fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August last year radically altered Afghanistan&rsquo;s media landscape&mdash;within the space of three months, almost half of media outlets disappeared. At the end of last year, only four out of 10 journalists were still in their jobs, according to RSF. The country plunged to 156 on the index, in the worst category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Journalists and independent media all over the world are at risk right now,&rdquo; says </span><a href="https://time.com/collection/women-of-the-year/6150546/zahra-joya/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zahra Joya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Afghan journalist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who leads an independent platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to spotlight women&rsquo;s stories in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joya, who founded </span><a href="https://rukhshana.com/en/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rukhshana Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 and works with women journalists on the ground in the country, says many fear for their safety. &ldquo;They are working in extremely difficult situations because they are in hiding,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They are in serious danger, they could be tortured.&rdquo; The few that can work are forced by the Taliban to cover up and are completely separated from their male colleagues. In southern regions like Kandahar, Joya says there isn&rsquo;t a single woman journalist left working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSF found only 410 women journalists were still working in the country in December. The shift reflects a trend across the country as a whole, where four out of 5 women have lost their jobs compared to around half of men. J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oya, was forced to flee the country when she realized the danger posed to women journalists under Taliban rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If women are not represented in newsrooms, the Afghan media will fail half the country&rsquo;s population, Joya says. &ldquo;If women can&#8217;t be educated, and they can&rsquo;t have contact with the male journalists, they can&rsquo;t share their stories and experiences,&rdquo; Joya says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Taliban, who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were last in power from 1996 to 2001, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also control and review all media reports before they are released, to remove negative coverage. &ldquo;They haven&#8217;t changed. They are still the Taliban who they were in 1996,&rdquo; Joya says.</span></p>
<h2><b>National Security Law crackdown on Hong Kong journalists</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hong Kong, where independent journalism previously thrived, the local press has been restricted since the introduction of the </span><a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Security Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June 2020, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibits acts deemed to be treason, secession, sedition, and subversion against the Chinese government. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the silencing of prominent journalists and media outlets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong has fallen over a third of the way down RSF&rsquo;s index.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, two major independent news outlets, </span><a href="https://time.com/6074478/apple-daily-close-hong-kong/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Daily</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were forced to shut down after the government froze their assets, while numerous smaller-scale media outlets ceased operations due to the legal risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public broadcaster </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio Television Hong Kong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;once </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-57253030"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Hong Kong&rsquo;s version of the BBC&mdash;has been placed under a pro-government management, which has prevented programs featuring pro-democracy advocates from airing. Beijing-backed Hong Kong lawmakers have claimed the broadcaster is biased, and welcomed the sacking of editorial staff who criticized the regime. The platform has also been used to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promote </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-57253030"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing-led changes to electoral laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to RSF, journalists are a prime target of the National Security Law. Following on from the arrest of hundreds of journalists during the pro-democracy protests in 2019, a dozen more were detained last year. Earlier this month, a prominent journalist and former columnist of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allan Au was</span> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/prominent-hong-kong-journalist-allan-au-reportedly-held-on-sedition-charge"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for allegedly conspiring to publish &ldquo;seditious materials&rdquo;.</span></p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173536/economic-risk-climate-geography/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that global climate change <a href="https://time.com/6093845/how-heat-hurts-the-economy/" >hurts the economy</a>. With more frequent and more severe storms, flooding, drought, and fires, countries around the world are already taking economic hits. And as long-term events like rising sea levels and temperature patterns continue to affect agriculture and human health, the economic damage will only grow.</p>
<p>The impact, however, will be <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/ratings/research/101529900.pdf"  target="_blank">unequally distributed</a>. A recent report from <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/12/01/dominica-lost-almost-all-gdp-climate-change"  target="_blank">S&amp;P Global</a> assessed how 135 countries might be affected by climate-related events in 2050. The economic risk levels ranged from 0% of GDP (indicating that the economy will likely not be exposed to climate hazards) to 100% of GDP (the entire economy could be exposed to climate hazards). The measurement predicts only economic vulnerability&mdash;not economic loss. For example, a country with 80% GDP exposure doesn&rsquo;t mean that 80% of the economy will be wiped out in 30 years, but rather that 80% of the economy is <em>at risk</em> of experiencing a loss.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Using these percentages, TIME &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; countries on a blue-to-red scale to see which economies are in least and most danger. But instead of a standard map&mdash;one with, say, borders and oceans&mdash;we looked at each country as a latitudinal point. The result was a chart that looks a bit like a volcano turned sideways.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Share of country GDP exposed to climate impacts, by latitude" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4W5jT/5/#?secret=zhEmMHBlIn" data-secret="zhEmMHBlIn" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="540"></iframe></p>
<p>What this shows is that economies that have huge physical climate risk&mdash;in some cases 100% exposed&mdash;are generally within 20 degrees of the equator. And none are in the far northern or southern parts of the globe. On the other hand, countries that have minimal risk are from a wide range of latitudes, but skew more to the poles.</p>
<p>To arrive at these numbers, S&amp;P Global researchers considered how much of each country&rsquo;s area is prone to experience wildfires, storms, floods, and rising sea levels, as well as how much of agricultural land is at risk of water stress, and workforce population impacted by extreme heat.</p>
<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6171610/palau-marine-protected-area-climate-justice/" ><em>One Island Nation&#8217;s Controversial Plan to Take Climate Justice Into Its Own Hands</em></a></p>
<p>There are a few reasons why this geographic pattern exists. For one, a number of nations at or near Earth&rsquo;s waistline are small island states that are highly vulnerable to massive storms that can devastate infrastructure and crimp their most dependent industries, such as tourism. Additionally, a large share of countries located around the equator have less diversified economies that rely on physical labor to produce goods. Extreme heat can have devastating effects on labor productivity in these nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, higher-income and service-driven countries like Botswana and South Africa, which are at the tip of the continent, have 19% and 0% GDP exposure; low-income countries like Ethiopia and Burkina Faso that rely more on agriculture and industry and sit just above the equator, have 93% and 99% GDP exposure, respectively.</p>
<p>A separate element of the study looked at how prepared each country might be to adapt to climate impacts on a scale from 1 (most ready) to 6 (least ready). This score is not a factor in the GDP risk assessment, but it does serve to show how prepared each country might be to address those risks.</p>
<p>When TIME plotted this readiness assessment based on country latitude, the trends&mdash;particularly at the extreme ends of the readiness scale&mdash;were even more stark than GDP exposure. Among countries with the best readiness score, only the highly developed city-state of Singapore lies on the equator. And conversely, nearly all the countries with the worst readiness score are within 20 degrees of the equator.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Readiness to adapt to climate risks, by latitude" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/haM2n/4/#?secret=MBFr5XzCHw" data-secret="MBFr5XzCHw" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="546"></iframe></p>
<p>Taken together, the charts indicate that countries in northern and southern latitudes are more likely to have resources to prepare the best for climate effects&mdash;even though their economies are the least at risk. This is because these nations, particularly those on the European continent&mdash;have diversified and service-based economies that can take Mother Nature&rsquo;s punches. They are also wealthier and more technologically advanced, which allows them to funnel resources into climate adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>While S&amp;P Global didn&rsquo;t quantify GDP losses on a country level due to uncertainty surrounding the reliability of data at that level, it did calculate an estimate for global regions and the world. It found that 4% of the global economy could be lost to climate change impacts by 2050, assuming that countries stick to their current pledges to address climate change. As Marion Amiot, one of authors of the study, points out, a loss that small may not seem like a big deal, but it would be even worse than the 3.4% global GDP decline in 2020 due to COVID-19.</p>

<p><i>Read this story in </i><a href="https://time.com/6173104/lula-da-silva-transcricao/" ><strong><i>Portuguese</i></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/5946236/brazil-lula-returns/" >return to frontline politics</a> was a bombshell for Brazil. In April 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court annulled a series of corruption convictions that had excluded the leftist former President from national elections in 2018, saying a biased judge on his case had compromised his right to a fair trial. The decision set Brazil on course for a showdown between Lula&mdash;as he is universally known&mdash;and current far-right <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888329/jair-bolsonaro-brazil/" >President Jair Bolsonaro</a> in the October 2022 elections.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read the Cover Story: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6172611/brazil-president-lula-interview/" ><em>Brazil&rsquo;s Most Popular President Returns From Political Exile With a Promise to Save the Nation</em></a><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lula, who officially launches his campaign on May 7, promises to bring Brazil back to the good old days of his 2003-2010 presidency, which he wrapped with an 83% approval rating. That would mean reviving an ailing economy, saving a threatened democracy, and healing a nation scarred by the world&rsquo;s second-highest COVID-19 death toll and two years of chaotic pandemic mismanagement. So far, his<a href="https://time.com/6130308/bolsonaro-brazil-2022-election/" > promises are resonating</a>: Lula is <a href="https://www.uol.com.br/eleicoes/2022/04/22/pesquisa-ipespe-abril-2022-presidencia-lula-bolsonaro.htm"  target="_blank">polling</a> at 45% compared to Bolsonaro&rsquo;s 31%. But the gap is narrowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME staff writer Ciara Nugent <a href="https://time.com/6172611/brazil-president-lula-interview/" >sat down with Lula in late March</a>, in the S&atilde;o Paulo headquarters of his Workers&rsquo; Party (PT), to speak about his time in prison, the war in Ukraine, and whether his plans for the country are based on more than nostalgia. This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.</span></p>
<p><strong>TIME: When the Supreme Court restored your political rights last year, you were already preparing for a quieter life away from politics, according to Brazilian media. Did you immediately decide to return?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, I never gave up. Politics lives in every cell of my body, in my blood, in my head. Because the issue is not politics itself, but the cause that brings you to politics. And I have a cause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984864_1984866,00.html" >left the presidency in 2010</a>, I was not planning to be a presidential candidate again. But in the 12 years since I left office, I see that all the policies I created to benefit the poor&mdash;all our social inclusion policies, everything we did to improve universities, technical schools, improving salaries, improving the quality of jobs&mdash;all that was destroyed, dismantled. Because the people who started to occupy the government after the coup that took Dilma [Rousseff] out, were people who wanted to destroy all of the things that the Brazilian people had won after 1943. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an expectation that I would become President of Brazil, again, because people have good memories of the time when I was President. Because people had jobs. Because people had better wages, because they had wage increases above inflation. So I think people miss that, and they want those things improved.</span></p>
<p><b>Brazil is facing a very different situation today than when you won the presidency for the first time in 2002&mdash;in terms of the economy, political polarization, the international situation. Can you do as good a job as you did the first time?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In American football, there is a player. As it happens he&rsquo;s ended up with a Brazilian woman. A model. And he&rsquo;s been the best player in the world for a long time. In each game he&rsquo;s going to play, his fans demand that he plays better than he did in the last one. With the presidency it&rsquo;s the same thing</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am only running because I can do better than I did before.</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that I can resolve [Brazil&#8217;s] problems. I&#8217;m certain that our problems will only be solved when poor people are participating actively in the economy, when poor people participate in the budget, when poor people are working, when poor people can eat. That is only possible if you have a government that is dedicated to the poor.</p>
<p><b>Many people in Brazil say that there were many incarnations of Lula, particularly on economic policy. Which Lula do we have today? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, I am the only candidate with whom people should not be concerned about that. You know why? Because I&#8217;ve been a President twice already. And we don&#8217;t discuss economic policies before winning the elections. First, you have to win the elections. And then you have to know who you will have in your team and what you will do. But if you have questions about me, look at what happened in Brazil when I was President of the Republic. Look at how the market grew. Brazil was only doing [a few] IPOs. Under my government, we had 250. Brazil had a debt of $30 billion, and after my government, we started loaning money to the IMF. Brazil didn&rsquo;t have a single dollar of hard currency reserves. Today, we have $370 billion in hard currency reserves. [&#8230;] So you have to understand that instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I&#8217;ve done.</span></p>

<p><b>During your first presidency, oil, among other products, powered a lot of that economic success. Now, with the climate crisis, we&rsquo;re trying to use less oil. The front runner in Colombia&rsquo;s May election, Gustavo Petro, has <a href="https://time.com/6139508/gustavo-petro-anti-oil-bloc/" >proposed an anti-oil bloc</a>, in which countries would immediately stop exploration for oil. Would you join?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, Petro has the right to propose whatever he wants. But, in the case of Brazil, this is not for real. In the case of the world, it&rsquo;s not for real. We still need oil for a while, you can&rsquo;t just&hellip;</span></p>
<p><b>But the idea is to continue extracting and using the oil they&rsquo;ve already found, and stop exploring for new deposits. Would you consider that?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, as long as you don&rsquo;t have alternative energy, you will continue to use the energy that you have. Think of our dear Germany: Angela Merkel decided to close all the nuclear power plants. She did not count on the war in Ukraine. And today, Europe <a href="https://time.com/6153184/ukraine-crisis-scrambled-germanys-energy-politics/" >depends on Russia for energy</a>. What you can do is begin a long-term process to reduce [the need for oil] as you scale up other alternatives. You cannot imagine the United States stopping its use of oil from one day to the next. </span></p>
<p><b>I want to speak about the war in Ukraine. You have always prided yourself on being able to speak to everyone&mdash;Hugo Chavez as much as George Bush. But the world today is very fragmented diplomatically. I want to know if your approach still works. Could you speak to Vladimir Putin after what he&rsquo;s done in Ukraine?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We politicians reap what we sow. If I sow fraternity, solidarity, harmony, I&rsquo;ll reap good things. If I sow discord, I&rsquo;ll reap quarrels. Putin shouldn&#8217;t have invaded Ukraine. But it&rsquo;s not just Putin who is guilty. The U.S. and the E.U. are also guilty. What was the reason for the Ukraine invasion? NATO? Then the U.S. and Europe should have said: &ldquo;Ukraine won&rsquo;t join NATO.&rdquo; That would have solved the problem.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Alex Majoli&mdash;Magnum Photos</span><span class="caption" >Inside a shop in S&atilde;o Paulo in 2004, Lula is seen on television giving a speech responding to accusations of corruption against his government.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Do you think the threat of Ukraine joining NATO was Russia&rsquo;s real reason for invading?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the argument they put forward. If they have a secret one, we don&rsquo;t know. The other issue was Ukraine joining the E.U. The Europeans could have said: &ldquo;No, now is not the moment for Ukraine to join the E.U., we&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t have to encourage the confrontation.</span></p>
<p><b>But I think they did try to speak to Russia.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, they didn&rsquo;t. The conversations were very few. If you want peace, you have to have patience. They could have sat at a negotiating table for 10, 15, 20 days, a whole month, trying to find a solution. I think dialogue only works when it is taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><b>If you were President right now, what would you do? Would you have been able to avoid the conflict?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be able to. If I was President, I would have phoned <a href="https://time.com/6171813/biden-congress-billions-aid-ukraine/" >[Joe] Biden,</a> and Putin, </span><a href="https://time.com/6170974/olaf-scholz-germany-interview/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Germany,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and [Emmanuel] </span><a href="https://time.com/6170037/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-elections/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because war is not the solution. I think the problem is that if you don&rsquo;t try, you don&rsquo;t fix things. And you have to try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sometimes get worried. I was very concerned when the U.S. and the E.U.<a href="https://time.com/5518443/juan-guaido-interview-venezuela/" > adopted [Juan] Guaid&oacute;</a> [then leader of Venezuela&rsquo;s parliament] as President of the country [in 2019]. You don&rsquo;t play with democracy. For Guaid&oacute; to be President, he would have to be elected. Bureaucracy can&rsquo;t substitute politics. In politics, it&rsquo;s two heads of state who are governing, both elected by their people, who have to sit down at the negotiating table and look each other in the eye and talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now, sometimes I sit and watch the</span><a href="https://time.com/6171277/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President of Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians. This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war. Because in the war, there&rsquo;s not just one person guilty. Saddam Hussein was as guilty as Bush [for the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq war]. Because Saddam Hussein could have said, &ldquo;You can come here and check and I will prove that I do not have mass destruction weapons.&rdquo; But he lied to his people. And now, this President of Ukraine could have said, &ldquo;Come on, let&#8217;s stop talking about this NATO business, about joining the E.U. for a while.

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Luisa D&ouml;rr for TIME</span><span class="caption" >Lula, former Brazilian President and 2022 presidential candidate, photographed in S&atilde;o Paulo on March 23.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><b>So Volodomyr Zelensky should have talked to Putin more, even with 100,000 Russian troops at his border?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know the President of Ukraine. But his behavior is a bit weird. It seems like he&#8217;s part of the spectacle. He is on television morning, noon, and night. He is in the U.K. parliament, the German parliament, the French parliament, the Italian parliament, as if he were waging a political campaign. He should be at the negotiating table.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you really say that to Zelensky? He didn&rsquo;t want a war, it came to him.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did want war. If he didn&rsquo;t want war, he would have negotiated a little more. That&rsquo;s it. I criticized Putin when I was in Mexico City [in March], saying that it was a mistake to invade. But I don&rsquo;t think anyone is trying to help create peace. People are stimulating hate against Putin. That won&rsquo;t solve things! We need to reach an agreement. But people are encouraging [the war]. You are encouraging this guy [Zelensky], and then he thinks he is the cherry on your cake. We should be having a serious conversation: &ldquo;OK, you were <a href="https://time.com/5742108/ukraine-zelensky-interview-trump-putin-europe/" >a nice comedian</a>. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.&rdquo; And we should say to Putin: &ldquo;You have a lot of weapons, but you don&#8217;t need to use them on Ukraine. Let&rsquo;s talk!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><b>What do you think of Joe Biden?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I actually made a speech praising Biden when he announced his economic program. The problem is it&rsquo;s not enough to announce the program, you&rsquo;ve got to execute it. And I think Biden is going through <a href="https://time.com/6140442/joe-biden-presidency-second-year/" >a difficult moment</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I don&rsquo;t think he has taken the right decision on the war between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided [the war], not incited it. He could have talked more, participated more. Biden could have taken a plane to Moscow to talk to Putin. This is the kind of attitude you expect from a leader. To intervene so that things don&rsquo;t go off the rails. I don&rsquo;t think he did that.</span></p>
<p><b>Should Biden have made concessions to Putin?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. In the same way that the Americans persuaded the Russians <a href="https://time.com/5899754/jfk-decisionmaking-cuban-missile-crisis/" >not to put missiles in Cuba</a> in 1961, Biden could have said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to speak a bit more. We don&rsquo;t want Ukraine in NATO, full stop.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not a concession. Let me tell you something: if I were President of Brazil and they said to me, &ldquo;Brazil can join NATO,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say no.</span></p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I&rsquo;m a guy who only thinks about peace, not war. [&#8230;] Brazil doesn&rsquo;t have disputes with any country: not with the U.S., not China, nor Russia, nor Bolivia, nor Argentina, nor Mexico. And the fact that Brazil is a peaceful country will allow us to reestablish the relationships we created between 2003 and 2010. Brazil will once again become a protagonist on the world stage, because we will prove it&rsquo;s possible to have a better world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="time-diptyche-shortcode"></div></p>
<p><b>How will you do that?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to create a new global governance. Today&rsquo;s United Nations doesn&rsquo;t represent anything anymore. The U.N. isn&rsquo;t taken seriously by governments today, because each one makes decisions without respecting it. Putin invaded Ukraine unilaterally, without consulting the U.N. The U.S. is used to invading countries without asking anyone and without respecting the Security Council. So we need to rebuild the U.N., to include more countries and more people. If we do that, we can start to improve the world.</span></p>
<p><b>In Brazil, during the pandemic, the Black population had a higher risk of death than white people, and a higher unemployment rate because of the pandemic as well. And Brazil&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6047032/jair-bolsonaro-crime-policies-brazils-favelas/" >police-violence problem</a> has only worsened during the Bolsonaro government. What will you do to improve the world for <a href="https://time.com/5915902/brazil-racism-quilombos/" >Black Brazilians</a> specifically? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read a lot about slavery when I was in prison. And sometimes it&#8217;s difficult for me to understand what it means to have had 350 years of slavery. It&#8217;s difficult for me to understand that slavery is in people&#8217;s minds. And on the outskirts of Brazilian cities, we have thousands of young people dying almost every month, every year. It cannot continue. When I was President, we enacted a law to tell African history in Brazilian schools. So we would not see Africans as inferior people. So you know, we have to have this type of education at home and in schools. But Bolsonaro woke up hatred, prejudice. And there are other Presidents in Europe, in Hungary. A lot of fascists, Nazis, are popping up across the world.</span></p>
<div class="video-container"><div id="5gWwIETb" class="jw-video" data-media-id="test"></div></div>
<p><b>Is Bolsonaro to blame for racism in Brazil?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I wouldn&#8217;t say he is to blame for Brazil&#8217;s racism. It is chronic in Brazil. But he stimulates it.</span></p>

<p><b>You have gone through a lot of personal tragedies in the last five years. Has that changed you in any way?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. I would be lying if I told you I wasn&#8217;t wounded, that it didn&rsquo;t make me very nervous when the liars mounted this scheme to convict me. I was aware of what was happening in Brazil, I knew that the reason for Dilma&#8217;s impeachment had to continue. I mean, it made no sense to impeach Dilma, and two years later, I would be President again. So of course, they had to take me out of the game. But they had no reason. They cannot stop me from running for President. So what did they do? They set me up, they framed me using lies. To <a href="https://time.com/5840854/sergio-moro-brazil-interview/" >put me in jail</a>. Now I am free and all of my trials have been annulled. </span></p>
<p><b>Yes, the convictions have been annulled. But how did that period impact you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent 580 days in jail. I read a lot. I reflected a lot. I was prepared to leave prison without feeling any resentment, only remembering that it was a part of history. I cannot forget it. But I can&rsquo;t put it on the table every day. I want to think about the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For you to understand my life, I only ate bread for the first time when I was 7 years old. My mother, many times, didn&rsquo;t have anything to put on the stove for us. And I never saw her desperate. She always said: &ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll have enough. Tomorrow will be better.&rdquo; And that was ingrained in my consciousness, in my blood. That&rsquo;s how I am. There are no problems you can&rsquo;t overcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel proud to have proven that a metalworker without a university diploma is more competent to govern this country than the elite of Brazil. Because the art of government is to use your heart, not only your head.</span></p>
<p><b>You&rsquo;re getting married soon. Can you talk a bit about your fianc&eacute;e?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t like to talk about her. She can speak for herself. </span></p>
<p><b>Have you learned anything from her?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have. When you lose your wife, and you think, well, my life has no more meaning. Then suddenly, this person appears who makes you feel like you want to live again. I&rsquo;m in love as if I were 20 years old, as if it were my first girlfriend. I am going to get married in the most peaceful way possible, and I&rsquo;m going to run a happy campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A guy as happy as I am doesn&rsquo;t have to rage, doesn&#8217;t have to speak badly about his opponents&mdash;let them do what they want. If I can, on the campaign, I will speak only about love. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to be a good President if you only feel hate inside you, if all you want is revenge. No, you have to think about the future. The past is over. I will build a new Brazil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A volta de <a href="https://time.com/6172611/brazil-president-lula-interview/" >Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva &agrave; linha de frente da pol&iacute;tica</a> foi uma bomba para o Brasil. Em abril de 2021 o Supremo Tribunal Federal anulou uma s&eacute;rie de condena&ccedil;&otilde;es por corrup&ccedil;&atilde;o que exclu&iacute;ram o ex-presidente petista das elei&ccedil;&otilde;es presidenciais de 2018. O tribunal afirmou que a parcialidade do juiz respons&aacute;vel pelo caso comprometeu o direito de Lula &#8211; como o ex-presidente &eacute; mundialmente conhecido &#8211; a um julgamento justo. A decis&atilde;o </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparou o terreno para </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">um duelo entre Lula e o atual presidente de extrema-direita<a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888329/jair-bolsonaro-brazil/" > Jair Bolsonaro</a> nas elei&ccedil;&otilde;es de outubro de 2022.</span><br />

<p><em><strong>Read the Cover Story</strong>:</em> <a href="https://time.com/6172611/brazil-president-lula-interview/" ><em>Brazil&rsquo;s Most Popular President Returns From Political Exile With a Promise to Save the Nation</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lula, que <a href="https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2022/noticia/2022/04/11/pt-anuncia-que-lancara-oficialmente-pre-candidatura-de-lula-a-presidencia-em-maio.ghtml"  target="_blank">lan&ccedil;ar&aacute;</a> oficialmente sua pr&eacute;-candidatura no dia 7 de maio, promete levar o Brasil de volta aos bons tempos da sua Presid&ecirc;ncia (2003-2010), que ele encerrou com taxa de aprova&ccedil;&atilde;o de 83%. Isso implicaria reavivar uma economia debilitada, salvar <a href="https://time.com/6130308/bolsonaro-brazil-2022-election/" >uma democracia amea&ccedil;ada</a> e recuperar uma na&ccedil;&atilde;o marcada pela segunda maior taxa mundial de mortalidade ligada &agrave; Covid-19 e por dois anos de gest&atilde;o ca&oacute;tica da pandemia. At&eacute; o momento, as promessas est&atilde;o surtindo efeito: Lula aparece <a href="https://www.uol.com.br/eleicoes/2022/04/22/pesquisa-ipespe-abril-2022-presidencia-lula-bolsonaro.htm"  target="_blank">nas pesquisas</a> com 45% das inten&ccedil;&otilde;es de voto, contra 31% de Bolsonaro. Por&eacute;m, esta diferen&ccedil;a est&aacute; diminuindo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME sentou para conversar com Lula no fim de mar&ccedil;o, na sede do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) em S&atilde;o Paulo, para falar sobre o tempo que ele passou na pris&atilde;o, sobre a guerra na Ucr&acirc;nia e para saber se seus planos para o Brasil est&atilde;o baseados em algo al&eacute;m da nostalgia. Essa transcri&ccedil;&atilde;o foi condensada e editada para maior clareza.</span></p>
<p><strong>Quando o Supremo Tribunal Federal restaurou seus direitos pol&iacute;ticos no ano passado, voc&ecirc; j&aacute; estava, segundo a m&iacute;dia brasileira, se preparando para uma vida mais tranquila, fora da pol&iacute;tica. Voc&ecirc; decidiu imediatamente voltar &agrave; pol&iacute;tica quando isso aconteceu?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu na verdade nunca desisti da pol&iacute;tica. A pol&iacute;tica est&aacute; em cada c&eacute;lula minha, a pol&iacute;tica est&aacute; no meu sangue, est&aacute; na minha cabe&ccedil;a. Porque o problema n&atilde;o &eacute; a pol&iacute;tica simplesmente, o problema &eacute; a causa que te leva &agrave; pol&iacute;tica. E eu tenho uma causa.</span><b></b></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Luisa D&ouml;rr for TIME</span><span class="caption" >Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva gives a speech to union workers at Pra&ccedil;a Charles Muller, S&atilde;o Paulo, on International Workers&#8217; day, May 1, 2022.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quando <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984864_1984866,00.html" >deixei a Presid&ecirc;ncia em 2010</a>, efetivamente eu n&atilde;o pensava mais em ser candidato &agrave; Presid&ecirc;ncia da Rep&uacute;blica. Entretanto, o que eu estou vendo, doze anos depois, &eacute; que tudo aquilo que foi pol&iacute;tica para beneficiar o povo pobre&mdash; todas as pol&iacute;ticas de inclus&atilde;o social, o que n&oacute;s fizemos para melhorar a qualidade das universidades, das escolas t&eacute;cnicas, melhorar a qualidade do sal&aacute;rio, melhorar a qualidade do emprego&mdash;, tudo isso foi destru&iacute;do, desmontado. Porque as pessoas que come&ccedil;aram a ocupar o governo depois que deram o golpe na presidenta Dilma [Rousseff] eram pessoas que tinham o objetivo de destruir todas as conquistas que o povo brasileiro tinha obtido desde 1943.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> H&aacute; uma expectativa de que eu volte a presidir o pa&iacute;s porque as pessoas t&ecirc;m boas lembran&ccedil;as do tempo em que eu fui presidente. As pessoas trabalhavam, as pessoas tinham aumento de sal&aacute;rio, os reajustes salariais eram acima da infla&ccedil;&atilde;o. Ent&atilde;o eu penso que as pessoas t&ecirc;m saudades disso e as pessoas querem isso melhorado. </span></p>
<p><strong>A situa&ccedil;&atilde;o do Brasil hoje&mdash;a polariza&ccedil;&atilde;o pol&iacute;tica, a economia, o panorama internacional&mdash;&eacute; muito diferente do que quando voc&ecirc; ganhou a Presid&ecirc;ncia pela primeira vez. N&atilde;o vai ser mais dif&iacute;cil governar desta vez?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> O futebol americano tem um jogador, que ali&aacute;s &eacute; casado com uma brasileira que &eacute; modelo, e que &eacute; o melhor jogador do mundo h&aacute; muito tempo. A cada jogo que ele faz, a torcida fica exigindo que ele jogue melhor do que no jogo anterior. No caso da Presid&ecirc;ncia &eacute; a mesma coisa. S&oacute; tem sentido eu estar candidato &agrave; Presid&ecirc;ncia da rep&uacute;blica porque eu acredito que eu sou capaz de fazer mais e fazer melhor do que eu j&aacute; fiz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu tenho clareza de que eu posso resolver os problemas [do Brasil]. Eu tenho a certeza de que esses problemas s&oacute; ser&atilde;o resolvidos quando os pobres estiverem participando da economia, quando os pobres estiverem participando do or&ccedil;amento, quando os pobres estiverem trabalhando, quando os pobres estiverem comendo. Isso s&oacute; &eacute; poss&iacute;vel se voc&ecirc; tiver um governo que tenha compromisso com as pessoas mais pobres. </span></p>
<p><strong>Muitas pessoas no Brasil dizem que houve muitas encarna&ccedil;&otilde;es do Lula, especificamente em pol&iacute;tica econ&ocirc;mica. Qual Lula temos hoje?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu sou o &uacute;nico candidato com quem as pessoas n&atilde;o deveriam ter essa preocupa&ccedil;&atilde;o, porque eu j&aacute; fui presidente duas vezes. E a gente n&atilde;o discute pol&iacute;tica econ&ocirc;mica antes de ganhar as elei&ccedil;&otilde;es. Primeiro voc&ecirc; precisa ganhar para depois saber com quem voc&ecirc; vai compor e o que voc&ecirc; vai fazer. Quem tiver d&uacute;vida sobre mim olhe o que aconteceu nesse pa&iacute;s quando eu fui presidente da Rep&uacute;blica: o crescimento do mercado. O Brasil tinha dois IPOs. No meu governo fizemos 250 IPOs. O Brasil devia 30 bilh&otilde;es, o Brasil passou a ser credor do FMI, porque emprestamos 15 bilh&otilde;es. O Brasil n&atilde;o tinha um d&oacute;lar de reserva internacional, o Brasil tem hoje 370 bilh&otilde;es de d&oacute;lares de reserva internacional. [&#8230;] Ent&atilde;o as pessoas precisam ter em conta o seguinte: ao inv&eacute;s de perguntar o que &eacute; que eu vou fazer, olhe o que eu fiz.</span></p>

<p><strong>Na primeira Presid&ecirc;ncia, o petr&oacute;leo, entre outros produtos, impulsionaram muito esse sucesso. Agora, com a crise clim&aacute;tica, estamos tentando usar menos combust&iacute;veis f&oacute;sseis. O candidato &agrave; Presid&ecirc;ncia na Col&ocirc;mbia, Gustavo Petro, <a href="https://time.com/6139508/gustavo-petro-anti-oil-bloc/" >prop&ocirc;s um bloco antipetr&oacute;leo</a> em que os pa&iacute;ses deixariam imediatamente de explorar o petr&oacute;leo. Voc&ecirc; quer se unir a este bloco?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veja, eu acho que o Petro tem o direito de fazer todas as propostas que ele quiser fazer. Mas no caso do Brasil &eacute; irreal. No caso do mundo &eacute; irreal. Voc&ecirc; ainda precisa do petr&oacute;leo por um tempo, voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o consegue&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong>Por&eacute;m a ideia &eacute; continuar extraindo o petr&oacute;leo que j&aacute; descobriram, mas deixar de explorar. Voc&ecirc; quer deixar de explorar?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enquanto voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o tiver energia alternativa, voc&ecirc; vai utilizar a energia que voc&ecirc; tem. Isso vale para o Brasil e vale para o mundo inteiro. Veja a depend&ecirc;ncia da nossa querida Alemanha agora. Angela Merkel tomou a decis&atilde;o de fechar todas as usinas nucleares, n&atilde;o contava com a guerra da Ucr&acirc;nia. Hoje a Europa &eacute; muito <a href="https://time.com/6153184/ukraine-crisis-scrambled-germanys-energy-politics/" >dependente dos russos para poder ter energia.</a> O que voc&ecirc; pode estabelecer &eacute; um plano de longo prazo para voc&ecirc; diminuir [o consumo de petr&oacute;leo] na medida em que voc&ecirc; vai criando alternativas. N&atilde;o d&aacute; para imaginar que os Estados Unidos v&atilde;o parar de utilizar petr&oacute;leo do dia para a noite, ou qualquer pa&iacute;s.</span></p>
<p><strong>Quero falar da Ucr&acirc;nia. Voc&ecirc; sempre teve orgulho de poder falar com todos&mdash;Hugo Ch&aacute;vez e tamb&eacute;m George Bush. Mas o mundo de hoje &eacute; muito fragmentado diplomaticamente. Quero saber se sua abordagem na diplomacia ainda funciona. Voc&ecirc; poderia falar com Putin depois da<a href="https://time.com/6155129/russian-strategy-guiding-invasion-ukraine/" > invas&atilde;o da Ucr&acirc;nia</a>?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">N&oacute;s, pol&iacute;ticos, colhemos aquilo que n&oacute;s plantamos. Se eu planto fraternidade, solidariedade, conc&oacute;rdia, eu vou colher coisa boa. Mas se eu planto disc&oacute;rdia, eu vou colher desaven&ccedil;as. Putin n&atilde;o deveria ter invadido a Ucr&acirc;nia. Mas n&atilde;o &eacute; s&oacute; o Putin que &eacute; culpado, s&atilde;o culpados os Estados Unidos e &eacute; culpada a Uni&atilde;o Europeia. Qual &eacute; a raz&atilde;o da invas&atilde;o da Ucr&acirc;nia? &Eacute; a OTAN? Os Estados Unidos e a Europa poderiam ter dito: &#8216;A Ucr&acirc;nia n&atilde;o vai entrar na OTAN&#8217;. Estaria resolvido o problema.</span></p>

<p><strong>Voc&ecirc; acha que a OTAN foi a raz&atilde;o da R&uacute;ssia para invadir?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Esse &eacute; o argumento que est&aacute; colocado. Se tem um segredo n&oacute;s n&atilde;o sabemos. O outro &eacute; a [possibilidade de a] Ucr&acirc;nia entrar na Uni&atilde;o Europeia. Os europeus poderiam ter resolvido e dito: &#8216;N&atilde;o, n&atilde;o &eacute; o momento de a Ucr&acirc;nia entrar na Uni&atilde;o Europeia, vamos esperar&#8217;. Eles n&atilde;o precisariam fomentar o confronto! </span></p>
<p><strong>Mas acho que tentaram falar com a R&uacute;ssia. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">N&atilde;o tentaram. As conversas foram muito poucas. Se voc&ecirc; quer paz, voc&ecirc; tem que ter paci&ecirc;ncia. Eles poderiam ter sentado numa mesa de negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o e passado 10 dias, 15 dias, 20 dias, um m&ecirc;s discutindo para tentar encontrar a solu&ccedil;&atilde;o. Ent&atilde;o eu acho que o di&aacute;logo s&oacute; d&aacute; certo quando ele &eacute; levado a s&eacute;rio.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ent&atilde;o se voc&ecirc; fosse presidente neste momento, o que voc&ecirc; faria? Voc&ecirc; seria capaz de evitar o conflito?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu n&atilde;o sei se seria capaz. Eu, se fosse presidente hoje, teria ligado para o [Joe] <a href="https://time.com/6171813/biden-congress-billions-aid-ukraine/" >Biden</a>, teria ligado para o Putin, para <a href="https://time.com/6170974/olaf-scholz-germany-interview/" >a Alemanha</a>, para o [Emmanuel] <a href="https://time.com/6170037/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-elections/" >Macron</a>, porque a guerra n&atilde;o &eacute; sa&iacute;da. Eu acho que o problema &eacute; que, se a gente n&atilde;o tentar, a gente n&atilde;o resolve. &Eacute; preciso tentar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&Agrave;s vezes eu fico preocupado</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Eu fiquei muito preocupado quando os Estados Unidos e quando a Uni&atilde;o Europeia <a href="https://time.com/5518443/juan-guaido-interview-venezuela/" >adotaram o [Juan] Guaid&oacute;</a> [ent&atilde;o l&iacute;der da assembleia nacional da Venezuela] como presidente do pa&iacute;s [em 2019]. Voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o brinca com democracia. O Guaid&oacute; para ser presidente da Venezuela teria que ser eleito. A burocracia n&atilde;o substitui a pol&iacute;tica. Na pol&iacute;tica s&atilde;o os dois chefes que mandam, os dois que foram eleitos pelo povo, que t&ecirc;m que sentar numa mesa de negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o, olho no olho, e conversar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E agora, &agrave;s vezes fico vendo <a href="https://time.com/6171277/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war/" >o presidente da Ucr&acirc;nia</a> na televis&atilde;o como se estivesse festejando, sendo aplaudido em p&eacute; por todos os parlamentos, sabe? Esse cara &eacute; t&atilde;o respons&aacute;vel quanto o Putin. Ele &eacute; t&atilde;o respons&aacute;vel quanto o Putin. Porque numa guerra n&atilde;o tem apenas um culpado. O Saddam Hussein era t&atilde;o culpado quanto o Bush. Porque o Saddam Hussein poderia ter dito: &#8216;Pode vir aqui visitar e eu vou provar que eu n&atilde;o tenho armas&#8217;. Ele ficou mentindo para o seu povo. Agora, esse presidente da Ucr&acirc;nia poderia ter dito: &#8216;Olha, vamos deixar para discutir esse neg&oacute;cio da OTAN e esse neg&oacute;cio da Europa mais para frente. Vamos primeiro conversar um pouco mais.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><b>Ent&atilde;o Zelensky tinha que falar mais com Putin, mesmo com 100,000 soldados russos na sua fronteira?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu n&atilde;o conhe&ccedil;o o presidente da Ucr&acirc;nia. Agora, o comportamento dele &eacute; um comportamento um pouco esquisito, porque parece que ele faz parte de um espet&aacute;culo. Ou seja, ele aparece na televis&atilde;o de manh&atilde;, de tarde, de noite, aparece no parlamento ingl&ecirc;s, no parlamento alem&atilde;o, no parlamento franc&ecirc;s como se estivesse fazendo uma campanha. Era preciso que ele estivesse mais preocupado com a mesa de negocia&ccedil;&atilde;o. </span></p>
<p><strong>N&atilde;o seria um pouco dif&iacute;cil dizer isso a Zelensky? Ele n&atilde;o queria guerra, mas ela chegou.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ele quis a guerra. Se ele [n&atilde;o] quisesse a guerra, ele teria negociado um pouco mais. &Eacute; assim. Eu fiz uma cr&iacute;tica ao Putin quando estava na Cidade do M&eacute;xico, dizendo que foi errado invadir. Mas eu acho que ningu&eacute;m est&aacute; procurando contribuir para ter paz. As pessoas est&atilde;o estimulando o &oacute;dio contra o Putin. Isso n&atilde;o vai resolver! &Eacute; preciso estimular um acordo. Mas h&aacute; um est&iacute;mulo [ao confronto]! Voc&ecirc; fica estimulando o cara [Zelensky] e ele fica se achando o m&aacute;ximo. Ele fica se achando o rei da cocada, quando na verdade deveriam ter tido conversa mais s&eacute;ria com ele: &#8216;&Ocirc;, cara, voc&ecirc; &eacute; um bom artista, voc&ecirc; &eacute; <a href="https://time.com/5742108/ukraine-zelensky-interview-trump-putin-europe/" >um bom comediante</a>, mas n&atilde;o vamos fazer uma guerra para voc&ecirc; aparecer&#8217;. E dizer para o Putin: &#8216;&Ocirc;, Putin, voc&ecirc; tem muita arma, mas n&atilde;o precisa utilizar arma contra a Ucr&acirc;nia. Vamos conversar!&#8217;</span></p>
<p><strong> O que voc&ecirc; acha de Joe Biden?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu fiz at&eacute; um discurso elogioso ao Biden quando ele anunciou o primeiro programa econ&ocirc;mico dele. O problema &eacute; que n&atilde;o basta voc&ecirc; anunciar um programa, &eacute; preciso executar o programa. E eu acho que o Biden est&aacute; vivendo <a href="https://time.com/6140442/joe-biden-presidency-second-year/" >um momento dif&iacute;cil</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E acho que ele n&atilde;o tomou a decis&atilde;o correta nessa guerra R&uacute;ssia e Ucr&acirc;nia. Os Estados Unidos t&ecirc;m um peso muito grande e ele poderia evitar isso, e n&atilde;o estimular. Poderia ter falado mais, poderia ter participado mais, o Biden poderia ter pegado um avi&atilde;o e descido em Moscou para conversar com o Putin. &Eacute; esta atitude que se espera de um l&iacute;der. Que ele tenha interfer&ecirc;ncia para que as coisas n&atilde;o aconte&ccedil;am de forma atabalhoada. E eu acho que ele n&atilde;o fez. </span></p>
<p><strong>Biden deveria ter feito mais concess&otilde;es a Putin?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">N&atilde;o. Da mesma forma que os americanos convenceram os russos a <a href="https://time.com/5899754/jfk-decisionmaking-cuban-missile-crisis/" >n&atilde;o colocar m&iacute;sseis em Cuba</a> em 1961, o Biden poderia falar: &#8216;Vamos conversar um pouco mais. N&oacute;s n&atilde;o queremos a Ucr&acirc;nia na OTAN, ponto&#8217;. N&atilde;o &eacute; concess&atilde;o. Deixa eu lhe contar uma coisa: se eu fosse presidente da Rep&uacute;blica e me oferecessem &#8216;o Brasil pode entrar na OTAN&#8217;, eu n&atilde;o ia querer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Por qu&ecirc;?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porque eu sou um cara que s&oacute; pensa em paz. Eu n&atilde;o penso em guerra. [&#8230;] O Brasil n&atilde;o tem contencioso nem com os Estados Unidos, nem com a China, nem com a R&uacute;ssia, nem com a Bol&iacute;via, nem com a Argentina, nem com o M&eacute;xico. E &eacute; o fato de o Brasil ser um pa&iacute;s de paz que vai lhe fazer restabelecer a rela&ccedil;&atilde;o que n&oacute;s criamos de 2003 a 2010. O Brasil vai virar protagonista internacional, porque a gente vai provar que &eacute; poss&iacute;vel ter um mundo melhor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="time-diptyche-shortcode"></div></p>
<p><b>O que voc&ecirc; precisa fazer para conseguir isso?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&Eacute; urgente e &eacute; preciso a gente criar uma nova governan&ccedil;a mundial. A ONU de hoje n&atilde;o representa mais nada. A ONU de hoje n&atilde;o &eacute; levada a s&eacute;rio pelos governantes. Porque cada um toma decis&atilde;o sem respeitar a ONU. O Putin invadiu a Ucr&acirc;nia de forma unilateral, sem consultar a ONU. Os Estados Unidos costumam invadir os pa&iacute;ses sem conversar com ningu&eacute;m e sem respeitar o Conselho de Seguran&ccedil;a. Ent&atilde;o &eacute; preciso que a gente reconstrua a ONU, coloque mais pa&iacute;ses, envolva mais pessoas. Se a gente fizer isso, a gente come&ccedil;a a melhorar o mundo. </span></p>
<p><b>No Brasil, durante a pandemia, a popula&ccedil;&atilde;o negra sofreu um risco de mortalidade maior que os brancos, e uma taxa maior de desemprego tamb&eacute;m. E <a href="https://time.com/6047032/jair-bolsonaro-crime-policies-brazils-favelas/" >os problemas com a viol&ecirc;ncia policial</a> pioraram durante o governo do Bolsonaro. Voc&ecirc; tem coisas que vai fazer para melhorar o mundo para <a href="https://time.com/5915902/brazil-racism-quilombos/" >os brasileiros negros</a> especificamente?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olha, eu li muito sobre a escravid&atilde;o quando eu estava preso e eu &agrave;s vezes tenho dificuldade de compreender o que foram 350 anos de escravid&atilde;o. E eu tenho mais dificuldade de compreender que a escravid&atilde;o ela est&aacute; dentro da cabe&ccedil;a das pessoas, o preconceito est&aacute; dentro da cabe&ccedil;a das pessoas. Aqui no Brasil, na periferia brasileira, milhares de jovens s&atilde;o mortos quase todo m&ecirc;s, todo ano. Ent&atilde;o n&atilde;o &eacute; poss&iacute;vel isso continuar. Quando eu estava na presid&ecirc;ncia n&oacute;s criamos uma lei para que a hist&oacute;ria africana fosse contada na escola brasileira. Para que a gente aprendesse sobre a hist&oacute;ria africana para n&atilde;o ver os africanos como cidad&atilde;os inferiores. Ent&atilde;o n&oacute;s precisamos come&ccedil;ar essa educa&ccedil;&atilde;o dentro de casa, na escola. E o Bolsonaro despertou o &oacute;dio, despertou o preconceito. A&iacute; tem outros presidentes tamb&eacute;m na Europa, na Hungria, [que fazem o mesmo]; est&aacute; aparecendo muito fascista, muito nazista no mundo. </span></p>
<div class="video-container"><div id="5gWwIETb" class="jw-video" data-media-id="test"></div></div>
<p><strong>O Bolsonaro tem culpa pelo racismo hoje no Brasil ou &eacute; um pa&iacute;s racista?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu n&atilde;o diria que ele tem culpa pelo racismo porque o racismo &eacute; cr&ocirc;nico no Brasil. Mas ele estimula.</span></p>

<p><strong>Voc&ecirc; passou por muitas trag&eacute;dias pessoais nos &uacute;ltimos cinco anos. Isso mudou voc&ecirc; de alguma maneira?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">N&atilde;o. Eu confesso que se eu dissesse a voc&ecirc; que eu n&atilde;o fiquei magoado, que eu n&atilde;o fiquei muito nervoso com os mentirosos que montaram essa quadrilha para me condenar, eu estaria mentindo. Eu tinha consci&ecirc;ncia do que estava acontecendo no Brasil: o impeachment da Dilma n&atilde;o poderia terminar na Dilma, porque n&atilde;o tinha nenhum sentido fazer o impeachment da Dilma e dois anos depois o Lula voltar a ser presidente da Rep&uacute;blica. Ent&atilde;o era preciso afastar o Lula. E como eles n&atilde;o tinham como afastar, eles resolveram construir um ros&aacute;rio de mentiras contra mim para poder <a href="https://time.com/5840854/sergio-moro-brazil-interview/" >me colocar na cadeia</a>. Hoje eu estou aqui, livre, todos os meus processos foram anulados. </span></p>
<p><b>Sim, as condena&ccedil;&otilde;es foram anuladas. Mas como te impactaram? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu fiquei 580 dias na cadeia. Eu li muito. Ent&atilde;o eu fiz muita reflex&atilde;o, eu me preparei para sair da cadeia sem &oacute;dio, sem m&aacute;goa, sem ressentimento, apenas lembrando que aquilo foi um processo hist&oacute;rico que eu n&atilde;o posso esquecer. Eu n&atilde;o posso esquecer, mas eu n&atilde;o posso colocar na mesa esse assunto todo dia porque &eacute; uma coisa do passado. Eu quero pensar no futuro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Para voc&ecirc; entender a minha vida, eu fui comer p&atilde;o pela primeira vez com sete anos de idade. A minha m&atilde;e, muitas vezes, n&atilde;o tinha nada para colocar no fog&atilde;o para fazer comida para a gente. E eu nunca vi minha m&atilde;e desesperada. Ela sempre falava o seguinte: &#8216;Amanh&atilde; vai ter. Amanh&atilde; vai melhorar&#8217;. E isso foi introjetado na minha consci&ecirc;ncia, no meu sangue, e eu sou assim. N&atilde;o tem problema que a gente n&atilde;o consiga vencer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu tenho orgulho de provar que um metal&uacute;rgico que n&atilde;o tem diploma universit&aacute;rio tem mais compet&ecirc;ncia para governar esse pa&iacute;s do que a elite brasileira toda. Porque a arte de governar &eacute; voc&ecirc; saber utilizar o cora&ccedil;&atilde;o junto com a raz&atilde;o. </span></p>
<p><b>Voc&ecirc; vai se casar em breve. Voc&ecirc; quer falar um pouco sobre sua noiva?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu n&atilde;o gosto de falar dela. Porque ela tem autonomia para falar dela. </span></p>
<p><b>Voc&ecirc; aprendeu alguma coisa com ela?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eu aprendi. Eu aprendi que quando voc&ecirc; perde a tua mulher e voc&ecirc; pensa que a vida n&atilde;o tem mais sentido, quando voc&ecirc; pensa que tudo acabou, aparece uma pessoa que come&ccedil;a a dar sentido &agrave; vida outra vez. Estou apaixonado como se eu tivesse 20 anos de idade, como se fosse minha primeira namorada. Vou casar da forma mais tranquila poss&iacute;vel e vou fazer a campanha feliz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ent&atilde;o, um cara que est&aacute; feliz como eu n&atilde;o tem que ter outra preocupa&ccedil;&atilde;o. N&atilde;o tem que ter raiva, n&atilde;o tem que falar mal dos advers&aacute;rios. Deixa os advers&aacute;rios fazerem o que eles quiserem. Brigar, xingar. Eu, sinceramente, se puder fa&ccedil;o uma campanha falando de amor. Eu n&atilde;o acho que seja poss&iacute;vel voc&ecirc; ser um bom presidente se voc&ecirc; s&oacute; tem &oacute;dio dentro de voc&ecirc;, se voc&ecirc; s&oacute; tem vingan&ccedil;a dentro de voc&ecirc;. N&atilde;o. Voc&ecirc; tem que ter paz e pensar no futuro. O que passou, passou. Eu vou construir um novo Brasil.</span></p>
