<p>LOS ANGELES &mdash; The man arrested on suspicion of tackling comedian Dave Chappelle during a performance at the Hollywood Bowl will not be charged with any felonies, the district attorney&#8217;s office said Thursday.</p>
<p>Isaiah Lee, 23, was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, police said, after rushing the stage toward the end of Chappelle&#8217;s set in the last of a four-night stint at the outdoor amphitheater as part of the &ldquo;Netflix Is a Joke&rdquo; festival.</p>
<p>He was carrying a replica handgun with a large blade that folded out of it similar to a pocket knife, according to a photo released by police.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;After reviewing the evidence, prosecutors determined that while criminal conduct occurred, the evidence as presented did not constitute felony conduct,&rdquo; the Los Angeles County district attorney&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>The case has been referred to the Los Angeles city attorney&#8217;s office, which prosecutes misdemeanors within the city. An email seeking comment from the office was not immediately returned.</p>
<p>Jail records showed Lee was still being held Thursday in lieu of $30,000 bail, Mendez said. It was not immediately known if he had retained a lawyer, and the motive for the attack was unclear.</p>
<p>People standing in the wings of the stage, including actor Jamie Foxx and rapper Busta Rhymes, rushed on to the stage to try to help Chappelle.</p>
<p>Security guards chased and overpowered Lee, who was taken away in an ambulance for treatment of an unspecified injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The performances by Chappelle at the Hollywood Bowl were epic and record-breaking and he refuses to allow last night&rsquo;s incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment,&#8221; Chapelle&#8217;s publicist Carla Sims said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chappelle was attacked as he was wrapping up a routine in which he talked about how comedians have to worry more about their personal security in the wake of this year&#8217;s Academy Awards ceremony where the Oscar-winning actor slapped Chris Rock on live television in reaction to a joke about his wife.</p>
<p>Rock was also in the wings of Chappelle&#8217;s show, He grabbed the mic and jokingly asked, &ldquo;Was that Will Smith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puzzles saved my sanity during the pandemic&mdash;and I believe they can save the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps that sounds like a rationalization from a puzzle addict trying to justify the thousands of hours I&rsquo;ve spent wrestling with crosswords, logic problems, jigsaws and other forms of delightful mental sadism.</p>
<p>And sure, that&rsquo;s a part of it.</p>
<p>But after spending the last three years doing a deep dive into the science and history of puzzles, and after interviewing dozens of researchers and psychologists, I&rsquo;ve come to believe it strongly: Puzzles are not a waste of time. They are not a frivolous addiction. You don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty for your daily Wordle habit or for skipping the gym to go to an escape room.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>On the contrary, puzzles are a crucial tool that train us how to solve life&rsquo;s problems, from minor personal issues to the world crises. The little puzzles help us solve life&rsquo;s big puzzles.</p>
<p>The secret is what I call the Puzzler Mindset. This is the mindset you need to be a good puzzle solver, and it&rsquo;s a mindset that, I find, spills over into life outside of puzzles. The hallmarks of the Puzzler Mindset include being deeply curious, solution-oriented, rigorous, cognitively flexible, and good at taking other people&rsquo;s perspectives.</p>
<p>I started that list with &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; for a reason. It&rsquo;s the most crucial attribute shared by almost every puzzler I&rsquo;ve met. They all have an almost obsessive desire to figure stuff out, to solve problems. It&rsquo;s why one puzzle-solving motto is &ldquo;get curious, not furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anger is often a hindrance to puzzle-solving. I know this too well. I&rsquo;ve thrown Rubik&rsquo;s cube-type puzzles across the room. I&rsquo;ve pounded the desk while doing devious British crosswords. But angrier you get, the less likely you are to solve the puzzle. Research shows that anger negatively affects your <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/09/how-anger-poisons-decision-making"  target="_blank">decision-making</a>.</p>
<p>In real life, there&#8217;s plenty to be justifiably angry about and outrage can be a powerful motivating force, but when I can, I try to counterbalance my anger with curiosity. Consider one of the most exasperating real-life puzzles: Why do people have such divergent beliefs? When I&rsquo;m talking to someone on the other side of the political spectrum, I try to frame the discussion as a puzzle, not a war of words. What do we really disagree on? Why do we believe what we believe? What evidence can she provide that might change my mind? And what can I provide that might change hers? It&rsquo;s a mystery we can solve only by working together.</p>
<p>Research shows this puzzle-solving approach might be the best way to actually evolve our views. One promising technique&mdash; called <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/29/21065620/broockman-kalla-deep-canvassing"  target="_blank">deep canvassing&mdash;</a>focuses on the participants asking the puzzling question: Why do we believe what we believe?</p>
<p>This brings up another advantage of the Puzzle Mindset: It brings people together.</p>
<p>Consider the escape rooms. These popular games can only be solved when you cooperate with teammates, each focusing on your strengths. This quote sounds like I created it to support my pro-puzzle agenda, but it&rsquo;s actually from a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336374954_Escape_Rooms_for_Learning_A_Systematic_Review"  target="_blank">meta-analysis of sixty-eight peer-reviewed</a> studies by real scientists: Escape rooms &ldquo;strengthen social relationships, activate team spirit, and facilitate benefits of deep learning through group discussion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Harvard law professor and behavioral economist Cass Sunstein echoes this finding. He studied methods that would bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives. He found that one of the only activities that brought them together was jointly solving a crossword puzzles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only evidence that the Puzzle Mindset makes us less tribal. Harvard Psychology professor Joshua Greene conducted an experiment where he gave logic puzzles to one group of people, but not the control group. He then asked the subjects questions about moral quandaries.</p>
<p>The subjects who did puzzles answered in a more selfless way, more likely to place the good of society over themselves or their political tribe. This is because puzzles train us to be more rigorous thinkers, less swayed by atavistic emotions. Puzzles can change the way you see the world.</p>
<p>With the Puzzle Mindset, you become more solution oriented. You want to fix things instead of wallowing in despair. Even the framing of a real-life problem can make a difference. If I hear about the &ldquo;climate crisis,&rdquo; I want to curl up into a fetal position in the corner. If I hear about the &ldquo;climate puzzle,&rdquo; I want to roll up my sleeves and try to solve it.</p>
<p>Puzzlers show amazing grit when tackling problems. One of my favorite puzzles is called Kryptos. It&rsquo;s a sculpture located at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and it contains a baffling cipher of 1,800 letters that has yet to be solved, even by the CIA itself. I&rsquo;m on an email list of thousands of solvers who, every day, propose another theory. Maybe the key is Dante&rsquo;s inferno? Maybe it&rsquo;s Druidic runes?</p>
<p>These people have been at it ever since Kryptos was unveiled over thirty years ago. Now that&rsquo;s persistence! When I&rsquo;m helping my son with math homework and I want to give up after two minutes, I try to remember my Kryptos friends.</p>
<p>One reason these folks haven&rsquo;t given up on Kryptos is because puzzlers are okay with being wrong. The best puzzlers are always looking to disprove their hypothesis. It&rsquo;s why I use a pencil when doing crosswords. If you fall in love with a wrong solution, you&rsquo;ll never succeed. You need maximum cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>This is, of course, lacking in so much public discourse, where we are ruled by motivated reasoning, where changing your mind is seen as a mark of shame. The best puzzlers and scientists take the opposite approach. As Nobel-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman says, &#8220;being wrong is the only way I feel sure I learned anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>And finally, the Puzzler Mindset encourages us to see the world from different perspectives. It&rsquo;s a key strategy in solving puzzles. One of the most famous&mdash;and difficult&mdash;<a href="https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"  target="_blank">logic puzzles ever</a> created centers on an island with blue-eyed, green-eyed and brown-eyed people. The only way to solve this puzzle is to adopt the perspective of the islanders. You have to switch between the perspectives of the green-eyed castaway, the brown-eyed castaway, and the blue-eyed castaway.</p>
<p>You have to consider what each islander knows, and&mdash;even more important&mdash;what they know the other islanders know. This type of thinking is crucial to Game Theory, and is referred to as &ldquo;Common Knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It requires you to step into another person&rsquo;s shoes. Or several people&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve found this mental exercise trains me to see the world from other points of view, which is a crucial skill in these high tribal times.</p>
<p>The meta-puzzle is: How do we get more people to adopt the Puzzle Mindset. Well, for starters, why not do more puzzles?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only been about six months since the Omicron variant emerged and changed the landscape of the pandemic, sending case-counts soaring and <a href="https://time.com/6130704/breakthrough-infections-omicron/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing breakthrough infections</a> even among those who were fully vaccinated and boosted. The virus continues to keep scientists guessing, mutating into subvariants almost as fast as researchers can assign them names.</p>
<p>First there was BA.2, which <a href="https://time.com/6160259/ba2-covid-19-surge/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">became dominant in the U.S. earlier this spring</a>. Now, another Omicron descendent known as BA.2.12.1 is accounting for a growing share of U.S. cases&mdash;about 36% of samples sequenced during the week ending April 30, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Dd9662f7962b53ddf37a666ba072afa872c14b92e4fd373d73c8ad999805aed7d6d6525210ebcdbf7878121e723f22b5063f101be3d557c19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qPqX7JkgOCJs2TW5IeTsP" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). Overall, average daily diagnoses have roughly doubled nationwide since early April.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Two other Omicron spinoffs, known as BA.4 and BA.5, are also currently spreading in South Africa, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/who-tracks-omicron-bapoint4-and-bapoint5-subvariants-as-they-spread-through-africa-and-europe.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">where they were first identified</a>, and have been detected in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>It always takes time to learn how significant the emergence of new variants will be. Early data suggest the new Omicron relatives spread faster than BA.2, but they do not seem to cause more severe disease, the World Health Organization wrote in <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---27-april-2022"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Df240b5f624f994c84cd3dc19e063c5f89e494e7b503c1b20067d53e92c8b36652f1d3002773b5294486f897a2941c81d007257f821ddb471&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3O--oDF2ibBnqWaCO7M1oO" target="_blank">a report published April 27</a>. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently gave <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-05-03/cdc-new-omicron-subvariant-b-2-12-1-responsible-for-a-third-of-new-coronavirus-cases"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Df240b5f624f994c872ebc399f3ebe4b5e99b0d9e75dfeb4c2da028fbed343a1c46902d09dec9275da4b7fee010179736ae903016f9e2fc59&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw013CKMwxkpOESDMy_VFgl2" target="_blank">a similarly reassuring message to reporters</a>, saying that&mdash;though more research is needed&mdash;&ldquo;we continue to believe that those who are vaccinated, and especially those who are boosted, continue to have strong protection against severe disease, even from BA.2.12.1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, a pair of preliminary, not-yet-peer-reviewed studies&mdash;<a href="https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1611421/v1_covered.pdf?c=1651516226"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Df240b5f624f994c8925a1c88079cc57587b04fd5670ed07a5056bbc8f4784dce53e32f876634129d3c579a193fb04b8b7c414fc30aefd28a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw28sleWBIeZvLrV1ECfT8Do" target="_blank">one from China</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274477v1"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Df240b5f624f994c88537b61db1b69581bd375efdf5365bf41188a8febd1eabc1ab0275e99294a1c96bfd702bd100751974b81d7eebf93749&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Dfkjvl7rQR0jesKD4_hon" target="_blank">one from South Africa</a>&mdash;suggest these newer Omicron subvariants are better than earlier strains at evading the <a href="https://time.com/6171943/how-long-does-covid-immunity-last/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">immunity offered by vaccines and prior infections</a>. That means even people who caught the original Omicron strain could be at risk of reinfection&mdash;but, as former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1521867804521103360"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.newsletters.time.com/?qs%3Df240b5f624f994c8f3a15f06921dcbe100a3df6ba18e05eba7f63b5b86243248413d51c6bbc79b9d7ccea8921fa1f4bafe7ce1469a412bfd&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651860991701000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0JRnygTNObe-qv6XvZSlsA" target="_blank">tweeted yesterday</a>, those who are fully vaccinated <em>and </em>recently had COVID-19 seem to have stronger protection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that the virus continues to mutate; scientists have long predicted that would be the case. But as BA.2.12.1 works its way around the U.S., it should be a reminder that the pandemic is full of twists and turns. Everything we know about the virus and immunity to it can change. All it takes is a new variant.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; President Joe Biden on Thursday named Karine Jean-Pierre to be the next White House press secretary, with incumbent Jen Psaki set to leave the role next week.</p>
<p>Biden is also bringing back longtime Democratic strategist Anita Dunn as his senior adviser. She had served in the Biden White House last year for several months after Biden was sworn into office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karine not only brings the experience, talent and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris Administration on behalf of the American people,&#8221; Biden said in a statement praising Jean-Pierre, who has served as Biden&#8217;s principal deputy press secretary since Inauguration Day.</p>

<p>Psaki, who leaves the White House on May 13, praised her successor, noting the significance of the history-making appointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be the first black woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as the White House Press Secretary,&rdquo; Psaki said. &ldquo;Representation matters and she will give a voice to many, but also make many dream big about what is truly possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following through on a campaign promise, the Biden administration on Thursday announced a wide-ranging enforcement strategy aimed at holding industrial polluters accountable for damage done to poor and minority communities.</p>
<p>The strategy includes creation of an Office of Environmental Justice within the Justice Department to focus on <a href="https://time.com/6017907/climate-emergency-racial-justice/" >&ldquo;fenceline communities&rdquo;</a> that have been exposed to air and water pollution from chemical plants, refineries and other industrial sites.</p>
<p>The plan also reinstates a dormant program that allowed fines paid by industry as part of a settlement go to community activities such as river cleanup, health clinics or other programs that benefit the environment or public health. The program was used by presidents from both parties before being eliminated in the Trump administration.<br />

<p>&ldquo;Although violations of our environmental laws can happen anywhere, communities of color, indigenous communities and low-income communities often bear the brunt of the harm caused by environmental crime, pollution and climate change,&rsquo;&rsquo; Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for far too long, these communities have faced barriers to accessing the justice they deserve,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No American should have to live, work or send their kids to school in a neighborhood that carries an unfair share of environmental hazards,&#8221; added Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden had promised during the 2020 campaign that he would establish an <a href="https://time.com/5864704/environmental-racism-climate-change/" >environmental justice</a> division within the Justice Department and <a href="https://joebiden.com/environmental-justice-plan/"  target="_blank">elevate environmental justice issues</a> in an all-of-government approach.</p>
<p>In a related development, the White House announced Thursday that advocate Jalonne White-Newsome will lead environmental justice efforts at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. White-Newsome succeeds Cecilia Martinez, who stepped down in January.</p>
<p>White-Newsome, of Michigan, is founder and CEO of Empowering a Green Environment and Economy, a consulting firm focused on <a href="https://time.com/section/climate/" >climate change</a>, public health and environmental and racial equity.</p>
<p>CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory called White-Newsome &ldquo;a strong and effective champion for communities that have been overburdened by pollution and subjected to decades of environmental injustice.&#8221; Her ability to &#8220;listen deeply, bring people together and find creative solutions will be invaluable,&#8221; Mallory said.</p>
<p>On enforcement, the strategy unveiled Thursday is intended to guide the work of employees throughout the Justice Department, including U.S. attorneys across the country who will begin a renewed focus on environmental justice issues, Garland and Gupta said.</p>
<p>The new office &ldquo;will prioritize meaningful and constructive engagement with the communities most affected by environmental crime and injustice,&#8221; Garland said. &ldquo;Whenever possible, these efforts will respond directly to community needs and concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Environmental Protection Agency head Michael Regan said the &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; between his agency and the Justice Department &ldquo;has never been stronger&rdquo; and will ensure that the federal government does all it can &#8220;to protect overburdened and underserved communities across America.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strategy follows a series of enforcement actions announced by Regan in January to address air pollution, unsafe drinking water and other problems afflicting minority communities in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states that Regan toured in November.</p>
<p>The plan includes unannounced inspections of chemical plants, refineries and other industrial sites and installation of air monitoring equipment in Louisiana&rsquo;s &ldquo;chemical corridor&rdquo; to enhance enforcement at a series of chemical and plastics plants between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The region contains several hotspots where cancer risks are far above national levels.</p>
<p>EPA also issued a notice to the city of Jackson, Mississippi, saying its aging and overwhelmed drinking water system violates the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The agency also said it would move forward on clean up creosote contamination from a site in Houston now owned by Union Pacific Railroad. The site has been linked to higher than normal cancer rates in the historically Black neighborhood in the city&#8217;s Fifth Ward.</p>
<p>Regan has made environmental justice a priority since taking the helm at EPA in March 2021. The weeklong &ldquo;Journey to Justice&rdquo; tour in November was intended to highlight areas in the American South that have long been marginalized and overburdened by pollution.</p>
<p>Biden requested $1.4 million for the environmental justice in his budget proposal. Cynthia Ferguson, an attorney in the department&#8217;s Environment and Natural Resources Division will serve as acting director. The office will support environmental justice investigations and litigation and work with communities across the country with environmental justice concerns, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>A rule being published in the Federal Register will restore the department&rsquo;s ability to use Supplemental Environmental Projects, or SEPs, as part of settlements with corporate or industrial polluters. The projects are intended to bring environmental and public health benefits to communities directly affected by the underlying violations.</p>
<p>A 2007 settlement with Texas-based energy company Valero included a $4.25 million penalty and $232 million in pollution controls at refineries in Tennessee, Ohio and Texas. The company was required to spend at least $1 million to enhance efforts by a health center Port Arthur, Texas to diagnosis and treat asthma and other respiratory problems.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than two dozen states are </span><a href="https://time.com/6173196/abortion-trigger-laws-bans-roe-v-wade/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">poised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban abortions if the Supreme Court overturns </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then there&rsquo;s Wisconsin, where a politically divided government, a hotly contested election season, and a 173-year-old law that criminalizes nearly all abortions are making for a potentially chaotic post-Roe landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prospect of a restoration of the 1849 statute has upended the midwestern swing state. Wisconsin&rsquo;s attorney general, a Democrat, has vowed to not enforce it but can&rsquo;t stop local officials from doing so. And while Democratic Gov. Tony Evers supports repealing the law, Republicans control the state legislature, where such efforts will go nowhere. On the flip side, GOP lawmakers are unable to further restrict abortions in the state because of Evers&rsquo; veto power. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a reality that is quickly reshaping Wisconsin&#8217;s already competitive races for governor, attorney general, and the U.S. Senate ahead of the Aug. 9 primaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This has changed Wisconsin politics in the snap of a finger,&rdquo; says Mordechai Lee, an urban planning professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, and a former member of the state assembly and state senate. &ldquo;The fall election is going to be a referendum on abortion.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin is one of 10 states with a pre-existing law to ban abortion. All such laws were nullified after the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling granting a constitutional right to an abortion. But if the court strikes down that ruling this summer&mdash;as a leaked draft, first </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Politico, suggested it would&mdash;those laws will automatically be reinstated. Thirteen red states also have so-called trigger laws that would immediately outlaw or curtail abortion rights if such a ruling is issued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wisconsin law is notably stringent. It </span><a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/with-abortion-ban-likely-wisconsins-midterm-elections-already-taking-on-a-new-form/article_b7b9c3eb-33c5-5029-9dda-72eb5232af98.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performing or assisting in any abortion as a Class H felony, punishable by up to six years in prison. The consequences are even more severe for the termination of an &ldquo;unborn quick child,&rdquo; i.e. a fetus that can move in the womb&mdash;a Class E felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The law only allows for abortions when the health of the mother is at risk. It does not include any exemptions for victims of rape or incest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&rsquo;t take long after the draft opinion leaked for the battle lines to emerge in the Badger State. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Josh Kaul, Wisconsin&rsquo;s top law enforcement official, has said his office </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/attorney-general-josh-kaul-questions-enforceability-173-year-old-abortion-ban"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not enforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 19th Century law, and urged local officials not to do so either. His leading Republican challenger has said </span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/04/attorney-general-candidate-eric-toney-would-enforce-abortion-ban/9645887002/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he would enforce it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a similar dynamic in the governor&rsquo;s race, where the winner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would largely determine whether Republicans can impose even stricter restrictions on abortions once <em>Roe</em> is tossed out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evers, 70, currently serves as the only defense against the legislature beefing up restrictions on abortion access. Last year, he </span><a href="https://madison.com/gov-tony-evers-vetoes-wisconsin-gop-abortion-bills/article_e3ab4e54-5477-11ec-8d1d-87c6115a22b2.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed five such bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were sent to his desk. He is also leading a coalition of 17 governors </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1521584784169963521"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Congress to pass a nationwide right to abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidates for governor made clear this week that they would support enforcement of the 1849 law if elected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The left wants to enforce mob rule and further degrade law and order in Wisconsin,&rdquo; says Kevin Nicholson, one of the leading GOP candidates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Wisconsin needs new leadership&mdash;leaders that will follow the law and protect innocent life.&rdquo; Another candidate, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, celebrated the leaked ruling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time!&rdquo; she </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RebeccaforReal/status/1521297160884527104"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close Madison watchers suspect that a Republican in the governor&rsquo;s mansion would support the legislature passing even tighter restrictions to update the pre-Civil War law, such as adding language to prohibit the use of abortion pills. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a murky area of the law that they may want to address,&rdquo; says David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&#8217;s the way it comes into play the governor&#8217;s race&mdash;stopping any additional legislation that would make access to abortions even more difficult,&rdquo; Canon added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbc15.com/2022/05/03/mu-polls-wisconsin-shows/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 60 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Wisconsinites support legalized abortion, according to polling conducted by the Marquette Law School over the last 10 years. And the conventional wisdom has already formed that the overturning of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">would energize key Democratic constituencies, particularly women and young people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin GOP strategists, however, insisted that the electorate would care more about the economy than access to reproductive care. &ldquo;It will energize the Democratic base in the short term, but in the long term, people are still going to vote on pocketbook issues: inflation, gas prices, food prices, immigration and crime,&rdquo; says Bill McCoshen, who served as chief of staff to former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If <em>Roe</em> is overturned, Lee predicted that the media would be looking for &ldquo;case number one &mdash; a woman who wanted to get an abortion but couldn&#8217;t afford to go to Chicago or Minnesota and has to have the kid.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen before November, but I don&#8217;t think voters will need to see a prosecution to feel strongly about the issue,&rdquo; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leaked draft opinion may also become a galvanizing force in the U.S. Senate race, where the Republican incumbent, Ron Johnson, is up for reelection. On Wednesday, he </span><a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/american-bridge-ron-johnson-wants-almost-all-abortions-illegal-in-wisconsin/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the draft&rsquo;s contents represented the &ldquo;correct decision.&rdquo; The three leading Democrats running to unseat him have vowed to support codifying a right to abortion into federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those Democrats, Sarah Godlewski, is currently Wisconsin&rsquo;s state treasurer, an elected position. She was visiting Washington, D.C., this week for a conference hosted by Emily&rsquo;s List &mdash;an organization that, ironically enough, works to elect women who support abortion rights. She and a friend heard about the leak Monday night while driving to the house where she was staying. Almost immediately, she says, they turned the car around and headed to the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she stood in front of the courthouse that evening among hundreds of others, she emphasized the practical implications in her state, where access to abortion had become endangered once again. &ldquo;What frustrates me is we&#8217;ve had 50 years to codify this into law,&rdquo; Godlewski said in an interview, raising her voice above the roar of chants. &ldquo;The Democrats have had the House, the Senate and the White House, and yet we haven&#8217;t gotten this done. Now we&#8217;re waiting for the final hour to try to pull something together. Enough is enough.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Godlweski didn&#8217;t wait long to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a central campaign issue. By Thursday morning, she </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?emci=22681ef7-24cc-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=9e354a76-73cc-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&amp;ceid=26288975&amp;v=UKQ-27VbVIE&amp;feature=youtu.be"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her first abortion-related ad of the midterm season. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6173757"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6173757/bongbong-marcos-tiktok-philippines-election/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular posts on Joey Toledo&#8217;s TikTok account is a 13-second clip of <a href="https://time.com/6162028/bongbong-marcos-philippines-president-popular/" >Ferdinand &#8220;Bongbong&#8221; Marcos Jr.&#8217;s</a> conversation with Juan Ponce Enrile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the video, the 94-year-old</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrile&mdash;who served as justice secretary and defense minister under Marcos&rsquo; father, the Philippine dictator <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960316,00.html" >Ferdinand Marcos Sr.</a>&mdash;claims that the Philippines was so safe under martial law imposed by the elder Marcos that a Filipino could leave his home unlocked, and &#8220;nobody would touch it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video received 92,000 views, and while Toledo has some doubts about Enrile&#8217;s claims (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just sure if [Enrile&rsquo;s] story is 100% percent accurate because he&rsquo;s already old&#8221;), the 27-year-old says he believes Enrile &ldquo;knows what happened during that time.&rdquo; </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal of the video on TikTok, and many others like it, goes a long way to explaining why Bongbong Marcos looks likely to win <a href="https://time.com/6168999/philippines-elections-celebrity/" >the May 9 presidential election</a>&mdash;potentially returning one of the Philippines&rsquo; most prominent dynasties to power more than 35 years after it was ousted following decades of dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the 32 pro-Marcos TikTok creators TIME contacted would not speak on the record. But one, Toledo from Nueva Ecija province, some 69 miles north of the capital Manila, agreed. Typical of many of his peers, he does not believe the well documented history of the Marcos family&#8217;s <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,958727-1,00.html" >human rights abuses and corruption</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working by day as an IT support desk staffer, Toledo has had his account for eight months but says he noticed a big uptick in followers when he began posting pro-Marcos videos. Toledo says he is not affiliated with the Marcos campaign, and is not paid for his content, but many of his posts to his 22,000 TikTok followers contain outright misinformation. One post, a repurposed video, suggests that the Marcos family&rsquo;s vast wealth comes not from the <a href="https://time.com/4442653/philippines-duterte-marcos-heroes-cemetery/" >looting of Philippine public coffers</a>, but from earnings as a lawyer. Another video asserts that Marcos was &ldquo;the best president in the world&rdquo; during his time in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, they offer insight into how Bongbong Marcos has been able to leverage social media to rewrite the history of his father&#8217;s rule in the Philippines. The Marcos family amassed as much as $10 billion in ill-gotten wealth according to the </span><a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/846731468338347772/pdf/438540WP0Box327377B0Star01PUBLIC1.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Bank and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the dictator, 70,000 &#8220;enemies of the state&#8221; were arrested, 34,000 were tortured, and more than 3,000 killed, according to </span><a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/edsa/infographics/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But through countless TikTok videos, and other social media posts, a false picture of stability and economic growth has been created that leaves many Filipino voters pining for the &#8220;better years&#8221; of the Marcos regime</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcos leads by an unprecedented margin over other presidential contenders in pre-election surveys: Pulse Asia poll conducted in April showed him with a </span><a href="https://www.pulseasia.ph/april-2022-nationwide-survey-on-the-may-2022-elections/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">33-point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over his closest opponent&mdash;opposition candidate Vice President Leni Robredo. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigative reports from Philippine media outlets </span><a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/245402-networked-propaganda-marcoses-rewriting-history/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-yearender-marcos-jr-benefited-most-ele"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VERA Files</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that Marcos benefits from coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media platforms, especially through videos. Alan German, a campaign strategist at Philippine PR firm Agents International, tells TIME that some political content creators are paid as much as $4,700 on a monthly retainer basis&mdash;a small fortune in a country with a $170 monthly minimum wage. Bongbong Marcos, in an April 26 interview with </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/4/26/Bongbong-Marcos-fake-news-trolls.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN Philippines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has denied paying trolls to boost his image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While misinformation is common to social media everywhere, in the Philippines it is especially pernicious. <a href="https://time.com/5505458/facebook-maria-ressa-philippines/" >Facebook can be used data-free</a> on smartphones, but access to the wider internet, including TikTok, costs money. Together with the country&rsquo;s poor digital infrastructure, expensive cellular data and subpar media literacy, Filipinos often have difficulty accessing verified sources of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Facebook remains the dominant social media platform in the Philippines, TikTok has quickly become a widely used source for sharing political news and views in the Southeast Asian nation of 110 million. The Chinese-owned social media company is privately held, so its user data is hard to verify, but a report from </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-tiktok-stats#:~:text=The%20Philippines%20has%2036.0%20million,users%20aged%2018%20and%20above"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DataReportal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an independent data aggregator on digital trends worldwide,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found up to 36 million Filipinos use the app. (The same data aggregator reports Facebook has as many as </span><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2022-essential-facebook-stats-for-q1-2022-v01"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 million users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Philippines.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo says it&rsquo;s fun to make and share pro-Marcos content on the app&mdash;not least because he enjoys getting a rise out of supporters of Marcos&rsquo; rivals. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s just to vex the other party so that they&rsquo;ll have some engagement. You know how Filipinos are: they love clashes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His feckless approach to TikTok may explain why it works so well for him. Jonathan Corpus Ong, a disinformation researcher at Harvard University, says that compared to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, TikTok&rsquo;s algorithm can catapult a user to stardom with just one post in a couple of days. This encourages users like Toledo to create punchy content in bulk in the hopes of winning viral fame. &ldquo;The potential of misinformative content to achieve a &lsquo;viral sensation&rsquo; kind of dynamic is much higher in TikTok than in other platforms,&rdquo; Ong says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristoffer Rada, the public policy head of TikTok Philippines, says that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once a video is flagged for disinformation, TikTok deprioritizes it.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Alex Bowie&ndash;Getty Image</span><span class="caption" >President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos (1917 &#8211; 1989) gives a pre-election campaign speech to supporters in the run up to the Philippine presidential elections of 1986, Manila, Dec. 7 1985.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., was president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. Many celebrate him for projects that survive to this day, including the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the country&rsquo;s longest inter-island bridge. But his two-decade rule was also marred by massive human rights violations, corruption, and stealing from the national treasury. He was ousted in 1986 through a popular uprising, <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960881-1,00.html" >the People Power Revolution</a>, and the Marcos family fled to Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning from exile in 1991, <a href="https://time.com/4583037/philippines-marcos-burial-duterte-human-rights-protest/" >the Marcos family began revising history in its favor</a>, denying allegations of atrocities outright or remaining silent. Family members took up seats in the local government of their home province Ilocos Norte, successfully rehabilitating their image. (The dictator&rsquo;s widow, Imelda, even ran for president in 1998 but eventually withdrew amid low public support.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the Marcos family has leveraged the power of social media to recraft the narrative even more. Political science professor Julio C. Teehankee at De La Salle University in Manila says that Bongbong and the rest of the Marcos family have adapted Marcos Sr.&rsquo;s support networks and vast wealth to create a &ldquo;well-oiled&rdquo; and &ldquo;well-financed&rdquo; social media campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other factors contribute to Bongbong Marcos&rsquo; popularity: Successive governments since the fall of the Marcos regime have failed to address basic social problems. </span><a href="https://psa.gov.ph/poverty-press-releases/nid/165535#:~:text=Among%20families%2C%20the%20First%20Semester,(Tables%201%20and%203)."  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than one fifth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Filipinos live below the country&rsquo;s poverty threshold, while the riches are concentrated among businessmen and political families. A </span><a href="https://pidswebs.pids.gov.ph/CDN/PUBLICATIONS/pidspn1818.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a state-run think-tank estimated only around 1.4% of the population are high-income earners, estimated at $43,400 or more annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other factor is the age of the electorate. Around </span><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2022/2/8/youth-vote-56-percent-2022.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% of the 65.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registered voters are under 40&mdash;meaning that they either weren&rsquo;t born during the rule of Marcos Sr., or were too young to remember it. Teehankee says that social media, with its mandate to keep content short and succinct, flattens history&mdash;making it easier for myths and disinformation to take hold in the minds of young voters. &ldquo;They do not have any experience or memory or knowledge about the Marcos regime,&rdquo; he says, adding the Millennials and Gen Z appear to be driving much of the support for Bongbong Marcos on social media. Survey firm Pulse Asia also found that 72% of registered voters age 18-24 support Marcos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a tumultuous era in Philippine history, Marcos&rsquo; dictatorship is barely discussed in schools or in </span><a href="https://www.feu.edu.ph/index.php/2022/01/twistedtruths-the-dilemma-of-philippine-history-textbooks/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">textbooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result is that misinformation learned on social media tends to stick&mdash;even when supporters of Bongbong Marcos are confronted with fact-based rebuttals. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say [Ferdinand Marcos] really did steal money,&rdquo; Toledo says. &ldquo;There are a lot of projects built. Some of the money actually materialized.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toledo believes the fact of the Marcos dynasty&rsquo;s ill-gotten wealth is a falsehood peddled by long-time political rivals <a href="https://time.com/5793685/corazon-aquino-100-women-of-the-year/" >the Aquino family</a>. (After Marcos was ousted, Corazon, the wife of assassinated senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became president from 1986 to 1992 and their son, Benigno Aquino III, was president from 2010 until 2016.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled in July 2003 that the $658 million in deposits made by Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda into Swiss bank accounts and foundations was unlawfully acquired. In 2018, Imelda was also convicted of graft related to private foundations she created for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiding unexplained wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Fighting disinformation on TikTok</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some users are crusading against disinformation by creating their own videos that seek to fact-check the historical white-wash. Mona Magno-Veluz, a 55-year-old genealogist and a self-identified history enthusiast, began posting about Philippine historical figures and events in July 2021 to alleviate boredom during COVID-19 lockdowns. On the anniversary of Marcos&rsquo; declaration of Philippine martial law on Sept. 21, she posted a video dispelling the notion that the economy boomed during the dictatorship. She </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JarcgiZgILZqVZfiuT6kaftvlAL6Iq5gazMfBniAEYI/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cited her sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and explained the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sXEMOgybku4j_OcbulPP-N_WG_gFYImOAHOOXNDE2U/edit"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an external Google Docs link in her TikTok&rsquo;s page bio. That video has since had 1.6 million views and over 156,000 likes.</span></p>

<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of the response to her video was positive, Marcos loyalists attacked her in the comments section of her post. Magno-Veluz says many of them &ldquo;weren&#8217;t interested in understanding the economics. They were just there because they felt outrage that I hinted that the martial law era was not our golden years.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already a college student when Marcos was ousted, Magno-Veluz says she was surprised by how passionate Marcos supporters are in asserting that their version of history is more accurate. She says her critics&mdash;most of whom were too young to remember the Marcos regime&mdash;make her feel like &ldquo;being gaslighted by somebody who wasn&#8217;t there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok says it has partnered with the Philippine commission on elections and local broadcast network GMA News in a bid to combat disinformation on the platform. Leading newswire agency Agence France-Presse also partnered with TikTok to fact-check content shared by Philippine users. TikTok notifies those who post misinformation and takes their accounts down. A spokesperson for TikTok tells TIME that it does not share how many videos or posts have been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 70% of Toledo&rsquo;s posts on his political TikTok account now have disclaimers, which lead to the app&rsquo;s landing site for the May 9 polls. The site contains information about voting, but doesn&#8217;t attempt to fact-check false claims. Toledo says he hasn&rsquo;t received any warning from TikTok for promoting disinformation and adds that he is &ldquo;sure&rdquo; his posts &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t fake.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also says that he isn&rsquo;t worried about the shutdown of his account. &ldquo;The information will always be there. My account may disappear, but the information won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For Philippine voters, that is precisely the problem.</span></p>

<p>Gated communities are known for their manicured lawns, swimming pools, and wealthy residents. In Argentina, they&rsquo;re also known as the home of the world&rsquo;s largest rodents.</p>
<p>On a drizzly afternoon in March 2022, a family of nine capybaras&mdash;the larger ones weighing in at around 130 pounds&mdash;huddle together under the hedges that surround a famous soccer player&rsquo;s mansion. Munching intently on the grass, they barely look up when approached by cars or humans. These are just a few of the hundreds of capybaras that have taken over Nordelta, a private neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, over the last two years.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The capybaras have always been present here. For the first two decades after the community&rsquo;s construction in 1999, they kept themselves hidden, coming out only at night and darting from trees to lakes. But that began to change in 2020. With Nordelta&rsquo;s well-heeled human residents confined to their homes by Argentina&rsquo;s long and strict COVID-19 lockdown, its furrier inhabitants thrived. Spreading out across now empty parks, they reproduced rapidly, boosting their numbers by 16% in one year, according to estimates by local scientists. Then, after an unusually dry winter hit Argentina in June 2021, killing much of the grass in public areas, the capybaras got even bolder, crossing roads and venturing into private gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the conflict started,&rdquo; says Marcelo Canton, head of communications for the Nordelta Residents Association. The capybaras&mdash;known as &ldquo;carpinchos&rdquo; in Argentina&mdash;ate up lawns and massacred rose bushes. They caused traffic accidents, knocking delivery drivers from their bikes. Perhaps worst of all, for a country <a href="https://www.infobae.com/2011/09/16/605985-argentina-el-pais-la-region-mas-mascotas-habitante/"  target="_blank">fiercely devoted </a>to pets, the capybaras began to face off with dogs that confronted them on their new territory, causing injuries to both sides. &ldquo;Dog owners were very upset,&rdquo; Canton says. &ldquo;Especially because here, the dogs are mostly French Bulldogs or other small dogs. They can&rsquo;t defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class="image-wrapper no-caption"></figure>
<p>In July, a group of residents went to the press, griping about a capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; and calling for authorities to move the animals out to a nature reserve. The complaints triggered a huge backlash in both Argentine and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/22/argentina-capybaras-giant-rodents-gated-community"  target="_blank"> international media</a>. Viral posts on social media accused Nordeltans of hypocrisy, since their luxury neighborhood is built on the capybara&rsquo;s historic wetland habitat, with some dubbing the animals &ldquo;class warriors.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t help Nordelta&rsquo;s case that capybaras are extremely cute, with goofy rectangular heads and narrow eyes that make them look permanently sleepy.</p>
<p>But for all the anger leveled at Nordelta, the neighborhood does have a real problem on its hands: how do you deal with an influx of wildlife that wasn&rsquo;t there before in densely populated urban space? Cities around the world are increasingly having to answer that question. The expansion of urban areas, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is destroying the forests, wetlands and other ecosystems where animals have historically thrived. And at the same time, cities have become &ldquo;incredibly enriched environments,&rdquo; often containing an abundance of food, water, and shelter compared to their surrounding areas, says Peter Alagona, an environmental historian and author of<em><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520386310/the-accidental-ecosystem"  target="_blank"> The Accidental Ecosystem</a>.</em> The result is that animals losing their natural habitats are increasingly making the city their home.</p>
<p>Nordelta&rsquo;s confrontation with capybaras is just the beginning. Alagona argues that cities are due for a fundamental rethink of their relationship with urban wildlife. &ldquo;We need to start thinking about cities as multi-species communities, as potential refuges for creatures that, in the future, we may not see in natural spaces,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a grand ecological rearrangement taking place and cities are part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >AFP/Getty Images</span><span class="caption" >A capybara crosses a street while others eat grass in a gated community in Tigre, Buenos Aires province, on August 27, 2021. </span></figcaption></figure>
<hr />
<p><strong>About 15 miles west of Nordelta,</strong> the grass is tall and the air is full of mosquitoes. Wildcats, lizards, and nutria (the capybara&rsquo;s smaller cousin), roam unseen by humans on roughly 750 acres along the Luj&aacute;n River. Graciela Capodoglio, a former teacher, helped to found this nature reserve in Pilar, a suburb of Buenos Aires, in 2003, around the same time that gated communities began to proliferate around the city. Her goal was to use the space to teach city residents about the importance of protecting nature; today, the reserve is one of the region&rsquo;s last natural wetlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all this development, the animals have been corralled into smaller and smaller spaces,&rdquo; Capodoglio says over the hum of bugs and birds. &ldquo;And now, the whole country is suffering from a drought,&rdquo; which further threatens the wildlife here. The clearing of tens of millions of hectares of<a href="https://time.com/amazon-rainforest-disappearing/" > the Brazilian Amazon</a> and other rainforests, mainly for agriculture, has led, in the last few years, to the disappearance of South America&rsquo;s &ldquo;flying rivers,&rdquo; which once carried moisture across the region. The drier conditions, combined with rising temperature due to climate change, have sapped food and water sources for wildlife, and helped to <a href="https://time.com/5895167/brazil-fires-ricardo-salles-environment/" >spread forest fires.</a> In February, as wildfires lapped at the edges of Corrientes in the north of Argentina, newspapers published <a href="https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/incendios-corrientes-fuego-cede-impactan-imagenes-animales-huyen-llamas_0_jPdLaRffUJ.html"  target="_blank">dramatic images</a> of alligators, capybaras, and other animals fleeing the flames.</p>

<p>Capodoglio was &ldquo;furious&rdquo; when she read news stories about the capybara &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; in Nordelta. And again, in January 2022, when similar stories popped up about <a href="https://www.ambito.com/informacion-general/pilar/alarma-los-countries-una-invasion-lagartos-n5353521"  target="_blank">an invasion of tegus</a>&mdash;black-and-white lizards native to the region&mdash;in gated communities near the Pilar reserve. &ldquo;The word invasion drives me crazy! They were here first,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>In pre-pandemic times, people concerned about tegus on their properties would contact animal rescue shelters to take them away. But with those centers mostly closed because of COVID-19, Capodoglio says the reserve received a rush of calls from concerned residents. &ldquo;I try to explain to them that the poor tegu is an inoffensive animal,&rdquo; she says, noting that the lizards, will cut off their own tails to run away from dogs or larger animals that catch them. &ldquo;And it helps you keep rats out of your house! Why do we need to look at all animals as attackers? It&rsquo;s such an anthropocentric view. It pisses me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over in Nordelta, Canton, of the residents association, says that the group that wanted to remove all capybaras from the neighborhood was a minority of about a hundred out of some 45,000. After the media firestorm, he says, a second group of &ldquo;environmentalist residents&rdquo; spoke up, opposing any measures that could affect the capybaras or their urban habitat. &ldquo;Then finally, a third group in the middle came up, who said &lsquo;okay we have to respect the animals, but what are we going to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August 2021, that group made their case for some kind of intervention to the wildlife department of Buenos Aires province and in <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/amamos-a-los-carpinchos-la-respuesta-de-los-vecinos-de-nordelta-que-acusan-a-la-provincia-por-la-nid19082021/"  target="_blank">an open letter</a> in the national press. They pointed out that capybaras had been driven almost to extinction by poachers in Tigre, the municipality where Nordelta is located, by the 1990s, and that the creation of the gated community&mdash;where hunters don&rsquo;t venture&mdash;had saved the animals. But, they argued, the area &ldquo;could no longer feed or sustain&rdquo; today&rsquo;s numbers. The province <a href="https://www.infobae.com/salud/ciencia/2021/08/25/cual-es-la-mirada-cientifica-sobre-la-conducta-de-los-carpinchos-en-nordelta/#:~:text=Qu%C3%A9%20dijo%20la%20administraci%C3%B3n%20de,convivencia%20arm%C3%B3nica%E2%80%9D%20con%20la%20fauna."  target="_blank">agreed</a>, based on their observations from a visit in June, that there was an &ldquo;overpopulation&rdquo; problem. They then began to work with the municipal government and the Nordelta residents association&mdash;which acts almost like a local government because of Nordelta&rsquo;s private status&mdash;on a plan to restore &ldquo;harmonious coexistence&rdquo; between capybaras and humans, according to Canton, consulting with capybara experts at Argentina&rsquo;s national scientific research council, and a team of biologists hired by Nordelta.</p>
<p>Limiting capybara numbers is part of the plan. Officials have ruled out the idea of moving some capybaras to nearby nature reserves&mdash;suggested by the residents to bring the population back to the level it stood at five years ago&mdash;on the grounds that they had not learned to fear their natural predators and wouldn&rsquo;t last in the wild, Canton says. And there will, &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; be no culling of the animals in Nordelta, he adds. But capybara vasectomies are on the table. The province is consulting with vets before giving the greenlight for a trial, which would follow a few dominant males and monitor them for several years. A <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/15/deer-wars-and-death-threats"  target="_blank">deer vasectomy program </a>with similar goals in Staten Island has resulted in a <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2021/03/city-releases-new-data-on-controversial-staten-island-deer-vasectomy-program-is-it-working.html"  target="_blank">&ldquo;sizable decrease&rdquo;</a> in the deer population since 2016, but proved controversial among residents and conservationists. &ldquo;That is a mid- to long-term solution,&rdquo; Canton says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the only less natural measure that&rsquo;s under consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, the focus has been on softer measures. First there was an awareness campaign, using newsletters, social media, and outreach to local press to remind residents that capybaras are generally harmless and ideally are dealt with by simply ignoring them.</p>
<p>Next, the residents association began creating new habitats for the capybaras inside Nordelta, so they wouldn&rsquo;t need to resort to gardens. The human residents stopped cutting the grass so often in public parks and near lakes, to make it more comfortable for capybaras, and left some areas on the edges of town to go wild. Then they installed three &ldquo;buffer zones,&rdquo; made up of reeds and bushes for the animals to shelter in, at the edges of lakes within the neighborhood. Three more are under development, along with another site at a currently polluted stream that enters Nordelta from the north.</p>
<p>Canton says the creation of these newly rewilded areas has helped keep capybaras away from residents. The real test, though, will come in the next few months, as the dry winter season in Argentina puts pressure on the giant rodents&rsquo; food supply.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>As the global conversation</strong> around the importance of preserving biodiversity gets louder, many cities are trying to change their designs to enable humans and animals to share urban space in a climate-changed world. In <a href="http://www.wildwestend.london/"  target="_blank">London</a>, for example, the largest landowners in the central West End district are adding vegetation to roofs, walls and streets to create more of the plants needed by native birds, bees and bats. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/23/how-wildlife-crossings-are-helping-reindeer-bears-and-even-crabs-aoe"  target="_blank">Wildlife bridges</a>, which allow animals to safely cross roads or railways that have divided parts of their habitats, are in vogue in many cities: a network of reindeer viaducts are being built across Sweden, the largest ever animal overpass is <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/01/wildlife-crossing-liberty-canyon-los-angeles.html"  target="_blank">under construction </a>in Los Angeles, and in March Houston <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/03/116688-first-part-houston-land-bridge-opens-public"  target="_blank">opened</a> a &ldquo;landbridge&rdquo; connecting the two sides of its Memorial park, which have been separated for a century. Even buildings are being rethought: last year, it became mandatory for new buildings in New York City to incorporate<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-04/how-to-design-buildings-to-prevent-bird-crashes"  target="_blank"> bird-friendly elements,</a> such as patterned glass to prevent crashes.</p>
<p>The increasing threats of flash floods, heatwaves, and drought are prompting cities to restore green space and trees, which can absorb water and regulate temperature. Local governments should recognize that animals have their own &ldquo;ecosystem services&rdquo; to offer, argues Alagona. Rather than employing companies to exterminate rats, for example, cities could plant more trees that are conducive to owl nesting habits, and manage power lines better to prevent owl deaths. &ldquo;If we have more owls, we definitely have fewer rats,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;By thinking about wildlife and coordinating across different departments, we can create an environment that&#8217;s healthier for everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Thursday, South Korea&rsquo;s spy agency became the first in Asia <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220505000162&amp;np=1&amp;mp=1"  target="_blank">to join NATO&rsquo;s Cyber Defense Group</a> in a move that risks inflaming tensions with regional superpower China.</p>
<p>In a statement, South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it had been admitted as a contributing participant for NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), a cyber defense hub established in May 2008 in Tallinn, Estonia, focused on research, training, and exercises in the field of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cyberthreats are causing great damage to not only individuals but also separate nations and also transnationally, so close international cooperation is crucial,&rdquo; the NIS said.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>In response, Hu Xijin, the strident editor of Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece <em>The Global Times</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1522062382666682369"  target="_blank">tweeted</a> that the move was an affront to Beijing and even lays the groundwork for war in Asia. &ldquo;If South Korea takes a path of turning hostile against its neighbors, the end of this path could be a Ukraine,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Against the background of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea&rsquo;s admission to the group seems to reflect a hardening resolve among U.S. allies in response to mounting threats from, in principle, Moscow and Beijing, which has <a href="https://time.com/6163807/china-russia-putin-ukraine/" >backed Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s adventurism</a>. On April 29, a spokesman for China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/china-calls-russia-relationship-a-new-model-for-the-world"  target="_blank">hailed</a> ties with Russia as &ldquo;a new model of international relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, whether NATO was motivated by events in Ukraine to finally sign off on South Korea&rsquo;s membership is unclear. The NIS submitted its application to join the group in 2019 and has participated in the two most recent Locked Shields, the world&rsquo;s largest international live-fire cyberdefense exercise. The CCDCOE now has 27 NATO member countries and five non-NATO contributing participants.</p>

<p>Prof. Sean O&rsquo;Malley, a political scientist at Dongseo University in Busan, says South Korea&rsquo;s membership is &ldquo;a culmination of a very slow evolution over the past decade of getting cybersecurity to be recognized as a really serious threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite hosting some of the world&rsquo;s top tech companies, like LG and Samsung, South Korea has been a surprising laggard regarding cybercrime and only launched a <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/National_Strategies_Repository/National%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy_South%20Korea.pdf"  target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> under the <a href="https://time.com/6075235/moon-jae-in-south-korea-election/" >Moon Jae-in</a> administration in 2018.</p>
<p>This is despite South Korea being the principle target of <a href="https://time.com/4781809/ransomware-attack-north-korea-wannacry/" >increasingly frequent cyberattacks</a> from across the DMZ. A crack squad of 6,800 North Korean agents are engaged in fraud, blackmail and online gambling that together generate some $860 million annually, according to the Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy in Seoul. Many attacks originate from inside China.</p>
<p>And whether motivated by Beijing&rsquo;s backing of Russia or not, the move does certainly bring U.S. allies closer together. &ldquo;This is just one more arrow in the quiver for the United States and its allies,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Malley. &ldquo;And, of course, this is one more capacity where China would prefer South Korea be as independent as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nile Blass remembers hearing about Georgetown University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/news/georgetown-shares-slavery-memory-and-reconciliation-report-racial-justice-steps/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2016 report on its historical connections to slavery</a> before she even applied to the school. The report, which detailed how the university profited from the sale of 272 enslaved people in 1838, recommended steps for the university to atone for its role. For Blass, it became a factor in her decision to enroll at the university, which she saw as &ldquo;an educational institution where a Black student like myself could thrive.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If they&#8217;re dealing with their history in this capacity,&rdquo; Blass remembers her family thinking, &ldquo;that means that they&#8217;re doing something above and beyond, and that can probably spell something positive for the campus culture.&rdquo;</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Blass, now a graduating senior, did thrive on campus, she has also spent the last four years pressuring the university to do more to repay descendants for what was taken from their enslaved ancestors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The existence of these individuals and their work [permeates] the entire Georgetown experience, even if you&#8217;re not directly looking for it. That&#8217;s a debt owed,&rdquo; says Blass, who was, until recently, the school&rsquo;s student body president. &ldquo;There is direct economic harm to be found there.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Harvard become the most recent and one of the most prominent universities to reckon with its own complicity in slavery, acknowledging that university presidents, faculty, and staff enslaved more than 70 people in the years from 1636 to 1783, when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that slavery was unlawful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Enslaved men and women served Harvard presidents and professors and fed and cared for Harvard students,&rdquo; stated </span><a href="https://legacyofslavery.harvard.edu/report/introduction-and-findings#slavery-in-the-north"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Harvard report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released on April 26. &ldquo;Moreover, throughout this period and well into the 19th century, the University and its donors benefited from extensive financial ties to slavery.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society,&rdquo; Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said in a </span><a href="https://legacyofslavery.harvard.edu/about/aboutmessage-from-president"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the school community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university pledged to spend $100 million toward a &ldquo;Legacy of Slavery Fund&rdquo; that will support the continued study of Harvard&rsquo;s ties to slavery and will be used to implement other measures </span><a href="https://legacyofslavery.harvard.edu/report/recommendations-to-the-president-and-fellows-of-harvard-college"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the report&mdash;including that Harvard honor the labor of enslaved people with a memorial on campus; develop partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities; and improve educational access through partnerships with local colleges and nonprofits, to confront &ldquo;enduring inequities that impact descendant communities in the United States.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also recommended that Harvard identify the descendants of people enslaved by Harvard&rsquo;s leaders, faculty, and staff and &ldquo;engage with these descendants through dialogue, programming, information sharing, relationship building, and educational support.&rdquo; But it stops short of calling for direct financial reparations to those descendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some experts argue that&rsquo;s a missed opportunity for one of the country&rsquo;s wealthiest universities&mdash;Harvard has a </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-education-philanthropy-endowments-higher-education-51d411e8d3882ac38c97a22209d6ee7d"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$53 billion endowment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;to make a more meaningful difference for victims of slavery and their descendants. Advocates for financial reparations argue it&#8217;s a step that would help to address the lasting inequities that can be traced back to slavery in the United States, including the persistent racial wealth gap and under-representation of Black students in higher education. In 2016, the median white household had nearly 10 times the wealth of the median Black household, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Brookings</a>. And while about 12% of the U.S. population is Black, just 7% of students at both Harvard and Georgetown were Black in fall 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The institution and individuals in the institution were paid for their role in the buying, selling, trading of slaves,&rdquo; says Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, who has written about inequality and reparations in education. &ldquo;Cash was exchanged. So at some point, you should cut a check to the descendants of those who were burdened by those actions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>So if $100 million sounds like a lot, Perry says, it&#8217;s still &#8220;somewhat of an insult&#8221; considering what the institution can afford.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Perry, direct impact in the form of reparations would be all the more meaningful because, while honest acknowledgement of an institution&rsquo;s involvement in slavery is a step in the right direction, he thinks similar reports released at other universities have thus far had a &ldquo;minimal impact&rdquo; on the individual descendants of those who were enslaved. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Georgetown: The Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., acknowledged that it profited off the sale of enslaved people and pledged to give an admissions advantage to their descendants&mdash;similar to the admissions advantage offered to children of Georgetown faculty, staff and alumni. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university has admitted 16 descendants of enslaved people since 2016, <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2022/02/17/if-the-supreme-court-restricts-race-in-college-admissions-should-schools-adopt-slave-descent-as-a-factor-instead"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GBH News reported in February</a>. (Thousands of descendants have been identified, though it&#8217;s not clear how many have applied to the school.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, like Blass, have continued to call for more action and more engagement with descendants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-thirds of Georgetown students voted in spring 2019 to pass a student fee that would pay reparations to the descendants of those enslaved and sold to benefit Georgetown. Instead, the </span><a href="https://president.georgetown.edu/next-steps-on-slavery-memory-and-reconciliation/#"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">university announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would raise $400,000 annually to spend on projects benefiting descendant communities. In 2021, the university said it aimed to provide the </span><a href="https://president.georgetown.edu/an-update-on-slavery-memory-and-reconciliation/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first project grants that year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A spokesperson for Georgetown did not respond to a request for comment regarding the status of those grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that decision frustrated some students, including Blass, who doesn&rsquo;t want that money to be thought of as a charitable donation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is not a matter of charity,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you owe someone for work that is done, you pay them for it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div>Julia Thomas&mdash;a junior at Georgetown and a descendant of Sam Harris and Betsy Ware Harris, who were sold to benefit Georgetown in 1838&mdash;says she would like to see Georgetown and the Jesuits make direct payments to descendants, in addition to supporting projects like scholarship initiatives and campus memorials.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The issue of reparative justice for the descendants is larger than Georgetown taking action,&#8221; Thomas said in an email. &#8220;It must include the Jesuit order. After all, it was the Society of Jesus that enslaved my ancestors for the benefit of Georgetown College.&#8221;</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, students at Brown University also voted overwhelmingly in favor of the university identifying descendants of those who were enslaved at the university and paying them reparations. In November, the school released an update to its </span><a href="https://slaveryandjustice.brown.edu/sites/default/files/reports/SlaveryAndJustice2006.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2006 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about its ties to slavery, but did not take action on the student referendum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no active process underway to identify descendants or pay reparations, but it&#8217;s a question that continues to be relevant,&rdquo; Brian Clark, a spokesperson for Brown, said in an email, adding that the university is committed to remembering and addressing issues of injustice in its teaching, research, admissions, and hiring practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University who studies racial inequality and the economics of reparations, notes that most universities that have studied their own historical involvement with slavery have not gone much further in their responses than renaming buildings, removing Confederate statues, or erecting memorials to the contributions of enslaved people. But, while he says those moves just scratch the surface of what would be a commensurate response, he believes such a solution won&#8217;t be found in a piecemeal approach from a handful of universities.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think that colleges and universities or private donors actually have the capacity to meet a full-scale plan for reparations,&rdquo; he says, adding that he would like to see universities use their influence to advocate for a federal reparations plan that would help to eliminate the longstanding racial wealth gap across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If they truly feel a sense of obligation, given their history, then what they should do is actually pursue having a national program of reparations, and they should use their clout and influence to make that happen,&rdquo; Darity says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Perry is hoping that Harvard&rsquo;s report will inspire other institutions in higher education to reckon with their own history and complicity in slavery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Harvard, arguably, is the biggest name in higher ed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;As Harvard goes, so will other institutions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he would like to see those universities take more comprehensive steps, such as improving diversity in their student body and faculty, investing in Black-led companies and Black neighborhoods, and divesting from companies with a history of discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If more universities do that, he says, it would not only change the institutions taking those steps, &#8220;it can help transform higher ed as a whole.&rdquo;</span></p>
