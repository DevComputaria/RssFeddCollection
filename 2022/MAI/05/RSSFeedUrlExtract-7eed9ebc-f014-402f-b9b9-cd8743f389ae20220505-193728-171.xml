For the first time ever, members of Parliament will have the right to take parental leave from their jobs on Parliament Hill when they have or adopt a new baby. The House of Commons has unanimously agreed to adopt new rules, which will allow new parents who are serving as MPs to take up to 12 months of parental leave. The rules also give MPs who are expecting a baby the ability to take up to four weeks off as leave at the end of their pregnancy as well. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, who became the first female cabinet minister to give birth while in office, called the move a historic change and one that she hopes will lead to a culture change in legislative chambers across the country.
