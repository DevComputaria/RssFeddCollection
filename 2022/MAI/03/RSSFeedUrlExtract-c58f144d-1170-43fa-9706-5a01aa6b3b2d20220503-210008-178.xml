<p>Meta’s AI lab has created a massive new language model that shares both <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017797/gpt3-best-worst-ai-openai-natural-language/">the remarkable abilities and the harmful flaws</a> of OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">pioneering neural network GPT-3</a>. And in an unprecedented move for Big Tech, it is giving it away to researchers—together with <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/democratizing-access-to-large-scale-language-models-with-opt-175b/">details about how it was built and trained</a>.</p>



<p>“We strongly believe that the ability for others to scrutinize your work is an important part of research. We really invite that collaboration,” says Joelle Pineau, a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/12/1011944/artificial-intelligence-replication-crisis-science-big-tech-google-deepmind-facebook-openai/">longtime advocate for transparency in the development of technology</a>, who is now managing director at Meta AI.</p>



<p>Meta’s move is the first time that a fully trained large language model will be made available to any researcher who wants to study it. The news has been welcomed by many concerned about the way this powerful technology is being built by small teams behind closed doors.</p>



<p>“I applaud the transparency here,” says Emily M. Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington and a frequent critic of the way language models are developed and deployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a great move,” says Thomas Wolf, chief scientist at Hugging Face, the AI startup behind <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/20/1025135/ai-large-language-models-bigscience-project/">BigScience</a>, a project in which more than 1,000 volunteers around the world are collaborating on an open-source language model. “The more open models the better,” he says. </p>



<p>Large language models—powerful programs that can generate paragraphs of text and mimic human conversation—have become one of the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/21/1042835/2021-was-the-year-of-monster-ai-models/">hottest trends in AI</a> in the last couple of years. But they have <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/">deep flaws</a>, parroting misinformation, prejudice, and toxic language.</p>



<p>In theory, putting more people to work on the problem should help. Yet because language models require vast amounts of data and computing power to train, they have so far remained&nbsp;projects for rich tech firms. The wider research community, including ethicists and social scientists concerned about their misuse, has had to watch from the sidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=story-cta&amp;utm_campaign=subscribe-BAU">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Meta AI says it wants to change that. “Many of us have been university researchers,” says Pineau. “We know the gap that exists between universities and industry in terms of the ability to build these models. Making this one available to researchers was a no-brainer.” She hopes that others will pore over their work and pull it apart or build on it. Breakthroughs come faster when more people are involved, she says.</p>



<p>Meta is making its model, called Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT), available for non-commercial use. It is also releasing its code and a logbook that documents the training process. The logbook contains daily updates from members of the team about the training data: how it was added to the model and when, what worked and what didn’t. In more than 100 pages of notes, the researchers log every bug, crash, and reboot in a three-month training process that ran nonstop from October 2021 to January 2022.</p>



<p>With 175 billion parameters (the values in a neural network that get tweaked during training), OPT is the same size as GPT-3. This was by design, says Pineau. The team built OPT to match GPT-3 both in its accuracy on language tasks and in its toxicity. OpenAI has made GPT-3 available as a paid service but has not shared the model itself or its code. The idea was to provide researchers with a similar language model to study, says Pineau.</p>



<p>OpenAI declined an invitation to comment on Meta’s announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google, which is exploring the use of large language models in its search products, has also been criticized for a lack of transparency. The company sparked controversy in 2020 when <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/16/1014634/google-ai-ethics-lead-timnit-gebru-tells-story/">it forced out leading members of its AI ethics team</a> after they produced <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">a study that highlighted problems with the technology</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Culture clash</h3>



<p>So why is Meta doing this? After all, Meta is a company that has said little about how the algorithms behind Facebook and Instagram work and has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/">a reputation for burying unfavorable findings</a> by its own in-house research teams. A big reason for the different approach by Meta AI is Pineau herself, who has been pushing for more transparency in AI for a number of years.</p>





<p>Pineau helped change how research is published in several of the largest conferences, introducing a checklist of things that researchers must submit alongside their results, including code and details about how experiments are run. Since she joined Meta (then Facebook) in 2017, she has championed that culture in its AI lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That commitment to open science is why I’m here,” she says. “I wouldn’t be here on any other terms.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, Pineau wants to change how we judge AI. “What we call state-of-the-art nowadays can’t just be about performance,” she says. “It has to be state-of-the-art in terms of responsibility as well.”</p>



<p>Still, giving away a large language model is a bold move for Meta. “I can’t tell you that there’s no risk of this model producing language that we’re not proud of,” says Pineau. “It will.”</p>



<h3>Weighing the risks</h3>



<p>Margaret Mitchell, one of the AI ethics researchers Google forced out in 2020, who is now at Hugging Face, sees the release of OPT as a positive move. But she thinks there are limits to transparency. Has the language model been tested with sufficient rigor? Do the foreseeable benefits outweigh the foreseeable harms—such as the generation of misinformation, or racist and misogynistic language?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Releasing a large language model to the world where a wide audience is likely to use it, or be affected by its output, comes with responsibilities,” she says. Mitchell notes that this model will be able to generate harmful content not only by itself, but through downstream applications that researchers build on top of it.</p>



<p>Meta AI audited OPT to remove some harmful behaviors, but the point is to release a model that researchers can learn from, warts and all, says Pineau.</p>



<p>“There were a lot of conversations about how to do that in a way that lets us sleep at night, knowing that there’s a non-zero risk in terms of reputation, a non-zero risk in terms of harm,” she says. She dismisses the idea that you should not release a model because it’s too dangerous—which is the reason OpenAI gave for not releasing GPT-3’s predecessor, GPT-2. “I understand the weaknesses of these models, but that’s not a research mindset,” she says.</p>





<p>Bender, who coauthored the study at the center of the Google dispute with Mitchell, is also concerned about how the potential harms will be handled. “One thing that is really key in mitigating the risks of any kind of machine-learning technology is to ground evaluations and explorations in specific use cases,” she says. “What will the system be used for? Who will be using it, and how will the system outputs be presented to them?”</p>



<p>Some researchers question why large language models are being built at all, given their potential for harm. For Pineau, these concerns should be met with more exposure, not less. “I believe the only way to build trust is extreme transparency,” she says.</p>



<p>“We have different opinions around the world about what speech is appropriate, and AI is a part of that conversation,” she says. She doesn’t expect language models to say things that everyone agrees with. “But how do we grapple with that? You need many voices in that discussion.”</p>

<h2><strong>This company wants to use carbon dioxide to store renewable power on the grid</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Sourcing power: </strong>Renewable power has been growing worldwide, but sources like wind and solar aren’t available consistently. In the quest to find a better way to store power for the grid, an Italian startup called Energy Dome is turning to an unlikely source: carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Energy Dome turned to carbon dioxide because of its physics. When squeezed to high enough pressures, it turns into a liquid, which can be stored in small steel tanks close to where renewable energy is generated and used. Energy Dome’s technology is designed to allow the carbon dioxide to be accessed as needed and turned into electricity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Greater flexibility: </strong>The company has already started trials and promises it will soon be able to safely and cheaply store energy using carbon dioxide sourced from commercial vendors. However, experts warn it may take longer than expected, due to the scale of the engineering challenges involved. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/03/1051644/carbon-dioxide-storage-energy-dome/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a>.</p>

<p>In the quest to find a better way to store power for the grid, an Italian startup is turning to an unlikely source: carbon dioxide. The company, called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://energydome.com/" target="_blank">Energy Dome</a>, has built a test facility to put the greenhouse gas to work in energy storage.</p>





<p>Renewable power has been growing worldwide, but sources like wind and solar aren’t available consistently, creating a need for storage solutions. Today, most large-scale energy storage uses lithium-ion batteries, which are expensive, or pumped <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/01/1048726/droughts-are-cutting-into-californias-hydropower-heres-what-that-means-for-clean-energy/">hydropower</a>, which is only available in certain places. Cheap energy storage systems that can be deployed anywhere could unlock new potential for renewable power.</p>



<p>Energy Dome thinks carbon dioxide could have a role to play. The company says its demonstration plant, where it has designed and begun trials, will soon be able to safely and cheaply store energy using carbon dioxide sourced from commercial vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compressing gases to store energy isn’t new: for decades, a few facilities around the world have been pumping air into huge underground caverns under pressure and then using it to generate electricity in a natural gas power plant. But Energy Dome turned to carbon dioxide because of its physics.</p>



<p>Carbon dioxide, when squeezed to high enough pressures, turns into a liquid, which air doesn’t do unless cooled down to ultra-low temperatures. The liquid carbon dioxide can fit into smaller steel tanks close to where renewable energy is generated and used.</p>



<p>In Energy Dome’s designs, a flexible membrane holds the carbon dioxide in a huge dome at low pressure. When excess electricity is available, the gas goes through a compressor to reach high pressure. This process also generates heat, which is stored too.</p>



<p>Then, when energy is needed, the stored heat is used to warm up the carbon dioxide, which decompresses and turns a turbine, generating electricity.</p>

<p>Energy Dome’s CEO, Claudio Spadacini, says its first full-scale plants should cost just under $200 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), compared with about $300 per kWh for a lithium-ion <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/79236.pdf" target="_blank">energy storage system</a> today. Spadacini says that the costs could drop further, to about $100 per kWh, if the company is able to scale up to a few dozen large facilities. </p>



<p>The concept of compressed carbon dioxide storage is “really promising,” says <a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/meme/staff/edward-barbour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward Barbour</a>, an energy systems researcher at Loughborough University in the UK. However, he expects the company to face some significant engineering challenges, like keeping the heat exchangers working for the decades-long lifetime of the plant. </p>

<p>The demonstration facility where Energy Dome recently started trials has a capacity of 4 megawatt-hours, enough to power the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average American home</a> for about four and a half months. Spadacini says that after the demonstration facility is running, Energy Dome will move quickly to 200-MWh commercial-scale plants, aiming to begin construction as early as next year at a site in Italy.</p>



<p>The engineering challenges are “not insurmountable, but they’re not insignificant,” Barbour says. That means that the timelines Spadacini has quoted for scale-up might not be feasible, Barbour cautions: “I think there are kinks to be worked out that might take a little bit longer.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Research shows that businesses, governments, and consumers around the world are <a href="https://fsc.org/en/newsfeed/2021-global-consumer-research-reveals-escalating-concerns-about-climate-change-and-threats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly</a> concerned about the environment. But despite our apparent concern, we seem to be doing very little about it. Per a recent report, material extraction and use has nearly quadrupled in the last <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 years</a>, outpacing even population growth. The current economy is built on a linear approach where organizations harvest Earth’s natural resources, then create and sell products to consumers who eventually use and throw away these products. It is estimated that over 100 billion tons of material are harvested and consumed every year, with more than 90% ending up in landfills without being recycled.</p>



<p>The circular economy aims to change all this by promoting a more sustainable approach where natural resources are extracted efficiently; production is carried out in a manner where there is minimum wastage; and at the end of the product’s life, materials are recovered, regenerated, repaired, and reused for as long as possible so that businesses no longer have to extract virgin natural resources to fuel demand. The circular economy has the potential to significantly reduce pressure on the environment, create a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/impact/helping-the-circular-economy-become-a-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-trillion</a> dollar economy, stimulate innovation, and create <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90343657/the-circular-economy-could-create-an-enormous-jobs-boom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enormous</a> numbers of jobs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="833" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?w=1200" alt="" class="wp-image-1050756" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png 1200w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/132161331_l.png?resize=768,533 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>What’s stopping the circular economy from taking over?</strong></h3>



<p>Achieving a circular economy is easier said than done. Even the most well-intentioned companies can run into major obstacles while going down the circular economy path. According to <a href="https://www.cips.org/supply-management/news/2021/april/four-supply-chain-barriers-to-the-circular-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gartner</a>, there are four main challenges to the circular economy. First, returning ownership of end-of-life materials can be challenging. Organizations must do a deep dive in understanding how products are consumed and promote new supply chain models where expired products return to manufacturers. Second, raw materials must have enough residual value at end-of-life so they continue to be relevant to the business. Third, for businesses to make a compelling case to stakeholders, they must first possess an understanding of the quality, quantity, and intrinsic value of raw materials being returned. Fourth, the complexity of the product matters— the less complex the product being returned, the easier and cheaper the reprocessing, and vice versa.</p>



<h3><strong>How digitization of supply chains can boost circular economies</strong></h3>



<p>Digital innovation and the circular economy are kind of symbiotic in nature. In times of increasing internet proliferation, it’s hard to imagine any circular economy initiative that isn’t aided through technology. While there can be a number of ways in which digitization can positively impact the circular economy, here are the top three:</p>



<h4>1. <strong>Digitization can help organizations make better, more sustainable decisions</strong>.</h4>



<p>Digital technologies enable information to travel alongside the product. This enables businesses to capture, store, and analyze consumption patterns, which in turn helps organizations make better decisions. For example, research shows that <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">70%</a> of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are related to material handling and use. If businesses have insights into how full their aircraft, ship, or truck is, they can determine in real time how efficient their delivery will be. This translates to better efficiency, lower fuel costs, shorter delivery cycles, and reduced GHG. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-2020-thyssenkrupp-elevators-max-predictive-maintenance-solution-further-established-itself-as-the-industrys-most-transformative-service-technology-301193766.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thyssenkrupp</a>, one of the world’s leading elevator manufacturers, installed a cloud-based predictive maintenance system on 130,000 of its elevators worldwide. Its sensors collect health data of its components, systems, and performance. This helps Thyssenkrupp provide better service, extended elevator uptimes, and longer product lifespans.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Digitization can help unlock greater value across entire supply chains</strong>. Traditionally, most businesses are focused on connecting data and devices across their customer base. Digitization can be used to unlock a number of isolated parts, partners, and consumers from across the entire value chain. For instance, a raw material supplier can tap into the stocking system of a manufacturer (via APIs) to proactively validate if they are running out of certain raw materials. Once raw materials have reached end-of-life, manufacturers can leverage digital technologies to gauge whether the products have reached sufficient intrinsic value to be returned to them. This creates an opportunity for businesses to be more efficient, less resource intensive, and create less waste and emissions in the process. An increasing number of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.veltha.eu/blog/how-digital-platforms-are-enabling-circular-economy-innovation/" target="_blank">digital platforms</a> are promising to create tighter value-chain integrations and assist various manufacturers in transitioning to a circular economy model. On the consumer end, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/sustainable-retail-tech-circular-economy/" target="_blank">digital marketplaces</a> are helping to create more sustainability-conscious consumers.</p>



<p>3. <strong>Digital supply chains need to be reliable and secure</strong>. Supply chain digitization offers the promise of greater speed, efficiency, visibility, and control. However, the increased prevalence of APIs means that an organization’s attack surface increases. In the same way that a single container ship trapped in the Suez Canal can interrupt the world economy, an API that is unavailable or untrustworthy can disrupt important supply chain processes. As organizations digitize, they need to take the measures necessary to protect their digital assets.</p>



<h3><strong>How Citrix is engaging the circular economy</strong></h3>



<p>Citrix technologies empower individuals and businesses to work from anywhere and embrace adaptable work models. These technologies allow organizations to embrace a secure hybrid work model. This also means that organizations using Citrix can dramatically reduce commuting emissions while meeting employee needs for flexibility, given how <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/reducing-your-carbon-footprint-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27%</a> of U.S. emissions derive from transportation sources and office-related commuting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Workers using Citrix solutions can use low-energy devices and use those same devices for longer, reducing cost and emissions while keeping hazardous waste out of landfills. This supports two key principles of a circular economy with device reuse and waste reduction.</p>



<p>Citrix technologies also play a vital role in facilitating a seamless move to energy efficiency and lower carbon cloud computing. Citrix’s App Delivery and Security solution protects and scales APIs that are so vital to a streamlined and efficient digital supply chain. Protecting the digital backbone is an important step in moving to a more circular economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shift to the circular economy will not be easy, but it will be rewarding. Customers are looking for businesses that provide great service, but also share their core values. Companies that leverage digitization to embrace circularity will be seen as visionary, and as such will be rewarded with deeper customer relationships and loyalty. As the old saying goes, what goes around, comes around.</p>

<p>Midnight, 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 8:30 a.m., 9 a.m.: these times are ingrained in Queeny Song’s mind. For over a week in April, the 24-year-old Shanghai resident had to get her phone out at these five points every day to refresh a different grocery delivery app in hopes of grabbing a hard-to-get delivery slot.</p>



<p>During Shanghai’s ongoing month-long lockdown, these online grocery apps have been a lifeline for stranded residents. Song says that about 60 to 70% of her groceries have been purchased through online apps since the lockdown began. Without them, she would have run out of food.</p>



<p>The Shanghai lockdown is the latest stage of a two-year roller-coaster ride for the online grocery industry in China. Its rise and fall and rise again has mirrored the tightening and loosening of China’s covid-19 restrictions: apps like Dingdong, Alibaba’s Hema, and Meituan’s Maicai have struggled whenever lockdowns are relaxed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as China continues with its zero-covid strategy, the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/24/1051073/wechat-shanghai-lockdown-protest-video-the-voice-of-april/">harsh lockdown measures</a> have given the industry another chance to shine after a year of disappointing business returns. Whether it continues to succeed when things are back to normal is another question.</p>



<h3>The rise and fall of online grocers</h3>



<p>Around 2015, Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba, started experimenting with ideas to incorporate grocery shopping into the country’s thriving e-commerce landscape. It wasn’t until 2018 and 2019 that the industry really began to take off, with dozens of new startups competing for attention and investments. But growth was modest; startup failures were common.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was the first nationwide lockdown in China, in the first few months of 2020, that really supercharged the industry’s growth. As Chinese people first began to grapple with what it meant to be sheltering in place, they relied on these apps, most of which launched in 2018 and 2019, to have their supplies delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It soon grew into one of the hottest new tech industries in China, with venture capital funding pouring in and tech giants like DiDi and Meituan eager to take a slice. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/what-can-we-expect-in-china-in-2021">February 2021 McKinsey report</a> predicted that “online grocery shopping will likely be one of the most contested and contentious consumer facing sectors in China in 2021.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And contested it was, as players in the market were not afraid to spend: according to an anonymous executive at the now-defunct Chengxin Youxuan, the e-grocer arm of DiDi, quoted in the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/In-depth-The-shakeout-in-China-s-community-group-buying-market">Chinese business publication</a> Caixin, “The entire market was burning at least 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) every month.” In June 2021, startups Dingdong and MissFresh filed to go public in the United States on the same day, racing to be the first Chinese publicly traded online grocery company.</p>





<p>But things started to take a downturn last year. Despite the hype and money, these companies struggled to make a profit as lockdowns eased and people simply went back to shopping in person. What’s worse, they were caught in China’s new fight against antitrust behavior. The Chinese government was quick to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3123894/community-group-buying-chinese-regulators-fine-businesses-tied-big-tech">impose fines</a> and <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/12/22/consumers-love-cheap-groceries-but-can-community-group-buying-withstand-government-scrutiny/">pen editorials</a> questioning the value of the industry.</p>



<p>As a result, the once-promising startups and big tech companies decided to cut back on their expansion plans, implement massive layoffs, or outright file for bankruptcy. DiDi and Ele.me, two successful tech companies that bet on online grocery as their new growth driver, decided to shut down those services. At least two more online grocery startups have closed their businesses in the last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest lockdowns are giving the industry a second chance. With other Chinese cities like Beijing and Hangzhou also facing imminent lockdowns, millions of people are once again downloading these apps and relying on them on a daily basis. In fact, Dingdong’s app rose to third place in the App Store’s free app chart in China in the beginning of April.</p>



<h3>The daily battle</h3>



<p>While the luckier Shanghai residents may receive one-off free grocery packages from their employers or local governments, most people, like Song, needed to figure out a way to buy their own groceries. Some residents <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/shanghai-lockdown-wechat-group-buying/">formed neighborhood groups through messaging apps</a>, collecting everyone’s order and bulk-buying directly from nearby farms or food factories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Song soon realized that buying groceries with all her neighbors means she didn’t get to make her own choices. She lives in an older residential neighborhood where over three-fourths of the people are seniors or families with children. While her neighbors are placing family-size orders for things like five pounds of pork, such purchases would take her forever to consume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only other option for her, then, is the grocery apps. She frantically refreshes Dingdong, Hema, and Meituan Maicai every day to get a slot.</p>



<p>But with the lockdown interrupting the supply chain for many goods, including groceries, even placing an order on those apps requires luck and dedication. Like Black Friday shoppers waiting to bust the store doors open, Shanghai residents are swarming onto the apps at the designated time to try to buy as much as they can before the stocks run out in seconds. It can be stressful and frustrating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li, a consultant in Shanghai who’s only using her surname because she wishes to stay anonymous, also got up early every morning for a week to try her luck with half a dozen different apps. But during the lockdown, she didn’t secure one successful order, while her mother, living under the same roof, managed to get three. There was one time when Li put hundreds of RMB worth of groceries into the shopping cart—yet when she came to the payment stage, the only thing left in stock was a bag of candies.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/subscribe?utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=story-cta&amp;utm_campaign=subscribe-BAU">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>“Because of the explosive increase in Shanghai users’ demand, the purchase experience will certainly be different from how it was in ordinary times. The success rate for placing orders will be low,” the grocery app Dingdong said in an emailed response to MIT Technology Review. “In this situation, our product principle is to prioritize impartiality.” The company says that’s why it restocks at the same time every day and approves a random portion of the orders each time.</p>



<p>How the industry deals with these issues may determine what it looks like when life goes back to normal. Can it retain these new consumers once people are able to go to their nearby grocery stores again? It’s hard to say, but investors are no longer as optimistic as they were in 2020, and users are likely split.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Song says she will keep apps like Dingdong and JD on her phone, because she’s thankful that they have kept her and other people fed during a scary time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Li, the other Shanghai resident, thinks differently. “It is still my second choice. I’m only shopping on them because I can’t in any other way,” she says. “After the pandemic, I’m sure I won’t use them anymore.”</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the darling of businesses and governments because it not only promises to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add tens of trillions</a> to the gross domestic product (GDP), but it comes with all the excitement of action-packed movies or dopamine-drenched gaming. We are mesmerized by computer vision, natural language processing, and the uncanny predictions of recommendation engines. It protects us from fraud, lowers inventory costs, and teases us with programming we might enjoy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1013" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hidden-brain.png" alt="stock image of lit-up neuron" class="wp-image-1051048" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hidden-brain.png 1800w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hidden-brain.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hidden-brain.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hidden-brain.png?resize=1536,864 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></figure>



<p>The current state of the art, deep learning, comes from a brilliant concept to model algorithms <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-concise-history-of-neural-networks-2070655d3fec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on how the human brain functions</a>. The way neurons wire together inspire the structure of mathematical calculations. And why not? We are making computers more human with eyes (video), ears (microphone), and fingers (temperature &amp; vibration sensors).</p>



<p>The name, AI, implies a replication of human intelligence in silicon form. Yet, it’s easy to lose sight of the hidden brain that brings AI to useful life. Let’s explore the neuroscience as a metaphor to understand this premise.</p>



<p>The typical adult brain <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-big-is-the-brain-2794888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weighs about 3 lbs</a>. and consumes <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JacquelineLing.shtml#:~:text=The%20brain%20consumes%20energy%20at,of%20the%20brain%2020%20W." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 WATTs</a> of power. It is a remarkably efficient machine. Nobel prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman alludes to this efficiency-seeking function when he describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System 1 and System 2 thinking</a>. He proved that we have a subconscious, and thus low-powered, method of processing information. It operates more often than the higher-powered, executive function.</p>



<p>Neuro-anatomy experts believe that memories are encoded with emotions, but those emotions are not individually stored. They are essentially references built and stored in the limbic system. Basically, we remember an event and then there is a lookup table for how we felt about it. It is also a powerful influence on how we subconsciously make choices.</p>



<p>This limbic system, located in the middle brain, influences future decisions because <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-part-of-the-brain-controls-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it uses emotional memory as a framework</a> for what might serve us or what might slay us. Without it, we make sub-optimal choices because we lose context for risk or reward.</p>



<p>Similarly, AI analysis without all the right data leads to a faulty future. Therefore, it is worthwhile to talk about how organizing and presenting “all the right data” is critical. Management of the messy, high-volume, unstructured data should be considered as important to AI as the limbic system is to the predictive function of the human brain.</p>



<p>Yet, there are other factors to automatic decision-making beyond the emotional memory system. Let us explore the brain metaphor further. Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson argue in their book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_in_the_Brain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</a></em>, how unconscious we are about the nature of our own behaviors. They make the case that we are like our primate “cousins” in acting according to social motivations. Whether you consider this evolutionary biology or learned in the family of origin, matters less than understanding that there is something else hidden in our human brains. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This blind spot might also explain why technologists often oversee data management as phenomenon of culture. Typically, pundits only write about data management in two dimensions. The first is technology focused. It begins with byte sizes, throughput, and access patterns. This is a platform mindset that affords the procurement, storage, and availability of data. It has a strong bias to metadata (data about data) because this is the steering wheel with which to drive the car.</p>



<p>The second dimension commonly exploited is process. This systems-level view comprehends the entire pipeline, from acquisition at the source, to sorting and shuffling, to cataloging, to presenting, and finally to archiving. It is the farm-to-table point of view. Or rather, farm-to-Tupperware point of view. It concerns itself with the “how,” while technology takes a “what” perspective.</p>



<p>The third, and arguably invisible, dimension lies in culture, or the “who.” Culture can be described as a set a set of behaviors anchored by a shared belief system and bound by group norms. Culture pulls the puppet strings of process and technology. Yet, it is the most overlooked factor in data management.</p>



<p>Many institutions race to deploy technology and tool processes without first understanding how they want their culture to mature. They would be better served to model themselves in the way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive psychologists</a> study the most successful people. Those researchers investigate the belief systems and behaviors that are common in the truly accomplished.</p>



<p>While it would be worthwhile to provide a few case studies to prove this point, for the sake of brevity, we will present a summary of findings of the most successful in data management.</p>



<p>It begins with a shift in belief systems around data. In this new paradigm, data is just not an artifact of what happened; it’s asset with tremendous economic implications. And unlike other items on the balance sheet, it can appreciate in value over time.</p>



<p>With that in mind, find below a checklist of new behaviors associated with a shift in mindset around data.</p>



<ul><li>Data is federated into a fabric, not centralized nor siloed.</li><li>Knowledge is organized by context and tagged by both publishers and subscribers.</li><li>Models are preserved for continuous learning and accountability.</li><li>Transparency (observability) mitigates legal and regulatory pressures.</li><li>A broader view of ethics expands beyond the initial concerns for privacy.</li><li>Machine learning automates data engineering tasks.</li><li>Knowledge workers become value-creation workers.</li><li>Top-down, data-driven decisions evolve into bottom-up shared insights.</li><li>Data is measured in economic terms and not accounting terms.</li></ul>



<p>So, if your organization aims at exploiting AI, do not overlook the importance of modern data management and the fundamentals that make it up. Begin by benchmarking the current state to the desired state. Build a cross-disciplinary approach to overcome the gaps. Lean heavily on technologists, process engineers, organizational developers, and economists in formulating a game plan.<br><br>If you have interest in going deeper into this modern data management philosophy, <a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/servers/industry-market/the-ugly-truth-about-data-management.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/servers/industry-market/the-ugly-truth-about-data-management.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please check out this white paper</a> authored by Bill Schmarzo, the dean of big data, and an esteemed colleague at Dell Technologies. </p>

<h2><strong>Climate change is making India’s brutal heat waves worse</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Blistering temperatures:</strong> Heat waves are scorching India and Pakistan this week, breaking records as the region enters the hottest time of the year. Some states in India have already seen temperatures top 43 °C (110 °F).<br><br><strong>Peaking early: </strong>Extreme heat can be deadly, especially for a region where many lack access to cooling. And climate change is making heat waves more frequent and severe. Usually, peak temperatures in the region come in May and June, just before monsoon rains bring relief, but this year has been particularly hot, particularly early.</p>



<p><strong>Accelerated change:</strong> The effects of climate change on weather can sometimes be difficult to tease out.

<p>Heat waves are scorching India and Pakistan this week, breaking records as the region enters the hottest time of the year.</p>



<p>Some states in India have seen temperatures top 43 °C (110 °F), with northwest India likely to see even higher temperatures in the coming days, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).</p>



<p>Extreme heat can be deadly, especially for a region where many lack access to cooling. And climate change is making heat waves more frequent and severe, with periods of hot days stretching out longer in places like South Asia.</p>



<p>This heat wave is particularly concerning for its timing and its spread, says <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.climate.iitb.ac.in/en/employee-profile/prof-arpita-mondal" target="_blank">Arpita Mondal</a>, a climate researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Usually, peak temperatures in the region come in May and June, just before monsoon rains bring relief, she explains, but this year has been particularly hot, particularly early. March of this year was the hottest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://internal.imd.gov.in/press_release/20220402_pr_1551.pdf" target="_blank">on record</a>, with an average temperature of 33.1 °C (nearly 92 °F).</p>



<p>The problem is also widespread across the country, affecting not only the typical hot spots in the northwest and southeast but also regions that aren’t used to seeing so much extreme heat, Mondal says. And the effects are even more stark because of a lack of rainfall so far this season.</p>



<p>“It’s part of a broader climate-change signal,” says <a href="https://amir.eng.uci.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amir AghaKouchak</a>, a climate researcher at the University of California, Irvine. India’s average annual temperature increased at a rate of 0.62 °C per 100 years between 1901 and 2020, according to data from the<a href="https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/india/climate-data-historical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> World Bank</a>. And maximum temperatures have climbed even more quickly, at a rate of 0.99 °C every 100 years.</p>



<p>“People think a degree or two might not matter,” AghaKouchak says, but when average temperatures increase by even small amounts, it means extreme events are becoming more likely.</p>



<p>The effects of climate change on weather can sometimes be difficult to tease out. But for heat waves, researchers have “very high confidence” that climate change is making the problem worse, AghaKouchak says.</p>



<p>Heat can have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/10/1028172/climate-change-human-body-extreme-heat-survival/" target="_blank">devastating impacts on human health</a>—356,000 deaths globally in 2019 were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673621017001" target="_blank">linked to extreme heat</a>. The risk is greatest for elderly people and children, but anyone without adequate access to cooling can be affected, especially if heat continues for days at a time without letting up at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Forecasting and early warning systems can help people <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/05/02/143103/how-to-prepare-cities-and-citizens-for-more-killer-heat-waves/" target="_blank">prepare for extreme heat</a>. And the IMD has started focusing on forecasting heat waves in recent years, Mondal says.</p>



<p>However, the realities of a developing country mean that many people will still come into harm’s way during heat waves in India. As of 2019, only about <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/india-heat-cooling-challenge-temperature-air-conditioning/">7%</a> of Indian households had an air conditioner. And staying inside when temperatures peak might not be an option for people who depend on income from daily work, Mondal says.</p>



<p>Some local governments are trying to adapt to extreme heat. Ahmedabad, a city in western India, experienced an especially devastating heat wave in May 2010: the official death count reached 800 people, and up to 1,300 deaths have been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24633076/" target="_blank">attributed</a> to it indirectly. In 2013, the city launched a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ahmedabad-heat-action-plan-2018.pdf" target="_blank">heat action plan</a>, which included early warning systems for residents, training for health-care professionals, and adjustments to help cool buildings naturally.</p>



<p>Since then, other local governments have followed suit and created plans of their own, but some hope to see more national action to help people adjust to heat, Mondal says.</p>

<p>Cutting emissions will help prevent the worst future warming scenarios, but the current reality is already difficult to endure for many. And India’s deadly heat waves offer just one example of who will be most affected by a changing climate.</p>



<p>“Here are 1.4 billion people who will be affected by this heat wave, the majority of whom contributed very little to global warming,” Mondal says. “This phenomenon should put an end to the question of why people should care about climate change.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minneapolis Police Department violated civil rights law through a pattern of racist policing practices, according to a <a href="https://mn.gov/mdhr/assets/Investigation%20into%20the%20City%20of%20Minneapolis%20and%20the%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Department_tcm1061-526417.pdf">damning report</a> published today by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The report, which is the result of a two-year inquiry, found that officers stop, search, arrest, and use force against people of color at a much higher rate than white people, and covertly surveilled Black individuals, organizations and politicians not suspected of any crimes via social media. The report also revealed a pattern of breakdowns in investigating and disciplining officers over complaints about use of force and other misconduct.</p>



<p>The findings are consistent with MIT Technology Review’s <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/secret-police-surveillance-investigation-minnesota/">investigation of Minnesota law enforcement agencies</a>, which has revealed <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/03/1046676/police-surveillance-minnesota-george-floyd/">an extensive surveillance network</a> that targeted activists in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report establishes probable cause that the City of Minneapolis and the MPD violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The Human Rights Department will now work with Minneapolis public officials to develop a consent decree, which will require &#8220;specific changes to be made and timelines for those changes&#8221;, which will be enforceable by the state&#8217;s courts.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Severe disparities&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) “engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory, race-based policing,” begins the 72-page report. Investigators reviewed roughly “700 hours of body-worn camera footage and nearly 480,000 pages of City and MPD documents.” The state’s report relies on statistical analyses that weigh differing outcomes for white and non-white Minneapolitans in similar circumstances.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Since 2010, of the 14 individuals that MPD officers have killed, 13 of those individuals were people of color or Indigenous individuals,” the report states. “People of color and Indigenous individuals comprise approximately 42% of the Minneapolis population but comprise 93% of all MPD officer-involved deaths between January 1, 2010, to February 2, 2022.”</p>



<p>A clear racial disparity can be seen in the widespread use of chemical and other “less-lethal” weapons as well. MPD officers deploy pepper spray against Black people at a higher rate than they do against white people. From the report: “Officers recorded using chemical irritants in 25.1% of use of force incidents involving Black individuals. In contrast, MPD officers recorded using chemical irritants in 18.2% of use of force incidents involving white individuals in similar circumstances.” Overall, according to the report, “between January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, 63% of all use of force incidents that MPD officers recorded were against Black individuals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traffic stops were unfortunately no different. “Although Black individuals comprise approximately 19% of the Minneapolis population, MPD’s data shows that from January 1, 2017, to May 24, 2020, 78%—or over 6,500—of all searches conducted by MPD officers were searches of Black individuals or their vehicles during officer-initiated traffic stops.” Black people in Minneapolis are at six times greater risk of being treated with force during traffic stops than their white neighbors, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minneapolis Police Department has not replied to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Illegal surveillance</h3>



<p>The report also describes the department’s use of secret social media accounts to monitor Black people: “MPD officers used covert, or fake, social media accounts to surveil and engage Black individuals, Black organizations, and elected officials unrelated to criminal activity, without a public safety objective.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online, officers used covert accounts to follow, comment in, and message groups like the NAACP and the Urban League while posing as like-minded individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In one case, an MPD officer used an MPD covert account to pose as a Black community member to send a message to a local branch of the NAACP criticizing the group. In another case, an MPD officer posed as a community member and RSVP’d to attend the birthday party of a prominent Black civil rights lawyer and activist,” the report says.</p>



<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/secret-police-surveillance-investigation-minnesota/">MIT Technology Review’s reporting</a> shows that officers kept at least three watch lists of people present at and around protests related to race and policing. Nine state and local policing groups were part of a multi-agency response program called Operation Safety Net, which worked in concert with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Department of Homeland Security to acquire surveillance tools, compile data sets, and increase communication sharing during the racial justice protests in the state. The program <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047413/secret-police-surveillance-protesters-george-floyd-operation-safety-net/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/17/1047413/secret-police-surveillance-protesters-george-floyd-operation-safety-net/">continued long past its publicly announced demobilization</a>.</p>



<p>Though our investigation did not probe the extent of racial bias, it showed that local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies learned to work in concert to render anonymous protesting—a core tenet of free-speech protection under the First Amendment of the US Constitution—all but impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong><em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/secret-police-surveillance-investigation-minnesota/">The Secret Police: An MIT Technology Review investigation</a></em></strong></h3>



<p><em>This story is part of a series that offers an unprecedented look at the way federal and local law enforcement employed advanced technology tools to create a total surveillance system in the streets of Minneapolis, and what it means for the future of policing.</em>&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/secret-police-surveillance-investigation-minnesota/">You can find the full series here</a></em>.</p>



<h3>Lack of accountability</h3>



<p>Not only were these covert social media accounts used to track individuals not suspected of a crime, but the MPD officers behind the accounts sought to influence the democratic process: “MPD officers used MPD’s covert accounts to send private messages criticizing elected officials, while posing as community members.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Included in these sham conversations were a Minneapolis city council member and a state elected official. The report states, “Police officers using MPD’s covert social media to contact and criticize elected officials is an inappropriate use of official City resources. This inappropriate covert activity can also undermine the democratic process because false communications can distort elected officials’ perspectives and understanding of positions taken by community members.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, “MPD’s oversight of officers’ covert social media is insufficient and ineffective.” The MPD does not have a complete and accurate list of all the social media accounts used in a covert manner, according to the report: the department’s accounting of these activities “did not include at least two dozen additional covert accounts.” The MPD also lacks policies “to ensure that covert accounts are being used for legitimate investigative purposes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When members of the public sought remedy for perceived abuses and misconduct, they were met with a system in which “complaints are inadequately investigated and officers are not consistently held accountable for misconduct.” As an example, the report cites a troublingly long turnaround time for internal investigations: “Between January 2010 and May 2021, the average time that it took Office of Police Conduct Review and/or Internal Affairs to complete an investigation and for a Police Chief to issue a final disciplinary decision after a police misconduct complaint was filed was over 475 days, and the median time was over 420 days.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Department of Justice is currently investigating the City of Minneapolis and the MPD for possible violations of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
