<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court is </span><a href="https://time.com/6172868/roe-wade-supreme-court/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> considering overturning the landmark </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling on abortion rights, according to a leaked </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">draft opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If carried out, abortion will no longer be considered a constitutional right in the U.S., and each state will be free to determine the legality of the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1973, </span><a href="https://time.com/3669867/roe-v-wade-history/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gave women in the U.S. an absolute right to an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy, and limited rights beyond then. While abortion is legal in some form in every state under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">abortion access has been eroded over the years in more than a dozen states. </span><a href="https://time.com/6099921/texas-self-managed-abortions/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, passed a law in 2021 allowing residents to sue clinics and doctors for carrying out an abortion after six weeks. In Mississippi&mdash;the state at the center of the Supreme Court case&mdash;most abortions are banned after 15 weeks.</span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rollback of abortion rights in the U.S. has been mirrored in many other nations globally, where the rise of pro-life movements have coincided with radical political or cultural shifts. In other countries, abortion rights activists have succeeded in pushing for less restrictive laws as part of a broader fight for women&rsquo;s rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a look at countries where abortion is banned, restricted, or has recently been legalized.</span></p>
<h2><b>Countries where abortion is illegal</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?category[1348]=1348"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Reproductive Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global legal advocacy organization, there are 24 countries in the world where abortion is completely prohibited. These include Andorra and Malta in Europe, El Salvador and Honduras in Central America, Senegal and Egypt in Africa, and the Philippines and Laos in Asia. Some </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?category[1348]=1348"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90 million (5%) women</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of reproductive age live in countries that prohibit abortion altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activists and campaigners in many of these countries continue to fight to ease abortion restrictions. The hardline laws in El Salvador, which were introduced in 1998 after campaigning from conservative sectors of the Catholic Church, have led to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dozens of women being found guilty of &#8220;aggravated homicide,&#8221; even in cases of miscarriage. In March, thousands of Salvadoran women </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-60646938"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to demand that the ban be eased to allow abortions in cases of rape, when the fetus is not viable, or if the woman&#8217;s life is at risk.</span></p>
<h2><b>Countries with significant restrictions to abortion access</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 50 countries and regions permit abortions only when the woman&rsquo;s health is at risk. (Some refer only to physical health, while others include mental health.) These include Libya, Iran, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria. Others have exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or fetal abnormality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Brazil, for example, abortion is illegal except in cases of rape, risks to the life of the mother, or when the fetus has anencephaly&mdash;missing part of the brain or skull. In these cases, the woman needs approval from a doctor and at least three other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clinical experts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In August 2020, under President Bolsonaro&rsquo;s far-right government, a </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/21/brazil-revoke-regulation-curtailing-abortion-access"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Ministry regulation</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was introduced that requires medical professionals to collect evidence and report to the police anyone who seeks legal termination of a pregnancy after rape&mdash;which Human Rights Watch </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/21/brazil-revoke-regulation-curtailing-abortion-access"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to dissuade rape survivors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2021, a </span><a href="https://time.com/5905885/poland-abortion-ban-protest/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total ban on abortion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in Poland, only allowing the procedure in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother&rsquo;s life is at risk. The ban removed the exception for an abortion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in cases of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities&mdash;the grounds for which 98% of abortions in Poland were carried out in 2019.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mass demonstrations broke out in Poland in November 2021 following the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59206683"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">death of a woman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 22 weeks pregnant from sepsis, after her family said that life-saving treatment was delayed because of the ban. This month, the first pro-abortion activist to be charged under the new law </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/28/polish-woman-is-first-to-face-trial-for-violating-strict-abortion-law"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">went on trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for providing a pregnant woman with tablets to induce a miscarriage.</span></p>
<h2><b>Countries with broader access to abortion </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Reproductive Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in countries from Japan to India to Canada, as well as most of Europe and the U.S., more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of women of reproductive age </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?country=JPN&amp;category[1351]=1351"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can safely access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> abortion either on request or based on broad social or economic grounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-two countries, including France and Germany, allow for abortion subject to gestational time limits&mdash;the most common being 12 weeks. Even in these countries, there are often a variety of exceptions that allow abortions to take place later. In the U.K. for example, there is a 24-week limit on abortion, but if the fetus has a disability such as </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/woman-with-downs-syndrome-loses-uk-abortion-law-case"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down&rsquo;s Syndrome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the pregnancy can be terminated right up until birth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pro-life movements in countries like Poland and the U.S. have successfully lobbied for rollbacks in reproductive rights, other nations are making strides towards greater freedoms. In the past 18 months, Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico&mdash;traditionally conservative Catholic countries in Latin America&mdash;decriminalized abortions following waves of protests and campaigning by women&rsquo;s rights and pro-choice groups. The most recent, Colombia, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/colombia-legalises-abortion-in-move-celebrated-as-historic-victory-by-campaigners"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set the legal gestational limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 24 weeks of pregnancy in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes have inspired other pro-choice movements in the region&mdash;dubbed the </span><a href="https://time.com/5358823/argentina-abortion-vote-latin-america/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;green wave&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the colors worn by campaigners. Chile could become the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-abortion-debate-gets-key-place-constitution-redraft-2022-03-16/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first Latin American country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have the right to abortion enshrined in the country&rsquo;s constitution, pending the results of a vote later this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in Europe, Ireland drew worldwide attention after a May 2018 popular referendum that led to abortion being legalized up to 12 weeks, and limited circumstances beyond then. Before the change, thousands of Irish women would typically travel to nearby England fo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r the procedure every year, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Belfast-based journalism project </span><a href="https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/abortion-exported-women-travelling-for-terminations"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detail Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, New Zealand </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51955148"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decriminalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> abortion and extended the legal period to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Prior to that, two doctors were required to approve an abortion&mdash;and they would only do so if there was a &ldquo;serious danger&rdquo; to the woman&rsquo;s health. </span></p>

      <description><![CDATA[Sergei Lavrov has doubled down on comments about Hitler's 'Jewish blood' and said Israel supports the 'neo-Nazi' regime in Kyiv]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6172946"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6172946/sergei-lavrov-hitler-israel-ukraine/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a lesson in defending the indefensible, Sergei Lavrov is your man. Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister&rsquo;s comments broadcast Sunday that Hitler had &ldquo;Jewish blood&rdquo; and the &ldquo;most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews&rdquo; has shocked much of the world, especially Israel, which denounced an &#8220;unforgivable&#8221; lie that besmirched the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Lavrov doubled down on these sentiments Tuesday. In a</span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/russia-doubles-down-says-israel-supports-neo-nazi-regime-ukraine-1.10777197"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his ministry said that the subsequent uproar explained &ldquo;to a large extent why the current Israeli government supports the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavrov&rsquo;s original comments came after he was asked by an Italian TV station to explain his government&rsquo;s</span><a href="https://time.com/6154493/denazification-putin-ukraine-history-context/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;denazification&rdquo; justification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for invading Ukraine when the nation&rsquo;s President,</span><a href="https://time.com/6171277/volodymyr-zelensky-interview-ukraine-war/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">Volodymyr Zelensky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is himself Jewish and comes from a family </span><a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/in-israel-zelensky-tells-own-familys-holocaust-story.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partially wiped out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Holocaust.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His response&mdash;which included the assertion that &ldquo;there is no family without a monster&rdquo;&mdash;sparked a diplomatic spat with Russia&rsquo;s close partner Israel, which summoned Moscow&rsquo;s Ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, for a</span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/lapid-says-russian-envoy-subjected-to-tough-conversation-over-lavrov-comments/"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;tough conversation.&rdquo;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;His words are untrue and their intentions are wrong,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1521084831085600774"  target="_blank">said</a> Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. &ldquo;Using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Israel is one of the few western countries that hasn&rsquo;t imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion nor provided military aid to Ukraine, though it&#8217;s yet to be seen whether Lavrov&rsquo;s words will change that dynamic. At the very least, the spat prompted Israel for the first time to publicly condemn Russia&#8217;s claim that Zelensky is a Nazi.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, experts say it&rsquo;s wrong to simply attribute Lavrov&rsquo;s comments to simple blundering. Despite Russia&rsquo;s insistence that Ukraine must be &ldquo;denazified,&rdquo; the government of Vladimir Putin is all too willing to wield antisemitic conspiracies when they suit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Bullough, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looting Ukraine: How East and West Teamed Up to Steal a Country</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tells TIME that Lavrov&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;reflect the weirdly irrational conspiratorial mindset of most senior Russian officials.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, it&#8217;s rare for a senior Kremlin official to openly voice such views. &ldquo;At the moment, the Russian political class has crossed the red line,&rdquo; says Ilya Yablokov, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-Jewish conspiracy theories in Putin&#8217;s Russia.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Basically, they have no limitations and can talk about whatever they want.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><b>Russia&rsquo;s relations reset with Israel</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia experienced an uptick in mainstream anti-Jewish rhetoric as curbs on speech were <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181494/1/Anti-Jewish%20CTs%20in%20Putin%27s%20Russia%20IY%20FINAL%2010%20Jan.pdf"  target="_blank">rolled back</a>. However, since Putin came to power antisemitic hate speech and violence</span><a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/russian-anti-semitism-and-the-scape-goating-jews-the-dog-didnt-bark"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has dwindled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, from the mid-2000s, the Putin regime has leaned into the idea that the West is a singular enemy hellbent on destroying Russia. In support of this proposition, all manner of subplots percolate despite some blatant inherent contradictions, including of gay people, Nazis and Jews conspiring toward the same goal: Russia&rsquo;s downfall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Putin has avoided antisemitic language himself, and poses with Russia&rsquo;s chief Rabbi on Jewish holidays, he frequently cites antisemitic Russian thinkers in his speeches, such as</span><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/16/ivan-ilyin-putins-philosopher-of-russian-fascism/"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">philosopher Ivan Ilyin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1446515/1/U602440.pdf"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">historian Lev Gumilev</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Russia&rsquo;s President has even</span> <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/10/what-protests-putin-rides-with-night-wolves-bikers-in-crimea"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saddled up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with notorious antisemitic motorcycle gang the Night Wolves, to whom he</span><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russian-bikers-get-crimea-land-gift/27014307.html"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gave a slice of seized Crimea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Putin has also</span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/putin-praises-achievements-of-ultra-nationalist-anti-semitic-writer/"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">showered praise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on ultra-nationalist Russian writer Alexander Prokhanov, who, among many other rants, in 2012</span><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZrMyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=Alexander+Prokhanov+%E2%80%9CJews+took+over+the+world+and+are+using+their+power+for+evil.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tjfy-P_vYU&amp;sig=ACfU3U0nwq_NfJKTTcG3tLmUnACMIE7UCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJlqmamcP3AhXOSsAKHZ8lAGkQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Prokhanov%20%E2%80%9CJews%20took%20over%20the%20world%20and%20are%20using%20their%20power%20for%20evil.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that &ldquo;Jews took over the world and are using their power for evil.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it ultimately seems that in today&rsquo;s Russia, any conspiracy theory is a good one. When anti-Putin protest rock group</span><a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2012/07/31/pussy-riot-trial-punk-putin-and-protest/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pussy Riot stormed Moscow&rsquo;s Church of Christ the Saviour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, media allies of the president</span><a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181494/1/Anti-Jewish%20CTs%20in%20Putin%27s%20Russia%20IY%20FINAL%2010%20Jan.pdf"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">suggested that Jews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were possible instigators in a nefarious bid to destroy the Russian Orthodox Church, while Putin himself claimed </span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/putin-provokes-criticism-with-pussy-riot-anti-semitism-charge-1.5198750"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the group might be antisemitic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavrov&rsquo;s comments also echo a popular strand of antisemitism in eastern Europe that Jews have co-opted the Holocaust to seize the victimhood narrative from its &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; victims, who were Eastern European Christians. The Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s statement Tuesday that Israel&rsquo;s condemnation was &ldquo;anti-historical&rdquo; also suggests such a tactic. Whether that was unintentional, or a deliberate attempt to win approval in the Middle East, is unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, such sentiments work better for domestic consumption and Lavrov&rsquo;s very public broadcasting of revisionist Christian nationalism may score an own goal in Russia&rsquo;s military aims. Already, Moscow&rsquo;s relations with Jerusalem had been cooling as it</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-iran-moscow-tehran-5438506fba2505fbcd227f93c533e86d"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tilts toward Tehran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S, E.U. and other Western nations have also been pressing Israel to take a firmer position against Russia. In February, Israel condemned Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine as a &#8220;violation of the world order&#8221; but has stopped short of condemning Russia itself, which holds enormous influence in neighboring Syria, while still allowing Israel freely conduct its own operations against Tehran-backed forces there. Lavrov&rsquo;s comments may alter that relationship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Israel used to be a reliable partner for Russia,&rdquo; says Yablokov. &ldquo;But they have no reason to be loyal after these remarks. So strategically, it&#8217;s a big failure.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one would ever call the atmosphere on Antwerp&rsquo;s Hoveniersstraat relaxed. Each day, millions of euros worth of diamonds pass through the export offices and exchanges that line its 300 barricaded meters, and the traders who move along its length, clutching innocuous-looking plastic bags laden with gems, tend to eye outsiders with suspicion. But ever since the war in Ukraine began, Hoveniersstraat has been even more tense than usual. As the world&rsquo;s oldest and largest hub for the trade, it&mdash;and Antwerp as a whole&mdash;has held its breath each time the European Union has announced a new set of sanctions against Russia. And now, with a sixth round imminent, traders in Belgium&rsquo;s second largest city are again worried that their luck may soon run out.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia produces about 30% of the world&rsquo;s supply of diamonds. And one company, Alrosa, is responsible for mining roughly 90% of those. Partially owned by the Russian government, Alrosa has ties to Russia&rsquo;s military and nuclear industries, and is run by the son of a close Putin ally. Because of those connections, the U.S. and more recently the U.K., have put sanctions on Alrosa&rsquo;s chief executive, Sergey S. Ivanov, and banned imports of the country&rsquo;s diamonds as part of their efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But the European Union, headquartered in a country that is home to the oldest and largest diamond trading hub in the world, thus far has not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Peace is more valuable than diamonds,&rdquo; Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told the Belgian parliament when, speaking by video conference in late March, he urged the country to cut off imports. There is little doubt that a significant proportion of the Belgian trade goes to the Putin regime, which </span><a href="http://www.alrosa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-04-28-Investor-Presentation_ENG.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 33% of the company outright (regional governments control roughly another third). Alrosa puts a third of its production on the market through Antwerp, and 20 of its 58 clients are based there. Of the $4.2 billion that the company earned in 2021, $1.8 billion came from Belgian sales. Although that number is much smaller than the </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220307-1"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$104 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Russia earned in energy sales to Europe that year, it is higher than other Russian products the E.U. has already banned (like vodka, which generates $52 million). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamonds make up 5% of Belgium&rsquo;s exports, and generate about 30,000 jobs in Antwerp, which helps explain&mdash;along with some reported </span><a href="https://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/een-geslepen-lobby-hoe-een-russische-diamant-oligarch-zaken-kan-blijven-doen-vanuit-belgie~ba873060/?utm_campaign=shared_earned&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry lobbying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;why, after some initial exploratory discussions around the time the war started about, the European Union has yet to table a motion on their inclusion. &ldquo;In [the European] parliament we discussed it, and I myself was quite vocal about it because of the military connections,&rdquo; says Kathleen van Brempt, Belgian member of the European parliament for the Socialist party which, like the Greens, is in favor of the sanctions. But in the executive bodies where any embargo would be decided, she says, &ldquo;it has never to my knowledge been on the table so that they need to discuss and take a decision on it. And that, of course, is peculiar.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antwerp, a small port city with a population of half a million, has been closely associated with the gems since the 1500s. And although its importance as a hub for cutting and polishing diamonds long ago passed to other places&ndash;most notably India&ndash;it continued to control nearly all the world&rsquo;s trade until the 1980s.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 86% of all diamonds still pass through the city at least once in their journey from rough stone through cutting and polishing to final setting in a necklace or engagement ring. But as a trading center, the city now faces increasing competition, primarily from Mumbai and Dubai. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belgian prime minister Alexander de Croo has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> repeatedly said his country has not and will not block sanctions on the diamond trade if the European Commission decides to include the measure in one of its packages. The fact that it has not, say two sources within the Belgian government, is because members are convinced that those measures would be more damaging to Europe than to Russia.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6151766/u-s-sanctions-against-russia-gas-oil/" ><em>The Vital Missing Link in the U.S. Sanctions Against Russia</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That refrain&mdash;that it should hurt Russia more than it hurts Europe&mdash;has been repeated by leaders from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greece to <a href="https://time.com/magazine/europe/6171803/may-9th-2022-vol-199-no-17-europe-middle-east-and-africa/" >Germany</a> as an explanation for their opposition to oil and gas embargoes (which, nonetheless, appear to be the focus of the next round, which may arrive this week.week). Although she disagrees with that argument, van Brempt notes that there&rsquo;s a certain impact of an oil and gas ban that does not apply to luxury goods. &ldquo;Energy at least affects everyone: consumers, family, industry,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But diamonds?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet when it comes to the gemstones, says Tom Neys, spokesman for the Antwerp World Diamond Center (AWDC), sanctions may not hurt Russia at all. &ldquo;Some politicians say, &lsquo;we need to bleed ourselves to make the other bleed.&rsquo; But in this case, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not even cutting the other side,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Russia does not suffer from this sanction, it will be able to earn the exact $1.8 billion somewhere else. Dubai has already stated that very clearly.&rdquo; And unlike gas, which requires massive infrastructure to transport and thus cannot be readily diverted to other buyers, diamonds are easily moved. &ldquo;All diamonds of five carats and above, from a whole year&rsquo;s production, you could fit in a basketball,&rdquo; Neys says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And where those diamonds will end up, he adds, undermines decades of work to clean up the industry.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 20 years ago, the diamond trade responded to concerns that rebel groups in Africa were using the sale of rough diamonds mined there to finance conflicts that undermined legitimate governments by creating a regulatory trade scheme called the Kimberley Process (KP). Supported by a broad coalition of governments (including the E.U., the U.S., South Africa, Zimbabwe, China and Russia), civil actors, and the diamond industry the KP has been largely successful in meeting its immediate goal of eliminating conflict or &lsquo;blood&rsquo; diamonds, and helped spur a transition in traditionally secretive Antwerp toward greater transparency and due diligence regarding the conditions in which diamonds are produced.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/blood-diamonds/" ><em>Blood Diamonds</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanctions, according to the AWDC, threaten all that. If the diamonds Russia would normally sell to Europe now go instead to other diamond hubs, says Neys, it will cause the loss not only of 10,000 jobs but those ethical gains as well. &ldquo;If 30% of the market goes to Dubai, then you have thrown away 20 years of transparency and compliance and due diligence into the garbage can and you have no control anymore. We are opening the door to money laundering. We are opening the door to financing terrorism in large volumes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hans Merket, a researcher at the International Peace Information Service in Antwerp, acknowledges that Belgium does a better job than other hubs of ensuring ethical diamond production. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that the controls in Antwerp are unrivaled, and that there&#8217;s no other trading center that has this level of control,&rdquo; he says. But in </span><a href="https://ipisresearch.be/publication/russian-diamonds-and-the-war-in-ukraine/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of April, he draws a direct line between Alrosa and the Russian military, noting that in 1997 the company sponsored a submarine, and paid to maintain it in &ldquo;combat-ready&rdquo; position. The submarine was later used in the 2014 annexation of Crimea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that the Kimberley Process, which includes the Russian Federation, has repeatedly rejected past attempts to expand its definition of conflict diamonds, Merket said in an interview with TIME that it was highly unlikely the organization would now restrict gems whose sale was funding a state-sponsored war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he says, Belgium should again assume the leadership role and not only propose E.U. sanctions, but, together with the U.S., persuade other countries to also cease trading Russian diamonds. &ldquo;There are only four big players today,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And two of them, the E.U. and the U.S., could coordinate and put pressure on the other two, India and the UAE. Belgian politicians and the sector say they only want sanctions if they&rsquo;re internationally coordinated. But then they need to start to coordinate them, rather than hiding and waiting to see what&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important step, Merket points out, would be to devise a mechanism to make the origin of any diamond readily traceable. While large, extremely valuable stones often come with a certificate of origin, the rest, or roughly 90% of jewelry-quality diamonds, are traded in large parcels where stones from any number of places are mixed. When certificates of origin do exist, they only apply to rough diamonds; once a stone is cut or polished or otherwise &ldquo;substantially transformed,&rdquo; as the US customs department puts it, it becomes the export of the country where the process took place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s why even companies like Tiffany&rsquo;s or Pandora, which have said they will stop buying Russian rough diamonds, cannot assure customers that the gems weren&rsquo;t mined there. Two laOne trade organization in the US, Jewelers of America, has urged its 8,000 members to go beyond current sanctions until sovereignty is restored to Ukraine. &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the complexities of the ethical and legal issues attendant to conducting business with Russian counterparties, JA is advising its members to cease the purchase of goods used in jewelry that have emanated from Russia and benefit the Russian government, regardless of where they are cut and/or manufactured,&rdquo; association president and CEO, David Bonaparte said in a statement to TIME.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an office on the upper floor of the AWDC&rsquo;s headquarters, Neys acknowledges that opposition to Russian sanctions is, given the horrors in Ukraine,&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not a sympathetic story. But it is a realistic one,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very easy to break something down, but building something is much harder. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done during the last 20 years, built something that makes sure that in the end, the customer gets a product that is correct.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the definition of correct may be changing. In the blocks surrounding Hoveniersstraat, the importers and wholesalers give way to dozens of jewelry stores, some of them plush and intimidatingly formal; others bare and dark enough that they could pass for shoe repair stalls. Not far from the train station, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Montero and his wife Lidia Gonz&aacute;lez stood outside the glittering shop window of one. The Spanish couple had come to Antwerp for the art, but had stopped to admire the jewelry. &ldquo;I would definitely want to know where they come from, because I don&rsquo;t want to buy diamonds from Russia,&rdquo; Montero said. &ldquo;In my country, we feel a lot of solidarity with Ukraine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Correction, May 3</strong></p>
<p><em>The original version of this story misstated the number of jobs generated in Antwerp from the diamond trade; it is 30,000, not 10,000.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are few keener eyewitnesses to British history than London&rsquo;s Royal Mint Court. When, in 1348, the Black Death scythed down a quarter of all Londoners, thousands of bodies were tipped into a vast plague pit on the site. That burial ground was consecrated as a Cistercian Abbey, before becoming a Royal Navy chandlering yard, and later a tobacco warehouse. It was only in 1809 that the site adopted the function that today still bears its name, when the smelting of silver and gold coinage announced Britain as the world&rsquo;s predominant military and financial superpower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those days are long gone, of course, though the Royal Mint Court&mdash;tucked inside London&rsquo;s raffish East End, gazing toward Tower Bridge and the 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century Tower of London&mdash;continues to serve as a barometer of our time. Now, however, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s rising superpower that will write the next chapter: China, which purchased the site for $250 million in 2018 to house its new U.K. Embassy, its largest in Europe and, in a perhaps notable augury, almost a third bigger than London&rsquo;s new U.S. Embassy four miles away. A </span><a href="https://development.towerhamlets.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=DCAPR_135435"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 700,000 sq ft redevelopment was submitted in June, but planning permission has yet to be granted, meaning it will likely take several years before the building is fit for occupation.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upgrade was needed to create a &ldquo;welcoming public face for China,&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/china-picks-david-chipperfield-to-design-new-london-embassy"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the architect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commissioned in 2020</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to lead the refurbishment, with office space and staff accommodation far exceeding its current premises in Marylebone. Locals have been less welcoming, however, and ever since the sale have voiced</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">their opposition to the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ensconcing themselves in this storied landmark given Beijing&rsquo;s</span><a href="https://time.com/6078961/china-ccp-anniversary-identity/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">ongoing abuses against Uyghur Muslims, Tibetans and the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It is disgraceful,&rdquo; local community activist Mohammad Rakib tells TIME. &ldquo;The government of China should not have been able to purchase such a prominent site. [By] sticking an unobstructed Chinese flag by Tower Bridge and the Tower of London&#8230; the authorities may as well have allowed neo-Nazis to occupy the building and fly a swastika from it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the groundswell of opposition that last year local politicians for Tower Hamlets borough, where Royal Mint Court is situated, </span><a href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/documents/s182629/Labour%20Group%20amendment%20-%20Chinese%20embassy%20motion.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed a cross-party motion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of renaming nearby roads in commemoration of CCP atrocities, such as &ldquo;Tiananmen Square, Hong Kong Road, Uyghur Court and Tibet Hill.&rdquo; Councilor Rabina Khan, who proposed the motion, said it was to &ldquo;stand up against the CCP&rsquo;s human rights violations.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent weeks, China&rsquo;s</span><a href="https://time.com/6163807/china-russia-putin-ukraine/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">support for Russia&rsquo;s bloody invasion of Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has only galvanized opposition. &ldquo;For decades, China and Russia have collaborated on human rights abuses and suppression of civil liberties,&rdquo; says Finn Lau, founder of pro-democracy advocacy group Hong Kong Liberty, who had previously helped organize a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/finnlau_cd/status/1438119037972598786?lang=en-GB"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">joint demonstration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the embassy together with Tibetan and <a href="https://time.com/5847184/uyghur-human-rights-policy-act-china/" >Uyghur activists</a>. &ldquo;And when you look at the timeline, Russia deliberately avoided invading Ukraine during the Winter Olympics [in Beijing], so they clearly had a deal.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approached by TIME, a spokesperson for China&rsquo;s U.K. embassy declined to comment on the controversy. However, in a letter to Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs last year, China&rsquo;s outgoing Ambassador to the U.K. Liu Xiaoming said that the alleged abuses highlighted by the proposed street name changes were &ldquo;all lies fabricated by a few irresponsible politicians and media from the West.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Sino-U.K. relations are ostensibly set by central governments, Britain&rsquo;s traditions of free speech provide myriad outlets for all strata of British society to register objections. (And not just regarding China, as any fans of the</span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55694910"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump baby blimp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that trolled the former U.S. President on his U.K. visits can attest.) But popular protest is an aspect of democracy that the notoriously thin-skinned Chinese state, which under strongman President Xi Jinping has become increasingly ideological and centralized, has long struggled to grasp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Gesture politics like renaming streets won&#8217;t have any real effect in terms of how the Chinese behave,&rdquo; says Prof. Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London. &ldquo;But it will have a very strong negative effect on China&rsquo;s relationship with the U.K. generally.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spat has underscored the difficulties democracies face when engaging a regime that they are economically reliant on but whose actions are wholly unacceptable by the public they represent. China&rsquo;s relationship with the U.K. had already been on a downward spiral following the</span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55124236"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusion of Chinese telecoms firm Huawei from Britain&rsquo;s 5G network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on national security grounds, as well as growing</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/26/chinas-nuclear-power-firm-could-be-blocked-from-uk-projects"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls to block China&rsquo;s state nuclear agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its power grid. And now the war in Ukraine has given China skeptics fresh impetus to draw focus to the new embassy proposal. On April 29, a spokesman for China&#8217;s Foriegn Ministry </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-29/china-calls-russia-relationship-a-new-model-for-the-world"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ties with Russia as &#8220;a new model of international relations.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;China is capable of doing something the old Soviet Union couldn&#8217;t do, which is to threaten us economically and militarily at the same time,&rdquo; says Iain Duncan Smith, former leader of the Conservative Party and a supporter of the Tower Hamlets motion. &ldquo;Today, we&#8217;re dealing with Russia, but we&#8217;ve got an even bigger problem coming down the track, which is China.&rdquo;</span></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Street name politics</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing the names of streets surrounding consular premises is a perennial flashpoint.</span><a href="https://time.com/4226998/liu-xiaobo-washington-dc-china-embassy/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">A congressional proposal in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to rename International Place NW outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington D.C. to &ldquo;Liu Xiaobo Plaza,&rdquo; after the now deceased democracy activist and 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner, only failed after the Obama Administration promised to veto the move. In 2020, Congress proposed</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/us-senators-propose-renaming-street-outside-chinese-embassy-after-wuhan-whistleblower"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">renaming that same street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Wuhan whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, China has its own history of doing the same thing. Following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, the Soviet Embassy in Beijing sat for a while on &ldquo;Oppose Revisionism Street,&rdquo; though the name reverted after the Cultural Revolution. Another road in the Beijing&rsquo;s foreign legation quarter was</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-28683?utm_source=pocket_mylist"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">renamed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Anti-Imperialist Street&rdquo; around the same time, while there was an official campaign to have any mail set to Hong Kong to be addressed to &ldquo;Expel-the-Imperialists-City,&rdquo; which the territory&rsquo;s postal service even acquiesced to service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, despite the Tower Hamlets motion, the reality is that renaming central London streets that contain heritage buildings and possibly billions of dollars of real estate is not that simple. However, there is a small unadopted slip-road right outside Royal Mint Court that currently houses a taxi rank. The council could very easily &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; this 50-yard strip of tarmac and give it its own symbolic name without disrupting nearby stakeholders. The campaign has now focused on this relatively simple task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tower Hamlets Councilor Andrew Wood says &ldquo;Tiananmen Square&rdquo; would be his preference for the new road&rsquo;s name, since while passers-by would immediately recognize the reference to the</span><a href="https://time.com/5600363/china-tiananmen-30-years-later/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">1989 massacre of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &ldquo;for the Chinese to object would mean explaining why it&#8217;s appropriate for a square in Beijing, but not here.&rdquo; Not least since, according to the CCP&rsquo;s official scrubbed narrative, &ldquo;everything was fine and dandy and nothing really happened there,&rdquo; he adds.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/5600363/china-tiananmen-30-years-later/" ><em>How the Tiananmen Square Massacre Changed China Forever</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, critics argue that it is beyond the remit of a local council to meddle with foreign relations. Indeed, Wood says that he opposed a 2015 council motion</span><a href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=63268"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to recognize breakaway African state Somaliland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that very reason. However, he argues that the embassy case is very different, given the Beijing government&rsquo;s actions, particularly its erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, are having a direct effect here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was under an agreement that the territory would enjoy significant autonomy for 50 years in an arrangement dubbed &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems.&rdquo; However, Beijing&rsquo;s arrest of pro-democracy activists and imposition of a</span><a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" > <span style="font-weight: 400;">draconian new National Security Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shredded that accord, prompting the U.K. government last year to launch a new visa program to potentially allow almost three million Hong Kongers to</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-expands-eligibility-hong-kong-visa-offer-2022-02-24/"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for a five-year British visa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a route to citizenship beyond. (In early March, 103,900 Hong Kongers had already applied via the scheme.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the largest single origin of overseas property owners in Tower Hamlets is Hong Kong. &ldquo;So for us, it&#8217;s not just the embassy that&#8217;s an issue,&rdquo; says Wood, who has been helping some new arrivals from Hong Kong resolve school placement issues. &ldquo;Our community demographics are actually changing because of the actions of the Chinese government.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China&rsquo;s abuses against Muslims are likewise not abstract events here. The borough has the highest percentage of Muslim residents in the U.K. with 38% either practicing Islam or of Muslim heritage, according to the latest 2011 census data. It is home to 47 mosques, including East London Mosque, Europe&rsquo;s largest, which has welcomed worshippers for over a century. Royal Mint Court also sits toward the end of Cable Street, which is steeped in anti-racist lore after East End residents drove back a march of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley&rsquo;s blackshirts in 1936.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Embassy represents the country, and that country is committing a genocide, terrorizing Tibetans and eradicating democracy in Hong Kong,&rdquo; says Rahima Mahmut, a former Tower Hamlets resident and the U.K. director of the World Uyghur Congress. She was also present at the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. &ldquo;So the least that we can do is remind people of the human rights abuses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><strong>A hub for espionage?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional concern is the nature of work that will be carried out inside Royal Mint Court. On Nov. 20, Richard Moore, the chief of British foreign intelligence service MI6, told the</span><a href="https://www.iiss.org/events/2021/11/human-intelligence-digital-age"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">International Institute for Strategic Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in London that Beijing is mounting &ldquo;large-scale espionage operations&rdquo; against the U.K. and its allies in order to steal technology and distort political decision-making. Calling the Chinese threat his &ldquo;single greatest priority,&rdquo; Moore said Chinese operatives were instructed to &ldquo;monitor and attempt to exercise undue influence over the Chinese diaspora.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, British domestic security service MI5 issued a rare warning that a 59-year-old legal adviser to the Chinese Embassy named Christine Lee was in fact an agent for the CCP&rsquo;s foreign influence wing, the United Front Work Department. The statement alleged that Lee, a political networker who even received an award in 2019 from the U.K. prime minister&rsquo;s office, has for almost three decades attempted to influence lawmakers and political parties by facilitating financial donations from China. (A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson</span><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/british-intelligence-shines-light-on-chinese-spy-hiding-in-plain-sight-/6397338.html"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the claims, saying that &ldquo;certain people may have watched too many &#8216;007&#8217; movies.&rdquo;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And China&rsquo;s growing diplomatic presence is raising eyebrows. In 2010, there were 94 Chinese officials in the U.K. on diplomatic passports. That rose to</span><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/china-attempts-to-extend-influence-by-sending-more-diplomats-hvvv2jls5?utm_source=pocket_mylist"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">116 in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while today there are</span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk#full-publication-update-history"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">121 in London alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (China also has consulates in Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester.) The purpose of these officials is unclear. In 2019, a U.K. foreign affairs select committee</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/05/alarming-chinese-meddling-at-uk-universities-exposed-in-report"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found &ldquo;alarming evidence&rdquo; of Chinese interference on British University campuses, some of which had been coordinated by the Chinese Embassy. &ldquo;That the Chinese government trying to infiltrate us is a given,&rdquo; says Tsang. &ldquo;It is a Leninist party state and so infiltrates when and where it can. They are not being paid to do nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence is also a problem locally. The Tower Hamlet motion to change street names noted that the Chinese Embassy had written to some neighborhood schools to explore opportunities for potential collaboration, and expressed worried that the CCP promoting its own aberrant ideas about ethnic harmony may chafe with the borough&rsquo;s &ldquo;proud history of standing up for each other as one community and celebrating our differences.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, there&rsquo;s a huge question mark over what benefit residents get out of having the Embassy in their midst. It&rsquo;s certainly not economic. Were an office building to take over the site, the council could charge a Community Infrastructure Levy on the square footage to help renovate transport links and so on. However, because the borough has never had an embassy before, diplomatic usages weren&rsquo;t included in the levy categories and so are currently exempt. Having the Chinese Embassy may possibly attract more Chinese investment, though given the borough already hosts the U.K. headquarters of HSBC and the Bank of China in its freewheeling Docklands financial center, any boost is likely to be incremental. &ldquo;So we probably lose out financially slightly from the [Embassy] as compared to an office use as was originally planned,&rdquo; says Wood. In a report published in January, Tower Hamlets Council&rsquo;s director of community safety Ann Corbett also warned that protests around the embassy building are &ldquo;inevitably likely to be very disruptive to residents and traffic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Bulldozing history</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning permission for the site refurbishment still hasn&rsquo;t been granted and therein lies another raft of problems. Due to national security concerns, installing an embassy is not like building an office block&mdash;many nations prefer to fly in developers from their homeland given that local contractors could install bugs or other vulnerabilities. At the very least, the building is gutted and secured by a, typically concrete, hard shell to encase the most sensitive work areas. But the Royal Mint Court has centuries of historical artifacts buried deep beneath its current Greek Revival portico. Apart from the skeletons of Black Death dead, there are the original foundations of St Mary Graces Abbey and countless artifacts of &ldquo;enormous historical importance,&rdquo; says Tower Hamlets Councilor Peter Golds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The last thing I want is the Chinese government digging a great big hole in the ground and picking through historic remains that date from the 14th century,&rdquo; says Golds. &ldquo;And then plowing through the graves of several thousand Londoners who died in the Black Death.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How this invaluable history can be preserved whilst meeting the security requirements for the famously paranoid Chinese state has not yet been ascertained. It&rsquo;s incumbent upon Tower Hamlets to find a solution that works for all. Under British law, while planning approval is a local matter, the decision can be &ldquo;called in&rdquo; by either the Mayor of London or central government should they deem necessary. Given already frosty relations with the world&rsquo;s number two economy, the British government may decide this is not a fight worth their while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, the council should have final say on the name of that unadopted road, be it Tiananmen Square, Uyghur Court or something else entirely. And some remain optimistic. Such is the strength of the local community that politician Wood is betting against the Chinese proving a corrupting influence here, suggesting that things may in fact manifest the other way around. &ldquo;Tower Hamlets is one of the most multi-ethnic, international places in the globe, let alone London,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So I think it would be good for the Chinese to see how that works.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Palau&rsquo;s waters contain some of the world&rsquo;s richest marine biodiversity.<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/hawksbill-turtle"  target="_blank"> Critically endangered</a> <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/hawksbill-turtle"  target="_blank">hawksbill turtles</a> and <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/humphead-wrasse"  target="_blank">endangered Napoleon wrasse</a>, which can grow up to six feet long and are known for the distinctive bulge on their foreheads, cruise through reefs home to hundreds of species of coral.</p>
<p>The country, an archipelago of over 300 pristine tropical islands popping up out of the Pacific, has tried hard to protect its natural gifts.<a href="https://flyandsea.com/first-shark-sanctuary-in-palau/"  target="_blank"> In 2009</a>, it forbade the commercial fishing of sharks, creating the world&rsquo;s first national shark sanctuary. Species like dugongs and bumphead parrotfish are <a href="https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/2020/03/10/conservationists-nix-palau-legislators-proposal-to-end-the-26-year-old-fishing-ban-on-en#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Protection%20Act%20of%201994%20passed%20by%20the%204th,plants%20other%20than%20marine%20birds."  target="_blank">protected</a>. Tourists have to pay a $100 green fee on entry to the country to support local conservation, and sign a pledge written by the children of Palau to &ldquo;tread lightly, act kindly, and explore mindfully.&rdquo;<a href="https://time.com/5447739/palau-sunscreen-ban-coral/" > Sunscreen</a> that has ingredients that are toxic to reefs is banned.<br />

<p>But perhaps its most ambitious conservation initiative is the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS). Any kind of extractive activity, including fishing, has been banned in the PNMS, an area bigger than California, which comprises 80% of Palau&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), since January 2020. Not only can so-called<a href="https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1514684743329144832"  target="_blank"> marine protected areas (MPAs)</a> safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems but they are also important for the fight against climate change; they can prevent stores of seafloor carbon from being released from activities like trawling or resource extraction.</p>
<p>But the future of the PNMS&mdash;one of the largest marine protected areas<a href="https://mpatlas.org/large-mpas/"  target="_blank"> in the world</a>&mdash;looks uncertain. The government is now considering reducing the size of the PNMS to as little as 30% of the EEZ, in an attempt to increase economic activity to ease the hit COVID-19 has had on the country&rsquo;s finances.</p>
<p>Palau&rsquo;s struggle highlights questions of justice that countries around the world are facing as they grapple with how to balance biodiversity protection and climate action with economic growth: What contributions should developing nations have to make to protect biodiversity and the climate? Should they take a hit to their economic development, when climate change caused mostly by the world&#8217;s largest emitters, is the source of many of the ocean&#8217;s problems? Meanwhile, a global goal of protecting 30% of the world&rsquo;s oceans means Palau is doing far more for ocean protection than most countries.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Save our sanctuary!&#8221;</h2>
<p>The plan to reduce the size of the PNMS has sparked heated debate in Palau. As the<a href="https://time.com/6166419/john-kerry-ocean-climate-change-interview/" > Our Ocean conference</a> convened in Palau in mid-April, bringing together hundreds of officials, activists, and businesspeople from around the world to discuss ocean protection, a dozen or so youth activists, environmentalists, and fishermen gathered outside to protest the potential scaling down of the PNMS. &ldquo;Save our sanctuary! We know you can do it,&rdquo; they shouted as diplomats arrived in their black SUVs. &ldquo;Fishermen Want the Sanctuary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;People Not Profit,&rdquo; their signs read.</p>

<p>One petition to protect the sanctuary has gathered<a href="https://www.change.org/p/savemysanctuary-help-stop-the-destruction-of-one-of-the-world-s-largest-mpas"  target="_blank"> 2,600 signatures</a> (about 14% of Palau&rsquo;s population). The country&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.palaugov.pw/executive-branch/council-of-chiefs/"  target="_blank">Council of Chiefs</a>, a group of traditional chiefs that advises the president, <a href="https://islandtimes.org/chiefs-weigh-in-favor-of-keeping-the-pnms-as-is/"  target="_blank"> opposes the plan to roll back the sanctuary,</a> which was designed with the indigenous practice of &ldquo;bul&rdquo;-which calls for a moratorium on the use of resources to prevent damage to a habitat or species&ndash;in mind. Former president Tommy Remengesau Jr. has blasted the move to rollback one of his signature policies, and has said <a href="https://pina.com.fj/2022/04/12/former-palau-leader-fears-marine-sanctuary-act-could-be-ditched/"  target="_blank">the foreign fishing lobby</a> was trying to influence national leaders to allow them to fish in Palau again. Several local NGOs, the Palau Chamber of Commerce, a local fishing start-up fishing company, and some conservation societies showed up at a March public hearing to oppose the plan, according to the <a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank">Island <em>Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>But Palau&rsquo;s President Surangel Whipps Jr., who took office a year after the PNMS was enacted, and several others in the government want to reduce the size of the PNMS. Whipps says he&rsquo;s committed to protecting at least 30% of the EEZ, but the country needs to find a better balance between protection and production. Tourism, which accounted for almost<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/palau-to-welcome-first-tourists-in-a-year-with-presidential-escort"  target="_blank"> 50% of Palau&rsquo;s GDP</a> before the pandemic, has not yet made a comeback in a meaningful way. Palau&rsquo;s GDP dropped by 17% in 2021, according to the<a href="https://www.adb.org/countries/palau/economy"  target="_blank"> Asia Development Bank.</a> The Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture, and Environment has reported that <a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank">$1.8 million</a> has been lost from banning fishing. Environmentalists argue that the PNMS has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in grants and donations to support conservation, but some in the government argue that money goes to non-profits, not to fund things like state governments, education, medical care, and the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These kids protesting&#8230;they say, &lsquo;We want 80% and you&rsquo;re bad, Mr. President. You&rsquo;re bad because you&rsquo;re trying to come up with a better plan,&rsquo;&rdquo; Whipps says. &ldquo;But they forget that what their protest[s are] saying is, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want money for our school lunch program. We don&rsquo;t want money to pay our teachers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipps says implementing the PNMS led to unintended consequences, like the closure of a foreign-run fishery that paid taxes, employed workers, ran a local processing facility, and provided Palau with cheap sources of protein by selling lower-grade tuna and other bycatch locally. After the ban,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/palaus-marine-sanctuary-backfires-leading-to-increased-consumption-of-reef-fish"  target="_blank"> foreign commercial fishing vessels</a> that could fish offshore for species like skipjack and yellowfin left Palau&rsquo;s waters, causing a shortage of tuna in the local market.</p>
<p>Now, he says, the country needs to do marine spatial planning&mdash;a process of analyzing and deciding what activities should be allowed in what space&mdash;to determine how to use their resources properly. &#8220;A lot of times people get hung up on numbers&mdash;80%, 30%. It shouldn&#8217;t be about numbers, it should be about the right size, the most effective way to do it,&#8221; he says. &ldquo;And then when you have these areas, they gotta be durable, and they gotta get the financing that sustains them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But some Palauans say that&rsquo;s short-sighted, and some local fishermen say they are making progress on developing local tuna fishing capabilities following the departure of foreign fishing boats. &ldquo;We have just started and we are growing. It is only the pandemic that is keeping us from expanding&#8230;Again, please don&rsquo;t open to foreign fishing boats,&#8221; Elia Yobech, who works for Belau Offshore Fisheries Inc., and fishes for tuna, among other species, said at a public hearing on the matter in March, according to the<a href="https://islandtimes.org/large-crowd-show-strong-opposition-to-re-opening-pnms/"  target="_blank"> Island <em>Times</em></a>.</p>

<h2>&#8220;A much higher standard than the rest of the world?&#8221;</h2>
<p>Only about 2% of the world&rsquo;s oceans are covered by <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/marine-protected-areas-and-climate-change"  target="_blank">&ldquo;no-take&rdquo; MPAs</a> that ban fishing, mining, drilling, and other extractive industries, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But there is an international push to protect 30% of the world&rsquo;s land and ocean by 2030 (commonly referred to as &ldquo;30&#215;30&#8243;). The ocean is an important heat and carbon sink, helping to keep the global climate stable. Without this sort of protection, increasing water temperature and ocean acidification could be disastrous for much of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Some Pacific island nations, like Palau, have been way ahead of these efforts. Indeed, Palau has already set aside 80% of its waters, while the rest of the world is aiming to protect only 30%. And some are wondering why developing countries should suffer economically just for doing more for the planet than those wealthier than them. &ldquo;That&#8217;s a question that some of us have asked ourselves,&rdquo; says Steven Victor, Palau&#8217;s Minister of Fisheries, Agriculture and Environment. &ldquo;Why are we being held to a much higher standard than the rest of the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Victor says the 80% no-take zone may be constraining efforts to build the local fishery sector, which is important to improve food security, and questions what real impact the PNMS has on protecting global tuna stocks, a highly migratory species, unless others are making similar efforts. &#8220;To this day, no one can really articulate what we are trying to protect within 80%. We&#8217;re simply saying, &#8216;The bigger the better.&#8217; But at whose expense? The expense of the people of Palau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whipps agrees that it is inequitable for Palau to restrict itself so much. &#8220;Is the warming water Palau&#8217;s fault? No. It&#8217;s large emitters. So if you can&#8217;t change your behavior, then I guess you better come to the table and pay for what you can&#8217;t if you can&#8217;t change,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Palau is a member of<a href="https://time.com/6137289/climate-change-responsibility/" > the Commission of Small Island States (COSIS) on Climate Change and International Law</a>, a group that seeks to hold the world&#8217;s largest emitters accountable for climate change-related destruction; COSIS aims to unite small-island countries to pursue climate judicial action through international courts.</p>

<p>But domestically, there are questions over who would benefit from opening the EEZ.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people whose lives are dependent on the ocean are actually benefiting from the design of the MPA right now, but they&#8217;re not at the discussion table,&#8221; says Ann Singeo, of the Ebiil Society, an environmental NGO that works with local fishermen.</p>
<p>She says Palau&#8217;s fishermen have already noticed a positive impact from the PNMS. &#8220;They&#8217;re catching [fish] 2-5 miles outside of the reef now, before they&#8217;d have to go 15-20 miles out,&#8221; she says, explaining that only people who can afford fuel or have a certain type of vessel can travel this distance. &#8220;This bill is just basically going to give away the waters to foreign corporations again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Palauans believe that ocean protection is in their country&rsquo;s DNA, in line with its <a href="https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/palau-chiefs-say-costs-outweigh-gains-from-opening-marine-sanctuary"  target="_blank">cultural and traditional values</a>, and that as a small-island developing state (SIDS) it should lead on climate efforts, given that SIDS are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Science tells us that our world has to fully-protect at least 30% of our world&rsquo;s oceans by 2030 for life on our planet earth to survive. And yet we are nowhere near that target,&#8221; Palau&#8217;s Council of Chiefs wrote in a statement that appeared in the <em>Ti Belau</em> newspaper during the Our Ocean conference. They added: &#8220;Without MPAs like PNMS, it is not only Palau who is at risk but our entire world.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the muddled debate over the future of Palau&rsquo;s sanctuary continues, that much is clear: The future of the oceans is at risk, and it puts the world&rsquo;s climate goals in peril. But to truly protect the world&rsquo;s oceans, the rest of the world will need to step up its action.</p>

      <title>Amid Shanghai’s COVID-19 Surge, a Nursing Home Resident Was Sent to the Morgue While Still Alive</title>

<p>A Shanghai nursing home resident was mistakenly taken to the morgue while still alive, state media reported, as the city&rsquo;s Covid-19 outbreak and prolonged lockdown stretch aged-care and medical facilities to breaking point.</p>
<p>The municipal government confirmed the incident and said it has launched an investigation, local media reported. While the nursing home apologized, the error has triggered widespread anger and condemnation among Chinese people, according to discussions on social media.</p>
<p>The mistake comes as Shanghai&rsquo;s lockdown enters its fifth week and new COVID cases remain in the thousands each day. The tough restrictions and compulsory isolation of all virus cases and close contacts have created havoc in the city of 25 million, with people unable to access essential medical care. Most of the more than 400 deaths in the latest wave have been elderly people with underlying health conditions, with reports that some nursing homes weren&rsquo;t reporting deaths.<br />

<p>While it remains unclear whether the person was infected with Covid or vaccinated, the low inoculation rate among China&rsquo;s elderly remains the country&rsquo;s Achilles heel in the fight against the pandemic. In Shanghai, just 62% of residents over 60 years of age have been fully vaccinated, and only 15% of the population aged over 80 have received two shots. The average age of deaths reported Sunday was 84, according to the local government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is murder,&rdquo; one Weibo user wrote among a raft of other angry posts. &ldquo;The confidence crisis in the city is getting too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nursing care resident has been sent to the hospital for treatment and their vital signs are stabilizing, local media reported. The Bureau of Civil Affairs in the Putuo district where the home is located said it will handle the accident seriously and disclose the findings after the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with the epidemic, or any kind of normal negligence and irresponsibility, this is a serious dereliction of duty that almost led to death,&rdquo; Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of the Communist Party backed <em>Global Times</em> newspaper and an influential commentator, <a href="https://weibo.com/1989660417/Lr7cS42qZ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his personal Weibo account.</p>

<p>LVIV, Ukraine &mdash; Hollywood actress and U.N. humanitarian Angelina Jolie made a surprise visit to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, the Lviv regional governor said on Telegram.</p>
<p>According to Maksym Kozytskyy, Jolie &mdash; who has been a UNHCR Special Envoy for Refugees since 2011 &mdash; had come to speak with displaced people who have found refuge in Lviv, including children undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April.</p>
<p>The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming Russian offensive, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very moved by (the children&rsquo;s) stories,&rdquo; Kozytskyy wrote. &ldquo;One girl was even able to privately tell Ms. Jolie about a dream she&rsquo;d had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said Jolie also visited a boarding school, talk with students and took photos with them, adding &#8220;she promised she would come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Kozytskyy, Jolie also met with evacuees arriving at Lviv&rsquo;s central railway station, as well as with Ukrainian volunteers providing the new arrivals with medical help and counseling,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The visit was a surprise to us all,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Plenty of people who saw Ms. Jolie in the Lviv region could not believe that it was really her. But since Feb. 24, Ukraine has shown the entire world that there are plenty of incredible things here.&rdquo;</p>

      <title>Evacuations Underway at Steel Plant in Mariupol</title>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6172461/mariupol-steel-plant-evacuation/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine &mdash; A long-awaited effort to evacuate people from a steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was underway Sunday, the United Nations said, while <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-congress-adam-schiff-b26d709f1e5e3cba71c3b67e47638746"  target="_blank">U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> revealed she visited Ukraine&#8217;s president to show unflinching American support for the country&#8217;s defense against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu told The Associated Press that the operation to bring people out of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done with the International Committee of the Red Cross and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials.</p>
<p>As many as 100,000 people are believed to still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians who were hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant &mdash; the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Abreu called the situation &ldquo;very complex&rdquo; and would not give further details. Like other evacuations, success of the mission in Mariupol depended on Russia and its forces, deployed along a long series of checkpoints before reaching Ukrainian ones.</p>
<p>Zaporizhzhia, a city about 141 miles (227 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol, is the expected destination of the evacuation effort. Zaporizhzhia was the destination of Mariupol residents who managed to flee the city on their own when previous Red Cross- and Ukrainian-organized evacuations had to be called off due to ongoing shelling or concerns about route safety.</p>
<p>The U.N. said the convoy to evacuate civilians started on Friday, travelling some 140 miles (230 kilometers) before reaching the plant in Mariupol on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a tweet Sunday afternoon that the first group of about 100 people was headed to Ukrainian-controlled territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll meet them in Zaporizhzhia. Grateful to our team! Now they, together with #UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a team with Doctors Without Borders was at a reception center for displaced people in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for the U.N. convoy&rsquo;s arrival, if successful. Stress, exhaustion and low supplies of food have likely weakened the health of civilians who have been trapped underground at the steel plant.</p>
<p>People fleeing Russian-occupied areas have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-boris-johnson-business-europe-58cfba68facfcc8b10d1e842e9cef6c4"  target="_blank">Russia&#8217;s high-stakes offensive</a> in coastal southern Ukraine and the country&rsquo;s eastern industrial heartland has Ukrainian forces fighting village-by-village and more civilians fleeing airstrikes and artillery shelling as war draws near their doorsteps.</p>
<p>Pelosi, a California Democrat who is second in line to succeed the president, is the most senior American lawmaker to travel to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Her Saturday visit came just days after Russia launched rockets at the capital during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres.</p>
<p>During a Sunday news conference in the Polish city of Rzeszow, Pelosi said she and other members of a U.S. congressional delegation met with Zelenskyy in Ukraine&#8217;s capital, Kyiv, for three hours and brought him &ldquo;a message of appreciation from the American people for his leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rep. Jason Crow, a U.S. Army veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, said he came to Ukraine with three areas of focus: &ldquo;Weapons, weapons and weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to win. What we have seen in the last two months is their ferocity, their intense pride, their ability to fight and their ability to win if they have the support to do so,&rdquo; the Colorado Democrat said.</p>
<p>Russian forces have embarked on a major military operation to seize significant parts of southern and eastern Ukraine following their failure to capture the capital, Kyiv. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, is a key target because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the leaders of the free world know what Russia has done to Mariupol. And Russia will not go unpunished for this,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. He warned that Russia was &ldquo;gathering additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Limited evacuations from the city took place on Saturday, but the details had been unclear given the number of parties involved in the negotiations and the volatile situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry said a total of 46 people were evacuated from areas near the Azovstal plant.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ukrainian regiment Deputy Commander Sviatoslav Palamar called for the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian fighters as well as civilians. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why they are not taken away and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,&rdquo; he said in a video posted on the regiment&#8217;s Telegram channel.</p>
<p>Undeterred by air raid sirens and warnings to shelter at home, people in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia visited cemeteries Sunday, when Ukrainians observe the Orthodox Christian day of the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If our dead could rise and see this, they would say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not possible, they&rsquo;re worse than the Germans,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hennadiy Bondarenko, 61, said while marking the day with his family at a picnic table among the graves. &ldquo;All our dead would join the fighting, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e2dcda041fa84a7192093bfe98dea55a"  target="_blank">including the Cossacks</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Also, both Ukraine and Moscow-backed rebels have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone.</p>
<p>But Western military analysts have suggested the offensive in the Donbas region, which includes Mariupol, was going much slower than planned. So far, Russian troops and the separatists appeared to have made only minor gains in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in the east.</p>
<p>Video and images from inside the Mariupol steel plant, shared with The Associated Press by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands are among the fighters refusing to surrender there, showed unidentified men with stained bandages; others had open wounds or amputated limbs.</p>
<p>A skeleton medical staff was treating at least 600 wounded people, said the women, who identified their husbands as members of the Azov Regiment of Ukraine&rsquo;s National Guard. Some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene, they said.</p>
<p>The AP could not independently verify the date and location of the video, which the women said was taken in the last week in the maze of corridors and bunkers beneath the plant.</p>
<p>Numerically, Russia&rsquo;s military manpower vastly exceeds Ukraine&rsquo;s. In the days before the war began, Western intelligence estimated Russia had positioned near the border as many as 190,000 troops; Ukraine&rsquo;s standing military totals about 200,000, spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>With plenty of firepower still in reserve, Russia&rsquo;s offensive still could intensify and overrun the Ukrainians. Overall the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel. Russia also has a much larger air force and navy.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance has flowed into Ukraine since the war began, but Russia&#8217;s vast armories mean Ukraine will continue to require huge amounts of support.</p>

<p>U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met Ukraine&rsquo;s president on Saturday in a previously unannounced visit to Kyiv, telling him that &ldquo;your fight is a fight for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pelosi, second in line to the U.S. presidency, became the highest-ranked American official to travel to the country since Russia&rsquo;s invasion. Her visit follows one last weekend by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our delegation traveled to Kyiv to send an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire world: America stands firmly with Ukraine,&rdquo; Pelosi said in a statement released by her office on Sunday.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky showed footage of Pelosi&rsquo;s visit on his Ukrainian-language Twitter account early Sunday. &ldquo;Thank you for helping to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state!&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>The video showed Zelenskiy shaking hands with Pelosi and other U.S. lawmakers on the streets of Kyiv, including Democrats Gregory Meeks of New York, Adam Schiff of California, Jason Crow of Colorado and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done,&rdquo; Pelosi told Zelenskiy in the video.</p>

<p>Saturday night&rsquo;s meeting with Zelenskiy lasted for three hours, Schiff said Sunday at a media briefing in Rzeszow, Poland, close to the border with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized the importance of &ldquo;good and timely&rdquo; U.S. intelligence cooperation with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s delegation will travel on to Warsaw, where they&rsquo;ll meet with President Andrzej Duda and senior officials, according to the earlier statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we return to the United States, we will do so further informed, deeply inspired and ready to do what is needed to help the Ukrainian people as they defend democracy for their nation and for the world,&rdquo; Pelosi said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is currently seeking an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-28/republicans-warn-against-combining-ukraine-aid-with-covid-bill"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">additional $33 billion</a> in aid to Ukraine and new authority from Congress to seize and sell property linked to wealthy allies of President Vladimir Putin. Pelosi on Friday termed the aid package &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and vowed to pass it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>PARIS &mdash; Citizens and trade unions in cities around Europe were taking to the streets on Sunday for May Day marches, and to put out protest messages to their governments, notably in France where the holiday to honor workers was being used as a rallying cry against newly reelected President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>May Day is a time of high emotion for participants and their causes, with police on the ready. Turkish police moved in quickly in Istanbul and encircled protesters near the barred-off Taksim Square &mdash; where 34 people were killed In 1977 during a May Day event when shots were fired into the crowd from a nearby building.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>On Sunday, police detained 164 people for demonstrating without permits and resisting police at the square, the Istanbul governor&#8217;s office said. At a site on the Asian side of Istanbul, a May Day gathering drew thousands, singing, chanting and waving banners, a demonstration organized by the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey.</p>
<p>In Italy, after a two-year pandemic lull, an outdoor mega-concert was set for Rome with rallies and protests in cities across the country. Besides work, peace was an underlying theme with calls for an end to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s three main labor unions were focusing their main rally in the hilltop town of Assisi, a frequent destination for peace protests. This year&rsquo;s slogan is &ldquo;Working for peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a May Day of social and civil commitment for peace and labor,&rdquo; said the head of Italy&rsquo;s CISL union, Daniela Fumarola.</p>
<p>Other protests were planned far and wide in Europe, including in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where students and others planned to rally in support of Ukraine as Communists, anarchists and anti-European Union groups held their own gatherings.</p>
<p>In France, the May Day rallies &mdash; a week after the presidential election &mdash; are aimed at showing Macron the opposition he could face in his second five-year term and to power up against his centrists before June legislative elections. Opposition parties, notably the far left and far right, are looking to break his government&rsquo;s majority.</p>
<p>Protests were planned across France with a focus on Paris where the Communist-backed CGT union was leading the main march through eastern Paris, joined by a handful of other unions. All are pressing Macron for policies that put the people first and condemning his plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65.</p>
<p>In a first, far-right leader Marine Le Pen was absent from her party&rsquo;s traditional wreath-laying at the foot of a statue of Joan of Arc, replaced by the interim president of her National Rally party. Le Pen was defeated by Macron in last Sunday&#8217;s runoff of the presidential election, and plans to campaign to keep her seat as a lawmaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell the French that the voting isn&rsquo;t over. There is a third round, the legislative elections,&rdquo; said Jordan Bardella, &ldquo;and it would be unbelievable to leave full power to Emmanuel Macron.&rdquo;</p>
