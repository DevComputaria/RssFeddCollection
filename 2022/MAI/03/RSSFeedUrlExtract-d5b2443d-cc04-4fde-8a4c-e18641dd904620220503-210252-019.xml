      <title>Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software Web Services Interface Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-mgmt-privesc-BMFMUvye?vs_f=Cisco%20Security%20Advisory&amp;vs_cat=Security%20Intelligence&amp;vs_type=RSS&amp;vs_p=Cisco%20Adaptive%20Security%20Appliance%20Software%20and%20Firepower%20Threat%20Defense%20Software%20Web%20Services%20Interface%20Privilege%20Escalation%20Vulnerability&amp;vs_k=1</link>
      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the web services interface for remote access VPN features of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, but unprivileged, remote attacker to elevate privileges to level 15.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication and authorization scopes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS messages to the web services interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privilege level 15 access to the web management interface of the device. This includes privilege level 15 access to the device using management tools like the Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or the Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Security Manager (CSM).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; With Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;FTD Software, the impact is lower than the CVSS score suggests because the affected web management interface allows for read access only.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This advisory is available at the following link:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-mgmt-privesc-BMFMUvye&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-mgmt-privesc-BMFMUvye&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software AnyConnect SSL VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vpndtls-dos-TunzLEV?vs_f=Cisco%20Security%20Advisory&amp;vs_cat=Security%20Intelligence&amp;vs_type=RSS&amp;vs_p=Cisco%20Adaptive%20Security%20Appliance%20and%20Cisco%20Firepower%20Threat%20Defense%20Software%20AnyConnect%20SSL%20VPN%20Denial%20of%20Service%20Vulnerability&amp;vs_k=1</link>
      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the implementation of the Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocol in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to suboptimal processing that occurs when establishing a DTLS tunnel as part of an AnyConnect SSL VPN connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted DTLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected VPN headend device. This could cause existing DTLS tunnels to stop passing traffic and prevent new DTLS tunnels from establishing, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: When the attack traffic stops, the device recovers gracefully.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTPS request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in an IPsec VPN library of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read or modify data within an IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to an improper implementation of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) ciphers. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a sufficient number of encrypted messages across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel and then using cryptanalytic techniques to break the encryption. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt, read, modify, and re-encrypt data that is transmitted across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes.&amp;amp;nbsp;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;root&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;root&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;root&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;root&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; user.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the IPSec decryption routine of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to buffer exhaustion that occurs while traffic on a configured IPsec tunnel is being processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to an affected device that has a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1800 bytes or greater. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may need access to the trusted network where the affected device is in order to send specific packets to be processed by the device. All network devices between the attacker and the affected device must support an MTU of 1800 bytes or greater. This access requirement could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the Application Visibility and Control (AVC-FNF) feature of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;IOS XE Software for Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient packet verification for traffic inspected by the AVC feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets from the wired network to a wireless client, resulting in the crafted packets being processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>
			
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol processing of Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This vulnerability is due to inadequate input validation of incoming CAPWAP packets encapsulating multicast DNS (mDNS) queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a wireless network and sending a crafted mDNS query, which would flow through and be processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cisco&amp;amp;nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
