      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 Promotions:</strong> The wait of 15 long years was over as the sequel of the 2007 superhit film Bhool Bhulaiyaa is all set to a return this month. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 is scheduled to hit the theaters on 20 May 2022. The official trailer of the movie was launched on 26th April and got millions of views overnight and was on trending on all social media sites and the trailer on YouTube has over 50 million views in 5 days.</p>
<h2>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 Promotions: Kartik Aryan traveling North India</h2>
<p>Fans and hyped up and so is the lead actor of the movie Kartik Aryan as he has thrown himself completely into the promotions of the film. Right after the trailer release, Kartik started the promotions by regularly posting on social media, appearing in popular reality TV shows and just recently the Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 team started a four-city tour featuring Chandigarh, Lucknow, Delhi, and Gurgaon. The first visit was in Chandigarh where the Title track of Bhool Bhulaiya 2 got launched and Kartik received a huge amount of love from his Chandigarh fans. Kartik went live on Instagram and also shared some video from the show and captioned it with his love for Chandigarh.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-124185 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 Promotions" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=750%2C422&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bhool-Bhulaiyaa-2-Promotions.jpg?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, the plan of the promotion team is to launch Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 tracks in each city and the next will be Lucknow, followed by Delhi, and lastly Gurgaon. There is some extra pressure related to the film as there are lots of expectations from the fans simply because of how good the original film was, also it will be interesting to see if Kartik would be able to match Akshay&#8217;s performance or not.</p>
<p>The other fear is the failure of Bollywood films in recent months and the success of south Indian films like Pushpa, RRR, and KGF 2 that are still ruling at the box office and have created mayhem. Hence the makers of Bhool Bhulaiyaa are making sure that no stone is left unturned. Bhool Bhulaiyaa can be the movie to bring Bollywood on track and it will be interesting to see whether fans will love it or not, but for that, we will have to wait till May 20.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling Aishwarya Rai Bachchan beautiful would be an understatement. Aishwarya Rai truly has some power of a siren who knows how to cast a spell on people with her charm.</p>
<p>Only a few of us know that Hollywood actress Eva Longoria and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan share a close bond. The reason for their friendship could be being the brand ambassadors of the same beauty brand L&#8217;Oreal Paris.<br />
Let&#8217;s take you back to 2019, when Bollywood&#8217;s heartthrob Aishwarya visited Paris, to mark her debut in Paris Fashion Week.<br />
There Aishwarya re-united her long-time and close mate, Eva Longoria. She also posted a video on her official Instagram handle where both the actresses could share a moment.</p>

<p>Palak Tiwari was as of late seen strolling on the incline and doing it like a sovereign. the young lady looked at each piece dazzling and one can&#8217;t take their eyes off her. Palak is gradually turning into a sensation and how she is no less well known than some other star kid. She appreciates equivalent fame like some other star youngster and all gratitude to her mom Shweta Tiwari&#8217;s persistent effort. Today the young lady is laying and how. While Palak strolled the slope got a great deal of analysis on the equivalent. Many said that his way is the most obviously awful slope walk ever they have seen</p>
<h3><strong>What did one client say to her?</strong></h3>

<p>One client composed, &#8221; Worst walk at any point seen&#8221;. Another client remarked, &#8221; Itna ganda incline walk kya yaar superstar hai acting Kro jesy dance gazab giya that apne collection mai chalti kudi&#8230;. Something to that effect&#8221;. While another client said, &#8221; Saara state of mind kharab Kar Diya&#8221;. Notwithstanding, barely any adulated her and said that today her mother Shweta Tiwari&#8217;s persistent effort is getting compensated off. Palak will before long make her Bollywood debut as well, this moment she is zeroing in on collection tunes.</p>

Asserting that there are three pandits in the new movie, chief Anees Bazmee said, &#8220;Rajpal was awesome in the principal film, alongside the remainder of the cast including Paresh Rawal ji. Here, when we were composing the continuation, there were three pandit characters. That offered me the chance to get Rajpal on board once more.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.563em;">Kartik Aaryan&#8217;s incredible dance on Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2</span></strong></p>

<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s a reproduced form of the track which was initially utilized in the 2007 delivery Bhool Bhulaiyaa. While some netizens have enjoyed the track, some vibe that it has been demolished. Be that as it may, everybody is applauding Kartik&#8217;s incredible dance motion pictures in the melody.</p>
<h3><strong>Title Track by Pritam</strong></h3>
<p>A netizen remarked, &#8220;Your steps and looks were so staggering.&#8221; Another fan stated, &#8220;Completely shock it K.&#8221; One more fan remarked, &#8220;Your dance moves are on FIREEEEEE.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first track of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 was made by Pritam and the tune has been reproduced by Tanishk Bagchi. All things considered, Kartik&#8217;s astounding dance moves are arranged by Bosco and Caeser. Indeed, for the advancement of the tune, the creators have arranged a multi-city visit with Kartik.</p>
<h3><strong>Compare trailer with Bhool Bhulaiyaa 1</strong></h3>
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (Trailer) Kartik A, Kiara A, Tabu | Anees B, Bhushan K, Murad K, Anjum K, Pritam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2KRKxAb2ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1rOfVst-EQ">trailer</a> send-off of the film, while looking at being contrasted with Akshay Kumar, Kartik had said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t analyze in light of the fact that it&#8217;s too huge a shoe to fill. I had cherished him (Akshay Kumar) in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 1, and have grown up watching him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better not to look at them, I love him as an entertainer. We have made an honest effort to do it as we would prefer. In any case, this is another film, part of new components. I trust individuals will cherish it in their own dynamic. Correlations will occur, however, I trust Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 will be recognized as another film.&#8221;</p>
