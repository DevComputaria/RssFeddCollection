      <description><![CDATA[From Bored Ape Yacht Club theft to fake reviews and facial recognition woes – its episode 248 of the Transatlantic Cable]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 248 of the Transatlantic Cable. In this week&#8217;s episode myself and Ahmed look at some of the more unique or interesting stories to come out of the tech / info-sec world.</p>
<p>To kick things off, we look at a breaking story about how BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club, to you and me) is reeling after a hack on their Instagram account led to the theft of quite a few NFTs.</p>
<p>From there, we look at how an actor&#8217;s guild is getting increasingly concerned about AI and deep-fakes, calling for reform. Following that, we look at a concerning story around fake reviews and how the US government is looking at legislation to try to tackle rampant fakery.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, we look at news from Google showing that 2021 was a &#8216;banner-year&#8217; for zero-day exploits and their usage.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[How the mute button actually works in audio conferencing software and is it safe to use it?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the two years of the pandemic, millions of people learned to use numerous remote collaboration tools. If previously users thought little about security, after the massive uptake of such services, they started paying far more attention to it. Interest in the security of conferencing software has yet to abate, in which regard researchers at three U.S. universities published a <a href="https://wiscprivacy.com/papers/vca_mute.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> on whether the microphone mute button in popular tools actually does what it says on the tin. The results were varied, yet undoubtedly suggest that it&#8217;s time to reconsider attitudes to privacy during work calls.</p>
<h2>Where did the idea come from?</h2>
<p>Actually, the idea was quite obvious. If you&#8217;ve ever used Microsoft Teams, you&#8217;ll surely be familiar with the following situation: you connect to a call in Mute mode, forget to turn it off and start talking, whereupon the program <em>reminds you</em> that the microphone is muted. Clearly, such an (admittedly handy) feature cannot work if the mute button disconnects the microphone altogether. How, then, is this feature actually implemented? And is sound from the microphone sent to the solution vendor&#8217;s server even in Mute mode?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions posed by the authors of the study. But how to check? For this, the researchers analyzed the intricacies of microphone interaction for ten services, in each case examining the scenario for browser-based calls.</p>
<h2>Research results</h2>
<p>From a privacy point of view, the best solution for conference calls would appear to be a web client. All web-based conferencing services were tested in a browser based on the Chromium open-source engine (the basis of many browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge). In this mode, all services must comply with the rules for microphone interaction, as set by the developers of the browser engine. That is, when the microphone mute button is activated in the web interface, the service should pick up no sound at all. Native desktop applications have more rights.</p>
<div id="attachment_44194" style="width: 2080px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/28181401/muted2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44194" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/28181401/muted2.png" alt="General scheme of interaction between native conferencing application and operating system (in this case Windows 10)." width="2070" height="431" class="size-full wp-image-24373" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44194" class="wp-caption-text">General scheme of interaction between native conferencing application and operating system (in this case Windows 10). <a href="https://wiscprivacy.com/papers/vca_mute.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a></p></div>
<p>The researchers analyzed how and when the application interacts with the microphone by comparing audio data captured from the microphone with the stream of information sent to the server. And they found that different programs have different behavior. Here&#8217;s what they learned about the most popular services.</p>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p>The Zoom client provides an example of &#8220;decent&#8221; behavior. In Mute mode, it does not capture the audio stream; that is, it does not eavesdrop on what&#8217;s going on around you. That said, the client regularly requests information that allows it to determine the noise level near the microphone. As soon as the silence ends (you start talking or just make a noise), the client reminds you, as ever, to turn off Mute mode.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned native client for Microsoft Teams, things are slightly more complicated: the program doesn&#8217;t use the standard system interface for microphone interaction, and instead communicates directly with Windows. As such, the researchers were unable to investigate in detail how the Teams client handles muting during a call.</p>
<h3>Cisco Webex</h3>
<p>The Cisco Webex client displayed the most unusual behavior. Unique among all the solutions tested, it constantly processed the sound from the microphone during the call, regardless of the state of the Mute button inside the application. However, investigating the client in more detail, the researchers found that Webex does <em>not</em> snoop on you: in Mute mode, sound is not transmitted to the remote server. But it does send metadata; specifically — the volume level of the signal.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this doesn&#8217;t seem like a big deal. However, solely on the basis of this metadata, without access to the actual audio stream, the researchers were still able to determine a number of basic parameters of what was happening at the user&#8217;s end. For example, it was possible to determine with a reasonable degree of reliability that the user had turned off the microphone and camera, and turned on his vacuum cleaner. Or cooking. Or that a dog was barking. It was possible to know if others were present in the room (for example, that the call was coming from a public place). This involved the use of an algorithm similar in some ways to that of Shazam and other music discovery apps. For each &#8220;noise sample&#8221;, a set of patterns is created and compared to the data captured from the Cisco Webex client.</p>
<h2>Privacy levels</h2>
<p>The study offers some practical advice and confirms one obvious fact: you don&#8217;t have full control over what data is collected on you or how. A positive takeaway from the report is that it found no crime in the operation of popular conferencing tools. Many applications tread very carefully when it comes to microphone use.</p>
<p>If, despite these positive results, you&#8217;re still uneasy about having a native application on your computer with constant access to the microphone, a simple solution, if possible, is to connect through a web client. Sure, the functionality will be limited, but privacy will increase: the Mute button there really does disconnect the microphone from the service.</p>
<p>Another option is a hardware microphone Mute button, if there is one on your computer. Or an external headset — the Mute button on top-of-the-range models often isolates the microphone from the computer physically, not by software means.</p>
<p>The real danger is not the conferencing tools themselves, but malware that can snoop on victims and send audio recordings of important conversations to its creators. In this case, you need not only a security solution that deals with unwanted programs, but also a means of controlling who accesses the microphone and when — in case a legitimate program decides to do so without asking. Kaspersky&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/small-business-security/small-office-security?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____ksos___" target="_blank">solutions</a> for both home and business feature a separate function that informs you when software tries to access the microphone or webcam.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Meet Gabriel Mitacchione, Sales Assistant at Kaspersky Iberia.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabriel loves to play football (soccer!) and electric guitar, and he&#8217;s a fan of all things blockchain technology and the NFT ecosystem. But life hasn&#8217;t been easy for him: he had to leave his parents in Venezuela and immigrate to Spain, where he started working at Kaspersky in the middle of the covid lockdown. In this interview, Gabriel tells us about his journey to cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>– Growing up in Venezuela, how was it? We often see news about the crisis in your home country…</strong></p>
<p>– My childhood was good; I loved sports, and played football a lot with my friends. Both of my parents are petroleum engineers. They worked for the oil industry until the political situation started affecting us — both of them lost their jobs and we had it hard for a while. I had to keep getting excellent grades in school to get scholarship; it was quite tough.</p>
<p>After high school I decided to become an engineer like my parents, but I found that Materials Engineering was more interesting for me. Studying at a university isn&#8217;t easy during a bad economic situation. However, in 2018 I received my degree in Materials Engineering from Universidad Simón Bolívar, one of the most prestigious universities in the country.</p>
<p><strong>– Near Moscow State University, where I often walk with my kids, there&#8217;s a memorial monument to Simón Bolívar. What should I tell my kids about him?</strong></p>
<p>– Simón Bolívar is one of the main heroes in Latin America history. From 1500 to 1830, most countries in Latin America were part of the Spanish empire. Bolivar was the guy who liberated many countries, including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and of course Venezuela — after all he was Venezuelan!</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/26134005/interview-gabriel-mitacchione-photo-1.jpg"><img src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/26134005/interview-gabriel-mitacchione-photo-1.jpg" alt="Meet Gabriel Mitacchione, Sales Assistant at Kaspersky Iberia" width="2555" height="1680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24363" /></a></p>
<p><strong>– Why did you move to Spain?</strong></p>
<p>– Well, in crisis times many people go to other countries, looking for a better life. In fact, my father is a son of Italian immigrants who moved to Venezuela after World War II. So I&#8217;m part European, and I decided to start afresh in Europe. I chose Spain because of the language, and besides, some of my friends also migrated to Spain.</p>
<p><strong>– How different is your new country? What&#8217;s better, and what&#8217;s strange?</strong></p>
<p>– Spain is beautiful. Here in Madrid I&#8217;m living my life, not just surviving. And Spanish girls are very nice, especially in the south! My girlfriend is from down there (Andalusia), we&#8217;ve been together for three years now and we&#8217;re going to get married!</p>
<p>As to strange feelings, yes, I don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s my culture. Spanish and Venezuelan people both speak Spanish, but there&#8217;s still a cultural barrier, and some words have different meanings. But it&#8217;s alright.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to have the feeling of developing a new life, but feeling alone throughout the process can be tricky. It&#8217;s hard to lose someone close — not being able to be with them in their last moments. I sadly lost my grandma when I was already living here. I didn&#8217;t say goodbye to her. And I miss being with my parents. I miss them every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/26134017/interview-gabriel-mitacchione-photo-2.jpg"><img src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/26134017/interview-gabriel-mitacchione-photo-2.jpg" alt="Meet Gabriel Mitacchione, Sales Assistant at Kaspersky Iberia" width="2555" height="1680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24365" /></a></p>
<p><strong>– You said you had a degree in Materials Engineering. But it&#8217;s quite far from cybersecurity. What was your reason to go to Kaspersky?</strong></p>
<p>– I&#8217;ve known about Kaspersky since I bought my first laptop back in 2014. It came in a bundle with a one-year subscription for Kaspersky Internet Security, and for exactly one year my laptop worked perfectly. Then the license expired. I changed antivirus: mistake! Sure enough my laptop got messed up. I should have known better back then!</p>
<p>While at university, I tried to study computer engineering first, for a few semesters, but I found it wasn&#8217;t for me. I was more interested in physics and chemistry at that time.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve been always passionate about IT. So when I finished my first internship at a plastic parts factory, I started working for a cryptocurrency company. That&#8217;s when I realized that I liked the world of business and corporate sales. So I came to Spain to study for an MBA and to combine both of my passions — business and tech. I was lucky to be selected for the internship in Kaspersky while finishing my MBA degree.</p>
<p><strong>– You started working at Kaspersky during lockdown in Spain. How did the restrictions influence your work?</strong></p>
<p>– Yes, at the beginning it was a bit awkward when you&#8217;re not meeting every day with your colleagues in the office. It was comfortable in some ways, but also there was the fear that it would be difficult to collaborate and learn.</p>
<p>I started as Sales Intern for the SMB channel in Iberia. Basically, I had to be the main sales support for all the channel and territory managers, to manage a bunch of stuff related to our CRM, to be in touch with partners, customers and distributors, to do onboarding of new partners, and to solve problems that they might have with the partner portal.</p>
<p>Sure, covid restrictions made my work more difficult, but those restrictions also helped me develop a sense of responsibility, as well as communication skills and the ability to multitask. I learned a lot from my colleagues remotely. And when I finally met my coworkers during our event for partners in Barcelona, it was a bit funny to see them for the first time in person after working together almost a year!</p>

<p><strong>– What are the most common questions that people ask about Kaspersky products when you present these products to them? Did their attitudes change after the Ukrainian conflict started?</strong></p>
<p>– There&#8217;s a little bit of everything. There are lots of people who are interested in security technologies: they mostly have questions about product features. Many of them recognize Kaspersky as a market leader — this makes my work easier.</p>
<p>Their main concerns are mostly the same: what if the service stops working or they suffer from some attack, and they need access to support to solve their problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now some people are just scared of the bad reputation that comes along due to the Ukrainian conflict. Some of them say they love our product but their bosses don&#8217;t want to be involved with any Russian company. It&#8217;s sad to hear because this kind of Russophobia makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>– Did you ever think your life would be happier if you chose a different company to work for — not a Russian one — for your career?</strong></p>
<p>– Not once! I can say that my Russian colleagues are some of the nicest people I&#8217;ve worked with. Since starting work here I&#8217;ve felt understood. From the very beginning, they were always helping me learn quick so I could become more productive. It&#8217;s something about the organizational culture. There&#8217;s no toxic competition — only collaboration and team work. I&#8217;ve been welcomed not just to a company but to a warm family. Without a doubt it&#8217;s the best company I&#8217;ve worked for in my experience so far. And I hope I can stay here and develop my career for many years.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[What a “browser-in-the-browser” attack is, and how to prevent a phishing site that uses it from stealing your password.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In their relentless pursuit of folks&#8217; credentials, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/metamask-wallets-scam/43962/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret keys</a> and other valuable information, cybercriminals are continually inventing new ways to deceive users. It&#8217;s worth noting that normally, no matter how sophisticated these schemes become, they&#8217;re all aimed at users who drop their guard. If you just pay close attention to a few details — first and foremost, the address of the website where you&#8217;re being asked to enter your credentials — you won&#8217;t be a phishing victim.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s almost always the case. But today we want to tell you about an attack that works differently, with the URL looking correct and safe to the victim. Let&#8217;s walk through it.</p>
<h2>Why are there errors in the addresses of phishing sites?</h2>
<p>Every domain address that you see in the address bar is unique and always assigned to its owner. If someone wants to create a website, they first need to contact a special organization that registers domain names. They&#8217;ll check an international database to make sure the address isn&#8217;t already taken. If it&#8217;s available, it gets assigned to the applicant.</p>
<p>This means that it&#8217;s impossible to register a fake website with the same address as a real website. However, it is quite possible to create a domain that&#8217;s very similar to someone else&#8217;s by choosing a similar domain zone: for example, Colombia (.co) instead of Canada (.ca). But if you look closely at the address, that&#8217;s easy to spot.</p>
<p>This is why instead of registering domains, sophisticated minds came up with the idea to <strong>simulate</strong> a browser window with a trusted site&#8217;s address appearing on a page.</p>
<h2>What is a browser-in-the-browser attack?</h2>
<p>This type of attack, which has come to be known as a &#8220;browser-in-the-browser&#8221; attack was described by an infosec researcher and <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/penetration-tester-pentester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pentester</a> going by the <a href="https://mrd0x.com/browser-in-the-browser-phishing-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">handle mr.d0x</a>. He noticed that modern means of creating websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools) have become so advanced they can display practically anything on the page: from fields of any color or shape, to animation that imitates the moving components of the interface. This means that a phisher can also use them to simulate a full-fledged page from a different service inside their own website.</p>
<p>For the experiment, mr.d0x looked at pop-up login windows. You&#8217;ve probably seen them: they appear when you choose an option like &#8220;Sign in with Google&#8221; or &#8220;Continue with Apple&#8221; instead of creating an account on a website. This option is convenient because you don&#8217;t need to come up with and remember a new password or wait for confirmation links or codes. Also, this sign-up method is rather safe. When you push the <em>Sign in with</em> button, it opens the page of the relevant service on which you enter your credentials, and the website you&#8217;re logging in to with this option never receives the password, not even temporarily.</p>
<div id="attachment_44170" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/25121714/browser-in-the-browser-attack-screen-EN.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44170" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2022/04/25121714/browser-in-the-browser-attack-screen-EN.jpg" alt="This is what a real login window for a third-party service looks like" width="1350" height="1100" class="size-full wp-image-24347" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44170" class="wp-caption-text">This is what a real login window for a third-party service looks like</p></div>
<p>Enter a browser-in-the-browser attack. It works like this: The cybercriminals register a website using the classic phishing technique of making a clone of a legitimate website. Alternatively, they could choose an attractive address and content that may lure victims — such as shopping deals, job opportunities, or news a user might want to comment on. The criminals set things up so that visitors need to sign in if they want to buy something, comment, or access other features that interest them. Then the malefactors add buttons that supposedly permit logging in through the legitimate services they want to harvest passwords from.</p>
<p>If victims click on such a button, they&#8217;ll see a login window they&#8217;re familiar with, such as a Microsoft, Google, or Apple prompt, with the correct address, logo, and input fields — in short, all the components of the interface they&#8217;re used to seeing. The window can even display correct addresses when users hover the mouse over the &#8220;Log in&#8221; button and &#8220;Forgot password&#8221; link.</p>
<p>The catch is that this isn&#8217;t actually a separate window — this marvel of deception is scripted to appear right on the page that is trying to trick the user. If you enter your credentials in this window, they won&#8217;t go to Microsoft, Google, or Apple, but rather straight to the cybercriminal&#8217;s server. Here you can see <a href="https://mrd0x.com/browser-in-the-browser-phishing-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">what this may look like</a>.</p>
<h2>How can you tell if the login window is fake?</h2>
<p>Although there&#8217;s nothing about the bogus login window that looks obviously fake, there are ways to identify it as such.</p>
<p>Real login windows are browser windows, and they act that way. You can maximize and minimize them and move them anywhere on the screen. Fake pop-ups are bound to the page where they&#8217;re located. They can also move freely and cover buttons and images, but only inside their boundaries — that is, <strong>within</strong> the browser window. They cannot go outside it. That difference should help you spot them.</p>
<p>To check whether the login form on your screen is fake, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize the browser window the form popped up from. If the login form that is supposed to be in a separate window vanishes too, then it&#8217;s fake. A real window should stay on the screen.</li>
<li>Attempt to move the login window beyond the parent window border. A real window will easily cross over; a fake one will get stuck.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the window with the login form behaves oddly — it minimizes with the other window, stops under the address bar, or disappears under it — it is fake, and you should not enter your credentials.</p>
<h2>Is there an easier way to protect myself?</h2>
<p>The attack is not as dangerous as it might seem at first glance. Although it&#8217;s quite hard for humans to spot a browser-in-the-browser attack, your computer can help you. No matter what is scripted on a dangerous site, the real address remains the same, and that&#8217;s what matters to a security solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to use a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/password-manager?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kpm___" target="_blank">password manager</a> for all your accounts. It verifies the page&#8217;s real address, and it will never enter your credentials into the fields of an unknown site, no matter how legitimate it may look.</li>
<li>Install a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/advert/security-cloud?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____ksc___" target="_blank">robust security solution</a> with an anti-phishing module. This solution also verifies the URL for you and will warn you immediately if a page is dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, remember to use two-factor authentication. Enable it wherever you have the option to do so, including on all social networks. Then, even if attackers steal your credentials, they won&#8217;t be able to access your account without a one-time code, which will be sent to you, not them.</p>
<p>If you want more powerful protection for your extra valuable accounts, we recommend that you use U2F hardware tokens (the best known example being <a href="https://yubikey.me/yubikey-for-individuals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">YubiKey</a>). This system checks not only a website&#8217;s address but also if it knows the encryption key. As a result, it is impossible to make it through such an authentication system even if the original site and its twin look identical.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Kaspersky talks about new steps toward information transparency.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, we launched our <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Transparency Initiative</a> (GTI). Under this project, we moved part of our data infrastructure to Switzerland and opened Transparency Centers where our partners and customers can review the source code of our products. We also had our data services and engineering practices evaluated by third-party independent accredited organizations. In addition, we now regularly disclose information regarding requests from government agencies for data and technical expertise which Kaspersky receives in the context of cybercrime investigations. Today, we will talk about new steps in this initiative.</p>
<h2>What has been done as part of the Global Transparency Initiative</h2>
<p>In the five years since we launched the program, we have opened four Transparency Centers where our customers and partners can review our products&#8217; source code, software updates to make sure there are no hidden features or undocumented capabilities in our solutions. In addition, we also provide our engineering and data management practices for external examination. Kaspersky Transparency Centers operate in Europe, Latin America and Asia. For those unable to visit our Centers in person we offer remote visits.</p>
<p>As a technology and cybersecurity company, we process data which our products use to increase the effectiveness of the cyber-protection provided to users. This data includes information about cyberthreats — for example suspicious and malicious files which our products send, if users agree, for automated cloud-based malware analysis. The data helps us identify new and unknown threats, continually improve our solutions, and offer users better ways to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Since November 2018, such cyberthreat-related data of our users in Europe has been stored and processed in our data centers in Switzerland. A short while later, we also relocated to Switzerland processing and storage of such data for users in North America, Latin America, the Middle East, and a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>We also received ISO 27001 compliance certification from the TÜV AUSTRIA independent certification body. It confirmed that our company has an effective information security management system in place. Our users can be confident that the data processed by Kaspersky is under the highest level of protection.</p>
<p>Besides, we launched <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/capacity-building" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyber Capacity Building Program</a> training for companies, government organizations, and academia to help them develop the skills needed to protect their IT systems. More recently, we extended opportunities and launched a <a href="https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/courses/cyber-capacity-building-program?icid=gl_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital version of training</a>, which can now be accessed by both organizations and individual users.</p>
<h2>New steps to transparency</h2>
<p>Kaspersky has done a lot of work on the road to greater transparency, and does not plan to stop there. We have recently taken new steps as part of the Global Transparency Initiative (GTI).</p>
<h3>Data center expansion in Zurich</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, we have significantly increased the capacity of our data centers in Zurich, where we now process malicious and suspicious files from users in Latin America and the Middle East. We have also relocated the processing and storage of such cyberthreat-related data for North American countries that weren&#8217;t previously included: Mexico, Panama, Jamaica, and other island nations.</p>
<p>Switzerland was chosen for a reason: the country has one of the stringent data protection regulations. Our two data centers in Zurich also operate with world-class equipment that meets the highest industry standards.</p>
<h3>ISO 27001 recertification</h3>
<p>Kaspersky data systems were recertified by TÜV AUSTRIA in accordance with the <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/iso-27001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements of ISO 27001</a>. And it&#8217;s not just certification renewal; this time the scope of the audit was significantly expanded. The certification now covers both data systems for processing cyberthreat-related data (Kaspersky Distributed File System, KLDFS) and statistics (KSNBuffer database).</p>
<p>TÜV AUSTRIA is an independent certification body. We are proud that Kaspersky&#8217;s approach to data security has once again been recognized.</p>
<h3>Working with requests from government and law enforcement agencies</h3>
<p>Alright, you say, user data is secure, but what about information requests from law enforcement agencies? In fact, Kaspersky regularly shares about its approach toward working with such requests and since last year, the company has been issuing reports on requests from law enforcement and government agencies, In addition, we&#8217;ve just recently published a <a href="https://media.kaspersky.com/en/reports/law-enforcement-and-government-requests-report-h2-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report for the second half of 2021</a>. Here are some key figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our experts received 109 requests from government and law enforcement agencies from 12 countries.</li>
<li>92 requests referred to technical expertise, and 17 contained a request for access to user data.</li>
<li>All 17 requests to hand over user data were rejected. Some of them did not meet legal requirements, while others asked for data that the company simply did not have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users too ask us where and how their personal data is stored. Some people request to download or delete it. In 2021, we handled 2,252 requests of this kind.</p>
<h3>New level of education program</h3>
<p>Kaspersky is always ready to share its experience with the global community. We have expanded our Cyber Capacity Building Program by launching a similar <a href="https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/courses/cyber-capacity-building-program?icid=gl_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online course</a>. Now even more partners and customers can take part in the program. The training will help organizations and individuals assess the security of the software they use and reduce the risk and potential consequences of cyberattacks.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next</h2>
<p>The trust of users, customers, and partners, is our top priority. We continue to refine our security practices and develop the Global Transparency Initiative, and hope that it will one day become the international standard for cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>As for the quality of protection that our security solutions provide, we have good news here as well. We&#8217;ve recently summarized the results of dozens of tests and reviews by leading independent laboratories that included our products in 2021. You can check out the results <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/top3-awards-2021/44050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[From criminal site shutdowns to Lazarus attacks and DeFi scams – it’s episode 247 of the Transatlantic Cable]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to episode 247 of the Transatlantic Cable, where we talk about all the recent info-sec related news you might have missed this week.</p>
<p>To kick off, the team look at a story around NFTs – in recent weeks, the overall trading volume of non-fungible tokens has dropped dramatically, but that didn&#8217;t faze the owner of Jack Dorsey&#8217;s first tweet – who was asking for $48M, however initial trading suggested it would only reach $6,800 – not great.  From there, Dave and Ahmed move on to a more disturbing story around a hack of the DeFi platform, Beanstalk – and how it happened is more mind-boggling than you could ever think.</p>
<p>Moving onwards, the team look at a recent story that suggests that North Korea is behind the hacking of a gaming platform and RaidForums, the once popular criminal forum, was shuttered in a joint effort by the FBI and Europol.</p>
<p>To close out the episode, they look at some hopeful news as the experts over at Kaspersky have managed to create a decryptor key for the Yanluowang ransomware.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Lazarus is on the hunt for cryptocurrency with the aid of a new backdoor distributed inside a DeFi wallet installer.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In mid-December last year, a suspicious file was uploaded to VirusTotal — the online service that scans files for malware. At first glance, it looked like a cryptocurrency wallet installer. But our experts <a href="https://securelist.com/lazarus-trojanized-defi-app/106195/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analyzed it</a> and found that, besides the wallet, it delivers malware to a user&#8217;s device. And it seems that the program isn&#8217;t the work of small-time crooks — but the infamous cybercriminals behind <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/lazarus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lazarus</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Lazarus?</h2>
<p>Lazarus is an <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/apt-advanced-persistent-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APT group</a>. Such groups are cybercriminal organizations that are typically well-funded, develop complex malware, and specialize in <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/targeted-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted attacks</a> — for example for industrial or political espionage. Stealing money, if it interests them at all, is not usually their primary goal.</p>
<p>Lazarus, however, is an APT group that actively goes after other people&#8217;s money. In 2016, for example, the group <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/lazarus-modus-operandi-and-countermeasures/6716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made off with a tidy sum</a> from the Central Bank of Bangladesh; in 2018 it <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/lazarus-crypto-exchange-attack/23610/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infected a cryptocurrency exchange</a> with malware; and in 2020 it tried its hand at <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/lazarus-vhd-ransomware/36559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ransomware</a>.</p>
<h2>DeFi wallet with backdoor</h2>
<p>The file that caught our researchers&#8217; collective eye contained an infected installer for a legitimate decentralized crypto wallet. DeFi (decentralized finance) is a financial model in which there are no intermediaries like banks, and all transactions are made directly between users. In recent years, DeFi technology has been gaining popularity. According to Forbes, for instance, from May 2020 to May 2021 the value of assets placed in DeFi systems <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/05/20/after-growing-88x-in-a-year-where-does-defi-go-from-here/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increased by 88 times</a>. Not surprisingly then, DeFi is attracting cybercriminal interest.</p>
<p>How exactly cybercriminals persuade victims to download and run the infected file is not entirely clear. However, our experts suppose that attackers send users <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/spear-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted e-mails</a> or messages in social media. Unlike mass mailings, such messages are tailored to a specific recipient and can look very plausible.</p>
<p>In any case, when the user runs the installer, it creates two executables: one — a malicious program, the other — a clean crypto wallet installer. The malware masks itself as the Google Chrome browser and tries to hide the existence of the infected installer by copying a clean installer in its place, which it runs immediately so that the user doesn&#8217;t suspect anything. Once the wallet is successfully installed, the malware continues to run in the background.</p>
<h2>How dangerous is it?</h2>
<p>The malware that gets slipped onto the computer with the DeFi wallet is a <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backdoor</a>. Depending on the operator&#8217;s intentions, the backdoor can either harvest information or provide remote control over the device. Specifically, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start and terminate processes;</li>
<li>Execute commands on the device;</li>
<li>Download files to the device, delete them, and send files from the device to the C&#038;C server.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, in case of a successful attack, the malware can disable the antivirus and steal whatever it likes — from valuable documents to accounts and money. It can also download other malicious programs to the computer as the cybercriminals see fit. As ever, more details are available in the <a href="https://securelist.com/lazarus-trojanized-defi-app/106195/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">technical breakdown of the Trojan</a> on our expert blog Securelist.</p>
<h2>How not to fall victim</h2>
<p>If you handle finances, and especially cryptocurrency, be wary of messages that try to persuade you to install programs from untrusted sources. In addition, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/internet-security?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kismd___" target="_blank">make sure your devices are secure</a> — in particular those you use for cryptocurrency transactions. A reliable security solution will help in cases when simple attentiveness isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Kaspersky has unveiled a significant spike in activity from a malicious spam e-mail campaign, which spreads Emotet and Qbot malware and targets corporate users.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our experts have detected significant growth in complex malicious spam e-mails targeting organizations in various countries. The number of these malicious e-mails grew from around 3000 in February 2022 to approximately 30,000 in March. So far, our technologies have detected malicious e-mails written in English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovenian and Spanish languages.</p>
<h2>How cybercriminals infect victim&#8217;s devices</h2>
<p>Cybercriminals allegedly intercept active e-mail conversations on business matters and send the recipients an e-mail containing either a malicious file or a link in order to infect their devices with a banking trojan. Such scheme makes those messages harder to detect and increases the chances that recipient will fall for the trick.</p>
<p>Some letters that cybercriminals send to the recipients contains a malicious attachment. In other cases, it has a link which leads to a file placed in a legitimate popular cloud-hosting service. Often, malware is contained in an encrypted archive, with the password mentioned in the e-mail body. To convince users to open attachment or download the file via the link, the attackers usually state that it contains some important information, such as a commercial offer.</p>
<p>Our experts have concluded that these e-mails are being distributed as part of a coordinated campaign that aims to spread banking Trojans.</p>
<h2>What kind of malware attackers are using and how dangerous are they?</h2>
<p>In most cases when victims opens a malicious document, it downloads and launches the <a href="https://securelist.com/qakbot-technical-analysis/103931/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qbot</a> malware, but our experts has also observed that some of these documents download <a href="https://securelist.com/emotet-modules-and-recent-attacks/106290/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emotet</a> instead. Both malware strains are capable of stealing users&#8217; data, collecting data on an infected corporate network, spreading further in the network, and installing ransomware or other Trojans on other network devices. Qbot also can access and steal e-mails.</p>
<h2>How to stay safe</h2>
<p>In order to stay safe from attacks by Qbot and Emotet (or any other malware spreading via e-mail), we recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing a reliable <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/small-to-medium-business-security/mail-security-appliance?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">security solution on a mail gateway level</a> — it will automatically filter out spam and malicious messages before end-users even have a chance to make a mistake.</li>
<li>Providing your staff with basic <a href="https://k-asap.com/en/?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kasap___" target="_blank">cybersecurity hygiene training</a> — it can teach them to spot cybercriminal behavior (for example to know that password in the same e-mail with the encrypted archive can serve only one purpose — to deceive antimalware technologies).</li>
<li>Conducting simulated attacks to ensure that your employees know how to distinguish phishing and malicious e-mails and genuine ones.</li>
<li>Using a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/small-to-medium-business-security?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">security solution</a> on every endpoint that is connected to the Internet. In this case if your staff fall victim to an attack, it can prevent a file from opening or a malicious link from working.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Decryptor for Yanluowang malware | Kaspersky official blog</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Kaspersky experts have found a way to decrypt files encrypted by Yanluowang ransomware.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We generally advise ransomware victims not to despair and not to delete any files – even if nothing helps in recovering them immediately. After all, one day the police might seize the attackers&#8217; infrastructure, or researchers might uncover flaws in the malware algorithms. An illustration of the latter is Kaspersky&#8217;s analysis of the Yanluowang ransomware. Our experts found a vulnerability that allows file recovery without the attackers&#8217; key — under certain conditions.</p>
<h2>How to decrypt files encrypted by Yanluowang</h2>
<p>The vulnerability in the Yanluowang malware allows file decryption with the help of a known-plaintext attack. This method overcomes the encryption algorithm if two versions of the same text are available: one clean, one encrypted. So if the victim has clean copies of some of the encrypted files, or knows where to get them, our upgraded <a href="https://noransom.kaspersky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rannoh Decryptor</a> can analyze them and recover the rest of the information.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one snag: Yanluowang corrupts files slightly differently depending on their size. It encrypts small files (less than 3GB) completely, and large ones partially. So their decryption requires clean files of different sizes. For files smaller than 3GB, it&#8217;s enough to have the original and an encrypted version of the file of a size of 1024 bytes or more. To recover files larger than 3GB, however, original files of the appropriate size are needed. However, if you find a clean file larger than 3GB, it will generally be possible to recover all the information affected.</p>
<h2>What is Yanluowang and why is it dangerous?</h2>
<p>Yanluowang is relatively new ransomware, which unknown attackers use to target large companies. It was first <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-yanluowang-ransomware-used-in-targeted-enterprise-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> late last year. To trigger the encryption process, the malware must receive the corresponding arguments, which suggests that an operator controls the attack manually. To date, victims of Yanluowang include companies in the U.S., Brazil and Turkey.</p>
<p>For technical details about Yanluowang, as well as indicators of compromise, see <a href="https://securelist.com/how-to-recover-files-encrypted-by-yanlouwang/106332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Securelist post</a>.</p>
<h2>How to guard against Yanluowang</h2>
<p>For basic protection against ransomware, follow our standard set of tips: always keep software up-to-date; save data backups to offline storage; provide <a href="https://k-asap.com/en/?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kasap___" target="_blank">employees with basic cybersecurity training</a>; and furnish all connected devices <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/small-to-medium-business-security?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">with adequate protection against ransomware</a>.</p>
<p>However, given targeted attacks — and even manually controlled ones — you need a comprehensive security approach. So our experts additionally recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring outgoing traffic to timely detect suspicious connections;</li>
<li>Conducting regular cybersecurity audits;</li>
<li>Supplying SOC employees with <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">current cyberthreat data</a>;</li>
<li>Engaging <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/enterprise-security/managed-detection-and-response?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">third-party experts</a> if needed.</li>
</ul>
