The cyberspies compromised a small percentage of HPE mailboxes belonging to individuals in our cybersecurity, go-to-market, business segments, and other functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Microsoft was able to identify these attacks in log data by reviewing Exchange Web Services (EWS) activity and using our audit logging features, combined with our extensive knowledge of Midnight Blizzard.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team. &#8220;Using the information gained from Microsoft’s investigation into Midnight Blizzard, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has identified that the same actor has been targeting other organizations and, as part of our usual notification processes, we have begun notifying these targeted organizations.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Midnight Blizzard group uses a variety of TTPs to gain initial access, perform lateral movement, and maintain persistence. It focuses on gathering intelligence in support of Russian foreign policy interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group was observed using multiple initial access methods, including stolen credentials and supply chain attacks. The group was spotted exploiting on-premises environments to laterally move to the cloud, and service providers’ trust chain to gain access to downstream customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Midnight Blizzard is also adept at identifying and abusing OAuth applications to move laterally across cloud environments and for post-compromise activity, such as email collection.&#8221; continues the report. &#8220;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/investigate-risky-oauth\">OAuth</a> is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization that enables applications to get access to data and resources based on permissions set by a user.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midnight Blizzard employed residential proxies to obfuscate connections and evade detection. Microsoft emphasizes the importance for organizations to implement measures to safeguard against rogue OAuth applications and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/124006/hacking/microsoft-warns-password-spraying-attacks.html\">password spraying</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft did not name other organizations hit by Midnight Blizzard. The IT giant states that the investigation is still ongoing, and it plans to provide additional details in the future as appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, cyberespionage)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"158164"}},{"title":"Watch out, experts warn of a critical flaw in Jenkins","link":"https://securityaffairs.com/158151/security/jenkins-critical-flaw.html","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},"pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 10:53:14 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Breaking News"},{"#cdata-section":"Security"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2024-23897"},{"#cdata-section":"Hacking"},{"#cdata-section":"hacking news"},{"#cdata-section":"information security news"},{"#cdata-section":"IT Information Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Jenkins"},{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},{"#cdata-section":"Security Affairs"},{"#cdata-section":"Security News"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://securityaffairs.com/?p=158151"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Jenkins maintainers addressed several security vulnerabilities, including a critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw.

The vulnerability was reported by the researcher Yaniv Nizry from <a href=\"https://streaklinks.com/B1DRCrzb25z8bLu4uA4a-8s-/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonarsource.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sonar</a> who wrote a <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/excessive-expansion-uncovering-critical-security-vulnerabilities-in-jenkins/\">detailed analysis</a> of the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenkins has a built-in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/\">command line interface (CLI)</a>&nbsp;to access the platform from a script or shell environment. The open-source software uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke/args4j\">args4j library</a>&nbsp;to parse CLI command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller. The parser uses a functionality that replaces the &#8216;@&#8217;&nbsp;character followed by a file path in an argument with the content of the file (&#8216;expandAtFiles&#8217;). This feature is enabled by default and Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An attacker can abuse the default character encoding of the Jenkins controller process to read arbitrary files on the controller file system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An attacker with &#8220;Overall/Read&#8221; permission can read entire files, while an attacker without it can read the first three lines of the files depending on the CLI commands.<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some notes from the <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/#SECURITY-3314\"><strong>advisory</strong></a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attackers with Overall/Read permission can read entire files.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attackers&nbsp;<strong>without</strong>&nbsp;Overall/Read permission can read the first few lines of files. The number of lines that can be read depends on available CLI commands. As of publication of this advisory, the Jenkins security team has found ways to read the first three lines of files in recent releases of Jenkins without having any plugins installed, and has not identified any plugins that would increase this line count.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The maintainers pointed out that exploiting this flaw makes it possible to read binary files containing cryptographic keys used for various Jenkins features, even with some limitations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the attacker has obtained the binary secrets it can conduct multiple attacks, including Remote code execution via Resource Root URLs, Remote code execution via &#8220;Remember me&#8221; cookie, Remote code execution via stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through build logs, Remote code execution via CSRF protection bypass, Decrypt secrets stored in Jenkins, Delete any item in Jenkins, Download a Java heap dump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue has been addressed in versions 2.442, LTS 2.426.3 by disabling the command parser feature.<gwmw style=\"display: none; background-color: transparent;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display: none; background-color: transparent;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advisory also recommends to turn off access to the CLI as a workaround.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;<strong>hacking, RCE)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-alternates: inherit; font-variant-position: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; font-family: &quot;open sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: collapse;\"></p><div><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-weight: 700; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\"></span></div><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-alternates: inherit; font-variant-position: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; font-family: &quot;open sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: collapse;\"></p><gwmw style=\"display: none; background-color: transparent;\"></gwmw></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"158151"}},{"title":"Pwn2Own Automotive 2024 Day 2 – Tesla hacked again","link":"https://securityaffairs.com/158141/hacking/pwn2own-automotive-2024-day-two.html","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},"pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:32:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Breaking News"},{"#cdata-section":"Hacking"},{"#cdata-section":"hacking news"},{"#cdata-section":"information security news"},{"#cdata-section":"IT Information Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},{"#cdata-section":"Pwn2Own Automotive 2024"},{"#cdata-section":"Security Affairs"},{"#cdata-section":"Security News"},{"#cdata-section":"Tesla"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://securityaffairs.com/?p=158141"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Researchers hacked the Tesla infotainment system and found 24 zero-days on day 2 of Pwn2Own Automotive 2024 hacking competition.

These groups, while maintaining anonymity, offer capabilities like negotiation support, phishing campaigns, and initial access brokerage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Double Jeopardy in Post-breach Exploitation:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybercriminals are leveraging &#8216;Double Jeopardy&#8217; tactics, weaponizing a single attack multiple times. This is achieved through the reuse of publicly available data and the sharing of stolen data across various threat groups, complicating attribution and response efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future Victimology Techniques: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilization of data from previous breaches to streamline future target identification, as seen with <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/146132/cyber-crime/black-basta-ransomware-hit-abb.html\">BlackBasta</a> and <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/147002/cyber-crime/blacksuit-similar-royal-ransomware.html\">BlackSuit</a> groups.

Tactics include explicit data publication and aggressive online shaming campaigns, adding a psychological dimension to the extortion process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Increased Law Enforcement Actions and Takedowns:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year witnessed a rise in law enforcement activities targeting ransomware groups, reflecting improved digital forensic techniques and international cooperation in cybercrime response. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conti’s Persistent Influence: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its dismantlement, Conti&#8217;s operational methodologies continue to influence current ransomware activities. The adaptation and use of Conti&#8217;s source code by groups like BlackSuit and BlackBasta demonstrate the enduring impact of this group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experimentations in Malware Locker/Loader Technology:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ransomware groups are experimenting with various malware lockers and loaders to enhance operational efficacy and evade detection. The transition of the Royal group to BlackSuit and BlackBasta&#8217;s use of Pikabot and DarkGate exemplify this trend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exploitation of the Citrix Bleed Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/153016/security/citrix-warns-patch-cve-2023-4966.html\">CVE 2023-4966</a>): </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The widespread exploitation of the Citrix Bleed vulnerability by groups like BlackSuit, BlackBasta, ALPHV, and LockBit 3.0, particularly targeting government and defense sectors, underscores the trend of exploiting critical software vulnerabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 trends noted by RedSense indicate a complex, chaotic and highly entangled year for ransomware. What we have found indicates that the threat ecosystem is experiencing massive internal shifts which may be sign that it will be unrecognizable by year&#8217;s end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Author Bio</strong>: Marley Smith currently works on the Intelligence Team of the cybersecurity and threat prevention firm RedSense.
