Image: Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></div>\n<p>The allegations against Ermakov mark the first time Australia has sanctioned a cybercriminal. The documents released by the Australian government included multiple photos of Mr. Ermakov, and it was clear they wanted to send a message that this was personal.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why. The attackers who broke into Medibank in October 2022 stole 9.7 million records on current and former Medibank customers. When the company refused to pay a $10 million ransom demand, the hackers selectively leaked highly sensitive health records, including those tied to abortions, HIV and alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government says Ermakov and the other actors behind the Medibank hack are believed to be linked to the Russia-backed cybercrime gang <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/revil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>REvil</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;REvil was among the most notorious cybercrime gangs in the world until July 2021 when they disappeared. REvil is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation and generally motivated by financial gain,&#8221; a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2041\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> from the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> reads. &#8220;REvil ransomware has been deployed on approximately 175,000 computers worldwide, with at least $200 million paid in ransom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sanctions say Ermakov went by multiple aliases on Russian cybercrime forums, including <strong>GustaveDore</strong>, <strong>JimJones</strong>, and Blade Runner. A search on the handle GustaveDore at the cyber intelligence platform <a href=\"https://www.intel471.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intel 471</a> shows this user created a ransomware affiliate program in November 2021 called <strong>Sugar</strong> (a.k.a.

If this name sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because in December 2023 KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/12/ten-years-later-new-clues-in-the-target-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identified Mr. Shefel as &#8220;Rescator,&#8221;</a> the cybercriminal identity tied to tens of millions of payment cards that were stolen in 2013 and 2014 from big box retailers <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/target-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target</a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=home+depot+breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Depot</a>, among others.</p>\n<p>How close was the connection between GustaveDore and Mr. Shefel? The Treasury Department&#8217;s sanctions page says Ermakov used the email address <strong>ae.ermak@yandex.ru</strong>. A search for this email at <a href=\"https://www.domaintools.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DomainTools.com</a> shows it was used to register just one domain name: <strong>millioner1[.]com</strong>. DomainTools further finds that a phone number tied to Mr. Shefel (79856696666) was used to register two domains: <strong>millioner[.]pw</strong>, and <strong>shtazi[.]net</strong>.<span id=\"more-66177\"></span></p>\n<p>The December 2023 story here that outed Mr. Shefel as Rescator noted that Shefel recently changed his last name to &#8220;<strong>Lenin</strong>&#8221; and had launched a service called Lenin[.]biz that sells physical USSR-era Ruble notes bearing the image of Vladimir Lenin, the founding father of the Soviet Union. The Instagram account for Mr. Shefel includes images of stacked USSR-era Ruble notes, as well as multiple links to Shtazi.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66193\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66193\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-66193\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shefelinstagram.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shefelinstagram.png 1245w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shefelinstagram-768x537.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shefelinstagram-782x547.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shefelinstagram-100x70.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-66193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Instagram account of Mikhail Borisovich Shefel, aka MikeMike aka Rescator.</p></div>\n<p>Intel 471&#8217;s research revealed Ermakov was affiliated in some way with REvil because the stolen Medibank data was published on a blog that had one time been controlled by REvil affiliates who carried out attacks and paid an affiliate fee to the gang.</p>\n<p>But by the time of the Medibank hack, the REvil group had mostly scattered after a series of high-profile attacks led to the group being disrupted by law enforcement. In November 2021, <strong>Europol</strong> <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/five-affiliates-to-sodinokibi/revil-unplugged\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it arrested seven REvil affiliates who collectively made more than $230 million worth of ransom demands since 2019. At the same time, U.S. authorities <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/revil-ransom-arrest-6m-seizure-and-10m-reward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unsealed two indictments against a pair of accused REvil cybercriminals</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The posting of Medibank&#8217;s data on that blog, however, indicated a connection with that group, although the connection wasn&#8217;t clear at the time,&#8221; Intel 471 wrote. &#8220;This makes sense in retrospect, as Ermakov&#8217;s group had also been a REvil affiliate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is easy to dismiss sanctions like these as ineffective, because as long as Mr. Ermakov remains in Russia he has little to fear of arrest. However, his alleged role as an apparent top member of REvil paints a target on him as someone who likely possesses large sums of cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://media3.risky.biz/RB733.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> <strong>Patrick Gray</strong>, the Australian co-host and founder of the security news podcast <strong>Risky Business</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a few people poo-poohing the sanctions&#8230;but the sanctions component is actually less important than the doxing component,&#8221; Gray said. &#8220;Because this guy&#8217;s life just got a lot more complicated. He&#8217;s probably going to have to pay some bribes to stay out of trouble. Every single criminal in Russia now knows he is a vulnerable 33 year old with an absolute ton of bitcoin. So this is not a happy time for him.&#8221;</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/who-is-alleged-medibank-hacker-aleksandr-ermakov/feed/","slash:comments":"5"},{"title":"Using Google Search to Find Software Can Be Risky","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 18:38:43 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"A Little Sunshine"},{"#cdata-section":"Latest Warnings"},{"#cdata-section":"Web Fraud 2.0"},{"#cdata-section":"domaintools"},{"#cdata-section":"google"},{"#cdata-section":"malvertising"},{"#cdata-section":"Sentinel One"},{"#cdata-section":"Tom Hegel"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=66169"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Google continues to struggle with cybercriminals running malicious ads on its search platform to trick people into downloading booby-trapped copies of popular free software applications.

A review at <strong>DomainTools.com</strong> show this domain is the newest (registered Jan. 19, 2024) of more than 200 domains at the Internet address <strong>93.190.143[.]252</strong> that are confusingly similar to popular software titles, including <strong>dashlane-project[.]com</strong>, <strong>filezillasoft[.]com</strong>, <strong>keepermanager[.]com</strong>, and <strong>libreofficeproject[.]com</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some of the domains at this Netherlands host appear to be little more than software review websites that steal content from established information sources in the IT world, including <strong>Gartner</strong>, <strong>PCWorld</strong>, <strong>Slashdot</strong> and <strong>TechRadar</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other domains at 93.190.143[.]252 do serve actual software downloads, but none of them are likely to be malicious if one visits the sites through direct navigation. If one visits <strong>openai-project[.]org</strong> and downloads a copy of the popular Windows desktop management application <strong>Rainmeter</strong>, for example, the file that is downloaded has the same exact file signature as the real Rainmeter installer available from rainmeter.net.</p>\n<p>But this is only a ruse, says <strong>Tom Hegel</strong>, principal threat researcher at the security firm <strong>Sentinel One</strong>. Hegel has been tracking these malicious domains for more than a year, and he said the seemingly benign software download sites will periodically turn evil, swapping out legitimate copies of popular software titles with backdoored versions that will allow cybercriminals to remotely commander the systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re using automation to pull in fake content, and they&#8217;re rotating in and out of hosting malware,&#8221; Hegel said, noting that the malicious downloads may only be offered to visitors who come from specific geographic locations, like the United States. &#8220;In the malicious ad campaigns we&#8217;ve seen tied to this group, they would wait until the domains gain legitimacy on the search engines, and then flip the page for a day or so and then flip back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In February 2023, Hegel <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/malvirt-net-virtualization-thrives-in-malvertising-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-authored a report</a> on this same network, which Sentinel One has dubbed <strong>MalVirt </strong>(a play on &#8220;malvertising&#8221;). They concluded that the surge in malicious ads spoofing various software products was directly responsible for a surge in malware infections from infostealer trojans like <strong>IcedID</strong>, <strong>Redline Stealer</strong>, <strong>Formbook</strong> and <strong>AuroraStealer</strong>.<span id=\"more-66169\"></span></p>\n<p>Hegel noted that the spike in malicious software-themed ads came not long after Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/22/microsoft-office-macros-blocked-default/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEKr4R6wZw5XUbrv_xvjmVkpsEf9UvwgV8lwVNi1nqV1po-Cl6MF9o0VpTr2dEogYWi3BRlp54CPBRPvfxnmXSq_4vcFaeZTAY2ZiC_wFAvD1Ui1A6eYhnhbcZrk_Zf2GdErhA0AwnygyxGK10oipqRf1vF4NDTfeASLMGg_idWf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">started blocking by default Office macros</a> in documents downloaded from the Internet. He said the volume of the current malicious ad campaigns from this group appears to be relatively low compared to a year ago.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It appears to be same campaign continuing,&#8221; Hegel said. &#8220;Last January, every Google search for &#8216;Autocad&#8217; led to something bad. Now, it&#8217;s like they&#8217;re paying Google to get one out of every dozen of searches. My guess it&#8217;s still continuing because of the up-and-down [of the] domains hosting malware and then looking legitimate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several of the websites at this Netherlands host (93.190.143[.]252) are currently blocked by Google&#8217;s Safebrowsing technology, and labeled with a conspicuous red warning saying the website will try to foist malware on visitors who ignore the warning and continue.</p>\n<p>But it remains a mystery why Google has not similarly blocked more than 240+ other domains at this same host, or else removed them from its search index entirely. Especially considering there is nothing else but these domains hosted at that Netherlands IP address, and because they have all remained at that address for the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, Google said maintaining a safe ads ecosystem and keeping malware off of its platforms is a priority across Google.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bad actors often employ sophisticated measures to conceal their identities and evade our policies and enforcement, sometimes showing Google one thing and users something else,&#8221; Google said in a written statement. &#8220;We’ve reviewed the ads in question, removed those that violated our policies, and suspended the associated accounts. We’ll continue to monitor and apply our protections.”</p>\n<p>Google says it removed 5.2 billion ads in 2022, and restricted more than 4.3 billion ads and suspended over 6.7 million advertiser accounts. The company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2022_google_ads_safety_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">latest ad safety report</a> says Google in 2022 blocked or removed 1.36 billion advertisements for violating its abuse policies.</p>\n<p>Some of the domains referenced in this story were included in Sentinel One&#8217;s February 2023 report, but dozens more have been added since, such as those spoofing the official download sites for <strong>Corel Draw</strong>, <strong>Github Desktop</strong>, <strong>Roboform</strong> and <strong>Teamviewer</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=82229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This October 2023 report</a> on the FreeCAD user forum came from a user who reported downloading a copy of the software from freecadsoft[.]com after seeing the site promoted at the top of a Google search result for &#8220;freecad.&#8221; Almost a month later, another FreeCAD user reported getting stung by the same scam.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This got me,&#8221; FreeCAD forum user &#8220;Matterform&#8221; wrote on Nov. 19, 2023. &#8220;Please leave a report with Google so it can flag it.

A <a href=\"https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/Band_Manager.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Band Manager</a> is responsible for overseeing the delivery of all Band programs, including community health services, education, housing, social assistance, and administration.</p>\n<p>Barker told KrebsOnSecurity that during the week of March 31, 2023 he and the director of the Band&#8217;s daycare program discussed the need to purchase items for the community before the program&#8217;s budget expired for the year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a rush to purchase items on the Fiscal Year 2023 timeline as the year ended on March 31,&#8221; Barker recalled.</p>\n<p>Barker said he bought seven &#8220;Step2 All Around Playtime Patio with Canopy&#8221; sets from a seller on <strong>Amazon.ca</strong>, using his payment card on file to pay nearly $2,000 for the items.</p>\n<p>On the morning of April 7, Barker&#8217;s Facebook account received several nasty messages from an Ontario woman he&#8217;d never met. She demanded to know why he&#8217;d hacked her <strong>Walmart</strong> account and used it to buy things that were being shipped to his residence. Barker shared a follow-up message from the woman, who later apologized for losing her temper.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66119\" style=\"width: 319px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66119\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66119\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tri-fbmsg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"309\" height=\"603\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-66119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of several messages from the Ontario woman whose Walmart account was used to purchase the goods that Barker ordered from Amazon.</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;If this is not the person who did this to me, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m pissed,&#8221; the lady from Ontario said. &#8220;This order is being delivered April 14th to the address above. If not you, then someone who has the same name. Now I feel foolish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On April 12, 2023, before the Amazon purchases had even arrived at his home, Barker received a call from an investigator with the <strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</strong> (RCMP), who said Barker urgently needed to come down to the local RCMP office for an interview related to &#8220;an investigation.&#8221; Barker said the officer wouldn&#8217;t elaborate at the time on the nature of the investigation, and that he told the officer he was in Halifax for several days but could meet after his return home.</p>\n<p>According to Barker, the investigator visited his home anyway the following day and began questioning his wife, asking about his whereabouts, his work, and when he might return home.</p>\n<p>On April 14, six boxes arrived to partially fulfill his Amazon order; another box was delayed, and the Amazon.ca seller he&#8217;d purchased from said the remaining box was expected to ship the following week. Barker said he was confused because all six boxes came from Walmart instead of Amazon, and the shipping labels had his name and address on them but carried a contact phone number in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Three days later, the investigator called again, demanding he submit to an interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He then asked where my wife was and what her name is,&#8221; Barker said. &#8220;He wanted to know her itinerary for the day. I am now alarmed and frightened &#8212; this doesn&#8217;t feel right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barker said he inquired with a local attorney about a consultation, but that the RCMP investigator showed up at his house before he could speak to the lawyer. The investigator began taking pictures of the boxes from his Amazon order.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The [investigator] derisively asked why would anyone order so many play sets?&#8221; Barker said. &#8220;I started to give the very logical answer that we are helping families improve their children’s home life and learning for toddlers when he cut me off and gave the little speech about giving a statement after my arrest. He finally told me that he believes that I used someone&#8217;s credit card in Ontario to purchase the Walmart products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Eager to clear his name, Barker said he shared with the police copies of his credit card bills and purchase history at Amazon. But on April 21, the investigator called again to say he was coming to arrest Barker for theft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He said that if I was home at five o&#8217;clock then he would serve the papers at the house and it would go easy and I wouldn’t have to go to the station,&#8221; Barker recalled. &#8220;If I wasn’t home, then he would send a search team to locate me and drag me to the station. He said he would kick the door down if I didn’t answer my phone. He said he had every right to break our door down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barker said he briefly conferred with an attorney about how to handle the arrest. Later that evening, the RCMP arrived with five squad cars and six officers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked if handcuffs were necessary – there is no danger of violence,&#8221; Barker said. &#8220;I was going to cooperate. His response was to turn me around and cuff me. He walked me outside and stood me beside the car for a full 4 or 5 minutes in full view of all the neighbors.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66160\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div.png 879w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div-768x506.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div-782x515.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>Barker believes he and the Ontario woman are both victims of triangulation fraud, and that someone likely hacked the Ontario woman&#8217;s Walmart account and added his name and address as a recipient.</p>\n<p>But he says he has since lost his job as a result of the arrest, and now he can&#8217;t find new employment because he has a criminal record. Barker&#8217;s former employer &#8212; Duncan&#8217;s First Nation &#8212; did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Canada, a criminal record is not a record of conviction, it&#8217;s a record of charges and that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t work now,&#8221; Barker said. &#8220;Potential employers never find out what the nature of it is, they just find out that I have a criminal arrest record.&#8221;<span id=\"more-65740\"></span></p>\n<p>Barker said that right after his arrest, the RCMP called the Ontario woman and told her they&#8217;d solved the crime and arrested the perpetrator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They even told her my employer had put me on administrative leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Surely, they&#8217;re not allowed to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, the woman whose Walmart account was used to fraudulently purchase the child play sets said she&#8217;s not convinced this was a case of triangulation fraud. She declined to elaborate on why she believed this, other than to say the police told her Barker was a bad guy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think triangulation fraud was used in this case,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My actual Walmart.ca account was hacked and an order was placed on my account, using my credit card. The only thing Mr. Barker did was to order the item to be delivered to his address in Alberta.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barker shared with this author all of the documentation he gave to the RCMP, including screenshots of his Amazon.ca account showing that the items in dispute were sold by a seller named &#8220;<strong>Adavio</strong>,&#8221; and that the merchant behind this name was based in Turkey.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66122\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"751\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo.png 954w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo-768x449.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo-782x457.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" /></p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/sp?seller=A2H83L9DLFWTSS&amp;marketplaceID=A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adavio account</a> belongs to a young computer engineering student and &#8220;SEO expert&#8221; based in Adana, Turkey who did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Amazon.ca said it conducted an investigation and found that Mr. Barker never filed a complaint about the seller or transaction in question. The company noted that Adavio currently has a feedback rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Amazon works hard to provide customers with a great experience and it&#8217;s our commitment to go above and beyond to make things right for customers,&#8221; Amazon.ca said in a written statement. &#8220;If a customer has an issue with an order, they may flag to Amazon through our <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Customer Service</a> page.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barker said when he went to file a complaint with Amazon last year he could no longer find the Adavio account on the website, and that the site didn&#8217;t have a category for the type of complaint he wanted to file.</p>\n<p>When he first approached KrebsOnSecurity about his plight last summer, Barker said he didn&#8217;t want any media attention to derail the chances of having his day in court, and confronting the RCMP investigator with evidence proving that he was being wrongfully prosecuted and maligned.</p>\n<p>But a week before his court date arrived at the end of November 2023, prosecutors announced the charges against him would be stayed, meaning they had no immediate plans to prosecute the case further but that the investigation could still be reopened at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>The RCMP declined to comment for this story, other than to confirm they had issued a stay of proceedings in the case.</p>\n<p>Barker says the stay has left him in legal limbo &#8212; denying him the ability to clear his name, while giving the RCMP a free pass for a botched investigation. He says he has considered suing the investigating officer for defamation, but has been told by his attorney that the bar for success in such cases against the government is extremely high.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a 56-year-old law-abiding citizen, and I haven&#8217;t broken any laws,&#8221; Barker said, wondering aloud who would be stupid enough to use someone else&#8217;s credit card and have the stolen items shipped directly to their home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Their putting a stay on the proceedings without giving any evidence or explanation allows them to cover up bad police work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all so stupid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Triangulation fraud is hardly a new thing. KrebsOnSecurity first wrote about it <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/how-carders-can-use-ebay-as-a-virtual-atm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from an e-commerce vendor&#8217;s perspective in 2015</a>, but the scam predates that story by many years and is now a well-understood problem. The Canadian authorities should either let Mr. Barker have his day in court, or drop the charges altogether.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/canadian-man-stuck-in-triangle-of-e-commerce-fraud/feed/","slash:comments":"67"},{"title":"E-Crime Rapper ‘Punchmade Dev’ Debuts Card Shop","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/e-crime-rapper-punchmade-dev-debuts-card-shop/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/e-crime-rapper-punchmade-dev-debuts-card-shop/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:00:40 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"A Little Sunshine"},{"#cdata-section":"Ne'er-Do-Well News"},{"#cdata-section":"Web Fraud 2.0"},{"#cdata-section":"Constella Intelligence"},{"#cdata-section":"Devon Turner"},{"#cdata-section":"DevTakeFlight"},{"#cdata-section":"DevTakeFlightBeats Inc."},{"#cdata-section":"DomainTools.com"},{"#cdata-section":"NBA 2K17"},{"#cdata-section":"OBN Dev"},{"#cdata-section":"OBN Group LLC"},{"#cdata-section":"Punchmade Dev"},{"#cdata-section":"Punchmade LLC"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=66130"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"The rapper and social media personality Punchmade Dev is perhaps best known for his flashy videos singing the praises of a cybercrime lifestyle.

Experts say the development could make it easier for victims of crypto heists to recover stolen funds through the courts without having to wait years for law enforcement to take notice or help.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-47805\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/suingyou.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"691\" height=\"456\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Dellone</strong>, a healthcare worker in Fresno, Calif., asserts that thieves stole his bitcoin on Dec. 14, 2021, by executing an unauthorized SIM-swap that involved an employee at his mobile phone provider who switched Dellone&#8217;s phone number over to a new device the attackers controlled.</p>\n<p>Dellone says the crooks then used his phone number to break into his account at <strong>Coinbase</strong> and siphon roughly $100,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which alleges the company ignored multiple red flags, and that it should have detected and stopped the theft. Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Working with experts who track the flow of funds stolen in cryptocurrency heists, Dellone&#8217;s lawyer <strong>Ethan Mora </strong>identified a bitcoin wallet that was the ultimate destination of his client&#8217;s stolen crypto. Mora says his client has since been made aware that the bitcoin address in question is embroiled in an ongoing federal investigation into a cryptocurrency theft ring.</p>\n<p>Mora said it&#8217;s unclear if the bitcoin address that holds his client&#8217;s stolen money is being held by the government or by the anonymous hackers. Nevertheless, he is pursuing a novel legal strategy that allows his client to serve notice of the civil suit to that bitcoin address &#8212; and potentially win a default judgment to seize his client&#8217;s funds within &#8212; <em>without knowing the identity of his attackers or anything about the account holder.</em></p>\n<p>In a civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages, a default judgment is usually entered on behalf of the plaintiff if the defendant fails to respond to the complaint within a specified time. Assuming that the cybercriminals who stole the money don&#8217;t dispute Dellone&#8217;s claim, experts say the money could be seized by cryptocurrency exchanges if the thieves ever tried to move it or spend it.</p>\n<p>The U.S. courts have generally held that if you&#8217;re going to sue someone, you have to provide some kind of meaningful and timely communication about that lawsuit to the defendant in a way that is reasonably likely to provide them notice.</p>\n<p>Not so long ago, you had track down your defendant and hire someone to physically serve them with a copy of the court papers. But legal experts say the courts have evolved their thinking in recent years about what constitutes meaningful service, and now allow notification via email.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 14, 2023, a federal judge in the Eastern District of California granted Dellone permission to serve notice of his lawsuit directly to the suspected hackers&#8217; bitcoin address &#8212; using a short message that was attached to roughly $100 worth of bitcoin Mora sent to the address.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions are public record, and each transaction can be sent along with an optional short message. The message uses what&#8217;s known as an &#8220;<a href=\"https://cryptoapis.io/blog/34-adding-metadata-to-your-bitcoin-transactions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OP RETURN</a>,&#8221; or an instruction of the Bitcoin scripting language that allows users to attach metadata to a transaction &#8212; and thus save it on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>In the $100 bitcoin transaction Mora sent to the disputed bitcoin address, the OP RETURN message read: &#8220;OSERVICE &#8211; SUMMONS, COMPLAINT U.S. Dist. E.D. Cal. LINK: <a href=\"https://t.ly/123cv01408_service\">t.ly/123cv01408_service</a>,&#8221; which is a short link to a copy of the lawsuit hosted on Google Drive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The courts are adapting to the new style of service of process,&#8221; said <strong>Mark Rasch</strong>, a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. &#8220;And that&#8217;s helpful and useful and necessary.&#8221;<span id=\"more-65312\"></span></p>\n<p>Rasch said Mora&#8217;s strategy could force the government to divulge information about their case, or else explain to a judge why the plaintiff shouldn&#8217;t be able to recover their stolen funds without further delay. Rasch said it could be that Dellone&#8217;s stolen crypto was seized as part of a government asset forfeiture, but that either way there is no reason Uncle Sam should hold some cybercrime victims&#8217; life savings indefinitely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The government doesn&#8217;t need the crypto as evidence, but in a forfeiture action the money goes to the government,&#8221; Rasch said. &#8220;But it was never the government&#8217;s money, and that doesn&#8217;t help the victim. The government should be providing information to the victims of cryptocurrency theft so that their attorneys can go get the money back themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Nick Bax</strong> is a security researcher who specializes in tracing the labyrinthine activity of criminals trying to use cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial instruments to launder the proceeds of cybercrime. Bax said Mora&#8217;s method could allow more victims to stake legitimate legal claims to their stolen funds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you get a default judgment against a bitcoin address, for example, and then down the road that bitcoin gets sent to an exchange that complies with or abides by U.S. court orders, then it&#8217;s yours,&#8221; Bax said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen funds with a court order on them get frozen by the exchanges that decided it made sense to comply with orders from a U.S. federal court.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bax&#8217;s research was featured in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Sept. 2023 story here</a> about how experts now believe it&#8217;s likely hackers are cracking open some of the password vaults stolen in the 2022 data breach at LastPass.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to a lot victims who have had life-changing amounts of money being seized and would like that money back,&#8221; Bax said. &#8220;A big goal here is just making civil cases more efficient. Because then people can help themselves and they don&#8217;t need to rely solely on law enforcement with its limited resources. And that&#8217;s really the goal: To scale this and make it economically viable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Dellone&#8217;s lawsuit may be the first time anyone has obtained approval from a federal judge to use bitcoin to notify another party of a civil action, the technique has been used in several recent unrelated cases involving other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and NFTs.</p>\n<p>The law firm DLAPiper <a href=\"https://www.dlapiper.com/en/insights/publications/2022/12/florida-court-allows-service-of-lawsuit-crypto-scammers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes</a> that in November 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida &#8220;authorized service of a lawsuit seeking the recovery of stolen digital assets by way of a non-fungible token or NFT containing the text of the complaint and summons, as well as a hyperlink to a website created by the plaintiffs containing all pleadings and orders in the action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In approving Dellone&#8217;s request for service via bitcoin transaction, the judge overseeing the case cited a recent New York Superior Court ruling in a John Doe case brought by victims seeking to unmask the crooks behind a $1.3 million cyberheist.</p>\n<p>In the New York case, the state trial court found it was acceptable for the plaintiffs to serve notice of the suit via cryptocurrency transactions because the defendants regularly used the Blockchain address to which the tokens were sent, and had recently done so. Also, the New York court found that because the account in question contained a significant sum of money, it was unlikely to be abandoned or forgotten.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thus the court inferred the defendants were likely to access the account in the future,&#8221; wrote <strong>Judge Helena M. March-Kuchta</strong>, for the Eastern District of California, summarizing the New York case. &#8220;Finally, the plaintiff had no alternative means of contacting these unknown defendants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Experts say regardless of the reason for a cryptocurrency theft or loss &#8212; whether it&#8217;s from a romance scam or a straight-up digital mugging &#8212; it&#8217;s important for victims to file an official report both with their local police and with the FBI&#8217;s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ic3.gov</a>). The IC3 collects reports on cybercrime and sometimes bundles victim reports into cases for DOJ/FBI prosecutors and investigators.</p>\n<p>The hard truth is that most victims will never see their stolen funds again. But sometimes federal investigators win minor victories and manage to seize or freeze crypto assets that are known to be associated with specific crimes and criminals. In those cases, the government will eventually make an effort to find, contact and in some cases remunerate known victims.</p>\n<p>It might take many years for this process to unfold. But if and when they do make that effort, federal investigators are likely to focus their energies and attention responding to victims who staked a claim and can support it with documentation.</p>\n<p>But have no illusions that any of this is likely to happen in a timeframe that is meaningful to victims in the short run. For example, in 2013 the U.S. government <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/05/u-s-government-seizes-libertyreserve-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seized the assets of the virtual currency Liberty Reserve</a>, massively disrupting a major vehicle for laundering the proceeds of cybercrime and other illegal activities.</p>\n<p>When the government offered remuneration to Liberty Reserve account holders who wished to make a financial loss claim and supply supporting documentation, KrebsOnSecurity filed a claim. There wasn&#8217;t money much in my Liberty Reserve account; I simply wanted to know how long it would take for federal investigators to follow up on my claim, or indeed if they would at all.</p>\n<p>In 2020 KrebsOnSecurity was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/a-light-at-the-end-of-liberty-reserves-demise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contacted by an investigator with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) who was seeking to discuss my claim. The investigator said they would have called sooner, but that it had taken that long for the IRS to gain legal access to the funds seized in the 2013 Liberty Reserve takedown.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/heres-some-bitcoin-oh-and-youve-been-served/feed/","slash:comments":"44"},{"title":"Meet Ika & Sal: The Bulletproof Hosting Duo from Hell","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/meet-ika-sal-the-bulletproof-hosting-duo-from-hell/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/meet-ika-sal-the-bulletproof-hosting-duo-from-hell/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 17:57:55 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"A Little Sunshine"},{"#cdata-section":"Breadcrumbs"},{"#cdata-section":"ad1@safe-mail.net"},{"#cdata-section":"Alexander Valerievich Grichishkin"},{"#cdata-section":"Andrey Skvortsov"},{"#cdata-section":"Cherepovets"},{"#cdata-section":"Constella Intelligence"},{"#cdata-section":"duanesburg central school district"},{"#cdata-section":"grichishkin@gmail.com"},{"#cdata-section":"Icami$"},{"#cdata-section":"Icamis"},{"#cdata-section":"icamis@4host.info"},{"#cdata-section":"Ika"},{"#cdata-section":"JabberZeuS"},{"#cdata-section":"nameservers.ru"},{"#cdata-section":"rescator"},{"#cdata-section":"Sal"},{"#cdata-section":"Salomon"},{"#cdata-section":"Spamdot"},{"#cdata-section":"Spamit"},{"#cdata-section":"tech@safe-mail.net"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=65945"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"In 2020, the United States brought charges against four men accused of building a bulletproof hosting empire that once dominated the Russian cybercrime industry and supported multiple organized cybercrime groups.

Collectively in control over millions of spam-spewing zombies, those botmasters also continuously harvested passwords and other data from infected machines.</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ll see in a moment, Salomon is now behind bars, in part because <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=cyberheist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he helped to rob dozens of small businesses in the United States</a> using some of those same harvested passwords. He is currently housed in a federal prison in Michigan, serving the final stretch of a 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p>But the identity and whereabouts of Icamis have remained a mystery to this author until recently. For years, security experts &#8212; and indeed, many top cybercriminals in the Spamit affiliate program &#8212; have expressed the belief that Sal and Icamis were likely the same person using two different identities. And there were many good reasons to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2010 Spamdot and its spam affiliate program Spamit were hacked, and its user database shows Sal and Icamis often accessed the forum from the same Internet address &#8212; usually from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherepovets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cherepovets</a>, an industrial town situated approximately 230 miles north of Moscow. Also, it was common for Icamis to reply when Spamdot members communicated a request or complaint to Sal, and vice versa.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66063\" style=\"width: 755px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66063\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-66063\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ru-map-chere.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"745\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ru-map-chere.png 939w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ru-map-chere-768x408.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ru-map-chere-782x416.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-66063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: maps.google.com</p></div>\n<p>Still, other clues suggested Icamis and Sal were two separate individuals. For starters, they frequently changed the status on their instant messenger clients at different times. Also, they each privately discussed with others having attended different universities.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity began researching Icamis&#8217;s real-life identity in 2012, but failed to revisit any of that research until recently. In December 2023, KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/12/ten-years-later-new-clues-in-the-target-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published new details about the identity of &#8220;Rescator,&#8221;</a> a Russian cybercriminal who is thought to be closely connected to the 2013 data breach at Target.</p>\n<p>That story mentioned Rescator&#8217;s real-life identity was exposed by Icamis in April 2013, as part of a lengthy farewell letter Ika wrote to Spamdot members wherein Ika said he was closing the forum and quitting the cybercrime business entirely.</p>\n<p>To no one&#8217;s shock, Icamis didn&#8217;t quit the business: He simply became more quiet and circumspect about his work, which increasingly was focused on helping crime groups siphon funds from U.S. bank accounts. But the Rescator story was a reminder that 10 years worth of research on who Ika/Icamis is in real life had been completely set aside.

But it&#8217;s clear that those anti-spam operations had a real and painful impact on spam revenues, and Salomon was obsessed with striking back at anti-spam groups, particularly Spamhaus.</p>\n<p>In 2007, Salomon collected more than $3,000 from botmasters affiliated with competing spam affiliate programs that wanted to see Spamhaus suffer, and the money was used to fund a week-long distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against Spamhaus and its online infrastructure. But rather than divert their spam botnets from their normal activity and thereby decrease sales, the botmasters voted to create a new DDoS botnet by purchasing installations of DDoS malware on thousands of already-hacked PCs (at a rate of $25 per 1,000 installs).</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-65945\"></span></p>\n<h2>SALOMON</h2>\n<p>As an affiliate of Spamdot, Salomon used the email address <strong>ad1@safe-mail.net</strong>, and the password <strong>19871987gr</strong>.

Of course, not if you count the many years I worked as a paperboy schlepping The Washington Post to dozens of homes in Springfield, Va. (as a young teen, I inherited a largish paper route handed down from my elder siblings).</p>\n<p>True story: At the time I was hired as a lowly copy aide by The Washington Post, all new hires &#8212; everyone from the mailroom and janitors on up to the executives &#8212; were invited to a formal dinner in the Executive Suite with the publisher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_E._Graham#:~:text=Graham%20became%20publisher%20of%20The,of%20The%20Washington%20Post%20Company.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don Graham</a>. On the evening of my new hires dinner, I was feeling underdressed, undershowered and out of place. After wolfing down some food, I tried to slink away to the elevator with another copy aide, but was pulled aside by the guy who hired me. &#8220;Hey Brian, not so fast! Come over and meet Don!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was 23 years old, and I had no clue what to say except to tell him that paper route story, and that I&#8217;d already been working for him for half my life. Mr. Graham laughed and told me that was the best thing he&#8217;d heard all day. Which of course made my week, and made me feel more at ease among the suits.<span id=\"more-66001\"></span></p>\n<p>I remain grateful to WaPo for instilling many skills, such as how to distill technobabble into plain English for a general audience. And how to make people the focus of highly technical stories. Because people &#8212; and their eternal struggles &#8212; are imminently relatable, regardless of whether one has a full grasp of the technical details.</p>\n<p>Words fail me when trying to describe how grateful I am that this whole independent reporter thing still works, financially and otherwise. I mostly just keep my head down researching stuff and sharing what I find, and somehow loads of people keep coming back to the site. As I like to say, I hope they let me keep doing this, because I&#8217;m certainly unqualified to do much else!</p>\n<p>Another milestone of sorts: We&#8217;ve now amassed more than 52,000 subscribers to our email newsletter, which is a fancy term for a plain text email that goes out immediately whenever a new story is published here. <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Subscribing is free</a>, we never share anyone&#8217;s email address, and we don&#8217;t send emails other than new story notifications (2-3 per week).</p>\n<p>A friendly reminder that while you may see ads (or spaces where ads otherwise would be) at the top of this website, all two-dozen or so ad creatives we run are vetted by me and served in-house.

Monaco</strong> said. &#8220;We will continue to prioritize disruptions and place victims at the center of our strategy to dismantle the ecosystem fueling cybercrime.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The DOJ reports that since BlackCat&#8217;s formation roughly 18 months ago, the crime group has targeted the computer networks of more than 1,000 victim organizations. BlackCat attacks usually involve encryption and theft of data; if victims refuse to pay a ransom, the attackers typically publish the stolen data on a BlackCat-linked darknet site.</p>\n<p>BlackCat formed by recruiting operators from several competing or disbanded ransomware organizations — including <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=REvil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REvil</a>, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=blackmatter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlackMatter</a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkside\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DarkSide</a>. The latter group was responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/darkside-ransomware-colonial-pipeline-response/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colonial Pipeline attack in May 2021</a> that caused nationwide fuel shortages and price spikes.</p>\n<p>Like many other ransomware operations, BlackCat operates under the &#8220;ransomware-as-a-service&#8221; model, where teams of developers maintain and update the ransomware code, as well as all of its supporting infrastructure. Affiliates are incentivized to attack high-value targets because they generally reap 60-80 percent of any payouts, with the remainder going to the crooks running the ransomware operation.</p>\n<p>BlackCat was able to briefly regain control over their darknet server today. Not long after the FBI&#8217;s seizure notice went live the homepage was &#8220;unseized&#8221; and retrofitted with a statement about the incident from the ransomware group&#8217;s perspective.<span id=\"more-65924\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65930\" style=\"width: 663px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65930\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65930\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blackcat-unseized.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"653\" height=\"622\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65930\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The message that was briefly on the homepage of the BlackCat ransomware group this morning.

The group also said it was formally removing any restrictions or discouragement against targeting hospitals or other critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of their actions, we are introducing new rules, or rather, we are removing ALL rules except one, you cannot touch the CIS [a common restriction against attacking organizations in Russia or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>]. You can now block hospitals, nuclear power plants, anything, anywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The crime group also said it was setting affiliate commissions at 90 percent, presumably to attract interest from potential affiliates who might otherwise be spooked by the FBI&#8217;s recent infiltration. BlackCat also promised that all &#8220;advertisers&#8221; under this new scheme would manage their affiliate accounts from data centers that are completely isolated from each other.</p>\n<p>BlackCat&#8217;s darknet site currently displays the FBI seizure notice.

Chang&#8217;s.</p></div>\n<p>Shortly after breaking the Target story, KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/whos-selling-credit-cards-from-target/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that Rescator appeared to be a hacker from Ukraine. Efforts to confirm my reporting with that individual ended when they declined to answer questions, and after I declined to accept a bribe of $10,000 not to run my story.</p>\n<p>That reporting was based on clues from an early Russian cybercrime forum in which a hacker named Rescator &#8212; using the same profile image that Rescator was known to use on other forums &#8212; claimed to have originally been known as &#8220;Helkern,&#8221; the nickname chosen by the administrator of a cybercrime forum called Darklife.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity began revisiting the research into Rescator&#8217;s real-life identity in 2018, after the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> unsealed an indictment that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/u-s-arrests-13-charges-36-in-infraud-cybercrime-forum-bust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">named a different Ukrainian man</a> as Helkern.</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to first recap why Rescator is thought to be so closely tied to the Target breach. For starters, the text string &#8220;Rescator&#8221; was found in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140120201116/https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analyzing-the-target-point-of-sale-malware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some of the malware</a> used in the Target breach. Investigators would later determine that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/home-depot-hit-by-same-malware-as-target/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a variant of the malware used in the Target breach</a> was used in 2014 to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/banks-credit-card-breach-at-home-depot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steal 56 million payment cards</a> from <strong>Home Depot</strong> customers. And once again, cards stolen in the Home Depot breach were sold exclusively at Rescator&#8217;s shops.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 25, 2013, two days before Target said the breach officially began, Rescator could be seen in instant messages hiring another forum member to verify 400,000 payment cards that Rescator claimed were freshly stolen.</p>\n<p>By the first week of December 2013, Rescator&#8217;s online store &#8212; <strong>rescator[.]la</strong> &#8212; was selling more than six million payment card records stolen from Target customers. Prior to the Target breach, Rescator had mostly sold much smaller batches of stolen card and identity data, and the website allowed cybercriminals to automate the sending of fraudulent wire transfers to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/money-mules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">money mules</a> based in Lviv, Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is <em>some</em> honor among thieves, and in the marketplace for stolen payment card data it is considered poor form to advertise a batch of cards as &#8220;yours&#8221; if you are merely reselling cards sold to you by a third-party card vendor or thief. When serious stolen payment card shop vendors wish to communicate that a batch of cards is uniquely their handiwork or that of their immediate crew, they refer to it as &#8220;our base.&#8221; And Rescator was quite clear in his advertisements that these millions of cards were obtained firsthand.</p>\n<h2>FLASHBACK</h2>\n<p>The new clues about Rescator&#8217;s identity came into focus when I revisited the reporting around an April 2013 story here that <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/04/who-wrote-the-flashback-os-x-worm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identified the author of the OSX Flashback Trojan</a>, an early Mac malware strain that quickly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(Trojan)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spread to more than 650,000 Mac computers worldwide in 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>That story about the Flashback author was possible because a source had obtained a Web browser authentication cookie for a founding member of a Russian cybercrime forum called <strong>BlackSEO</strong>. Anyone in possession of that cookie could then browse the invite-only BlackSEO forum and read the user&#8217;s private messages without having to log in.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19687\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19687\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-19687\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FlashbackBlackSEO.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FlashbackBlackSEO.png 946w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FlashbackBlackSEO-285x201.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FlashbackBlackSEO-600x424.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-19687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BlackSEO.com VIP member &#8220;Mavook&#8221; tells forum admin Ika in a private message that he is the Flashback author.</p></div>\n<p>The legitimate owner of that BlackSEO user cookie went by the nickname <strong>Ika</strong>, and Ika&#8217;s private messages on the forum showed he was close friends with the Flashback author. At the time, Ika also was the administrator of <strong>Pustota[.]pw</strong> &#8212; a closely-guarded Russian forum that counted among its members some of the world&#8217;s most successful and established spammers and malware writers.</p>\n<p>For many years, Ika held a key position at one of Russia&#8217;s largest Internet service providers, and his (mostly glowing) reputation as a reliable provider of web hosting to the Russian cybercrime community gave him an encyclopedic knowledge about nearly every major player in that scene at the time.</p>\n<p>The story on the Flashback author featured redacted screenshots that were taken from Ika&#8217;s BlackSEO account (see image above). The day after that story ran, Ika posted a farewell address to his mates, expressing shock and bewilderment over the apparent compromise of his BlackSEO account.</p>\n<p>In a lengthy post on April 4, 2013 titled &#8220;I DON&#8217;T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING,&#8221; Ika told Pustota forum members he was so spooked by recent events that he was closing the forum and quitting the cybercrime business entirely. Ika recounted how the Flashback story had come the same week that rival cybercriminals tried to &#8220;dox&#8221; him (their dox named the wrong individual, but included some of Ika&#8217;s more guarded identities).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that karma farted in my direction,&#8221; Ika said at the beginning of his post. Unbeknownst to Ika at the time, his Pustota forum also had been completely hacked that week, and a copy of its database shared with this author.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65789\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65789\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-65789\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye.png 1692w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye-768x315.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye-1536x629.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ika-pustota-goodbye-782x320.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65789\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Google translated version of the farewell post from Ika, the administrator of Pustota, a Russian language cybercrime forum focused on botnets and spam.

New applicants of this forum had to pay a non-refundable deposit, and receive vouches by three established cybercriminals already on the forum. Even if one managed to steal (or guess) a user&#8217;s DirectConnection password, the login page could not be reached unless the visitor also possessed a special browser certificate that the forum administrator gave only to approved members.</p>\n<p>In no uncertain terms, Ika declared that Rescator went by the nickname <strong>MikeMike</strong> on DirectConnection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I did not want to bring any of this to real life. Especially since I knew the patron of the clowns &#8211; specifically Pavel Vrublevsky. Yes, I do state with confidence that the man with the nickname Rescator a.k.a. MikeMike with his partner <strong>Pipol</strong> have been Pavel Vrublevsky&#8217;s puppets for a long time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pavel Vrublevsky</strong> is a convicted cybercriminal who became famous as the CEO of the Russian e-payments company <strong>ChronoPay</strong>, which specialized in facilitating online payments for a variety of &#8220;high-risk&#8221; businesses, including gambling, pirated Mp3 files, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/03/chronopays-scareware-diaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rogue antivirus software</a> and &#8220;male enhancement&#8221; pills.</p>\n<p>As detailed in my 2014 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Spam Nation</em></a>, Vrublevsky not-so-secretly ran a pharmacy affiliate spam program called <strong>Rx-Promotion</strong>, which <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/02/russian-cops-crash-pill-pusher-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paid spammers and virus writers</a> to blast out tens of billions of junk emails advertising generic Viagra and controlled pharmaceuticals like pain relief medications. Much of my reporting on Vrublevsky&#8217;s cybercrime empire came from several years worth of internal ChronoPay emails and documents that were leaked online in 2010 and 2011.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_21009\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21009\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-21009\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vrubsword.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vrubsword.png 452w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vrubsword-285x191.png 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-21009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pavel Vrublevsky&#8217;s former Facebook profile photo.</p></div>\n<p><span id=\"more-65738\"></span></p>\n<h2>ZAXVATMIRA</h2>\n<p>In 2014, KrebsOnSecurity learned from a trusted source close to the Target breach investigation that the user MikeMike on DirectConnection &#8212; the same account that Ika said belonged to Rescator &#8212; used the email address &#8220;<strong>zaxvatmira@gmail.com</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the time, KrebsOnSecurity could not connect that email address to anything or anyone. However, a recent search on zaxvatmira@gmail.com at the breach tracking service <a href=\"https://www.constellaintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Constella Intelligence</a> returns just one result: An account created in November 2010 at the site searchengines[.]ru under the handle  &#8220;<strong>r-fac1</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A search on &#8220;r-fac1&#8221; at cyber intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.intel471.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intel 471</a> revealed that this user&#8217;s introductory post on searchengines[.]ru advertised <strong>musictransferonline[.]com</strong>, an affiliate program that paid people to drive traffic to sites that sold pirated music files for pennies apiece.</p>\n<p>According to leaked ChronoPay emails from 2010, this domain was registered and paid for by ChronoPay. Those missives also show that in August 2010 Vrublevsky authorized a payment of ~$1,200 for a multi-user license of an Intranet service called <strong>MegaPlan</strong>.</p>\n<p>ChronoPay <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/06/organization-chart-reveals-chronopay%E2%80%99s-links-to-shady-internet-projects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used the MegaPlan service</a> to help manage the sprawling projects that Vrublevsky referred to internally as their “black” payment processing operations, including pirated pills, porn, Mp3s, and fake antivirus products. ChronoPay employees used their MegaPlan accounts to track payment disputes, order volumes, and advertising partnerships for these high-risk programs.</p>\n<p>Borrowing a page from the Quentin Tarantino movie <a title=\"IMDB: Reservoir Dogs\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reservoir Dogs</a>, the employees adopted nicknames like “Mr. Kink,” “Mr. Heppner,” and “Ms. Nati.” However, in a classic failure of operational security, many of these employees had their MegaPlan account messages automatically forwarded to their real ChronoPay email accounts.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9761\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CurlyRx.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9761\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9761\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CurlyRx.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CurlyRx.jpg 981w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CurlyRx-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-9761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A screen shot of the org chart from ChronoPay&#8217;s MegaPlan Intranet system.</p></div>\n<p>When ChronoPay&#8217;s internal emails were leaked in 2010, the username and password for its MegaPlan subscription were still working and valid. An internal user directory for that subscription included the personal (non-ChronoPay) email address tied to each employee Megaplan nickname. That directory listing said the email address zaxvatmira@gmail.com was assigned to the head of the <strong>Media/Mp3</strong> division for ChronoPay, pictured at the top left of the organizational chart above as &#8220;<strong>Babushka Vani and Koli.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>[Author&#8217;s note: I initially overlooked the presence of the email address zaxvatmira@gmail.com in my notes because it did not show up in text searches of my saved emails, files or messages.

The Russian business tracking website rusprofile[.]ru reports that Zhabykin is or was the supervisor or owner of three Russian organizations, including one called <strong>JSC Hot Spot</strong>.</p>\n<p>[Author&#8217;s note: The word &#8220;babushka&#8221; means &#8220;grandma&#8221; in Russian, and it could be that this nickname is a nod to the ChronoPay CEO&#8217;s wife, <strong>Vera</strong>. The leaked ChronoPay emails show that Vera Vrublevsky managed a group of hackers working with their media division, and was at least nominally in charge of MP3 projects for ChronoPay. Indeed, in messages exposed by the leaked ChronoPay email cache, Zhabykin stated that he was &#8220;directly subordinate&#8221; to Mrs. Vrublevsky].</p>\n<h2>CYBERCRIME HOTSPOT</h2>\n<p>JSC Hot Spot is interesting because its co-founder is another ChronoPay employee: 37-year-old <strong>Mikhail &#8220;Mike&#8221; Shefel</strong>.

The earliest recorded archive of the Hot Spot website listed three clients on its homepage, including ChronoPay and Freefrog.</p>\n<p>ChronoPay internal emails show that Freefrog was one of its investment projects that facilitated the sale of pirated Mp3 files. Rusprofile[.]ru reports that Freefrog&#8217;s official company name &#8212; <strong>JSC Freefrog</strong> &#8212; is incorporated by a thinly-documented entity based in the Seychelles called <strong>Impex Consulting Ltd.</strong>, and it is unclear who its true owners are.</p>\n<p>However, a search at <a href=\"https://www.domaintools.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DomainTools.com</a> on the phone number listed on the homepage of myhotspot[.]ru (<strong>74957809554</strong>) reveals that number is associated with eight domain names.</p>\n<p>Six of those domains are some variation of FreeFrog.

The Treasury alleged Suex helped to process millions in criminal transactions, including the proceeds of numerous ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t understand how I got mixed up in this,&#8221; Zhabykin <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/us/politics/treasury-department-combating-ransomware-cryptocurrency.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> in 2021. Zhabykin said Suex, which is registered in the Czech Republic, was mostly a failure and had conducted only a half dozen or so transactions since 2019.</p>\n<p>The Russian business tracking service Rusprofile says Zhabykin also is the owner of a company based in the United Kingdom called <strong>RideWithLocal</strong>; the company&#8217;s website says it specializes in arranging excursions for extreme sports, including snowboarding, skiing, surfing and parasailing.

Breen notes that MSHTML also can be found in a number of Microsoft applications, including <strong>Office</strong>, <strong>Outlook</strong>, <strong>Skype</strong> and <strong>Teams</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the worst-case scenario, Microsoft suggests that simply receiving an email would be enough to trigger the vulnerability and give an attacker code execution on the target machine without any user interaction like opening or interacting with the contents,&#8221; Breen said.<span id=\"more-65686\"></span></p>\n<p>Another critical flaw that probably deserves priority patching is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-35641\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-35641</a>, a remote code execution weakness in a built-in Windows feature called the <strong>Internet Connection Sharing</strong> (ICS) service that lets multiple devices share an Internet connection. While CVE-2023-35641 earned a high vulnerability severity score (a CVSS rating of 8.8), the threat from this flaw may be limited somewhat because an attacker would need to be on the same network as the target. Also, while ICS is present in all versions of Windows since Windows 7, it is not on by default (although some applications may turn it on).</p>\n<p><strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, senior staff research engineer at <strong>Tenable</strong>, notes that a number of the non-critical patches released today were identified by Microsoft as “more likely to be exploited.” For example, <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-35636\">CVE-2023-35636</a>, which Microsoft says is an information disclosure vulnerability in Outlook. An attacker could exploit this flaw by convincing a potential victim to open a specially crafted file delivered via email or hosted on a malicious website.</p>\n<p>Narang said what makes this one stand out is that exploitation of this flaw would lead to <a href=\"https://www.netwrix.com/pass_the_hash_attack_explained.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the disclosure of NTLM hashes</a>, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or &#8220;pass the hash&#8221; attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in.</p>\n<p>&#8221;It is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-23397</a>, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook that was exploited in the wild as a zero day and patched in the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/microsoft-patch-tuesday-march-2023-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">March 2023 Patch Tuesday</a> release,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;However, unlike CVE-2023-23397, CVE-2023-35636 is not exploitable via Microsoft’s Preview Pane, which lowers the severity of this flaw.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As usual, the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20December%202023/30480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a good roundup on all of the patches released today and indexed by severity. Windows users, please consider backing up your data and/or imaging your system before applying any updates. And feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience any difficulties as a result of these patches.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/12/microsoft-patch-tuesday-december-2023-edition/feed/","slash:comments":"10"}]}}/*
