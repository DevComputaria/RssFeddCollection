million unmarried men, and some policymakers worry the imbalance will affect stability and development in the countryside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Guangdong province in the south to Shaanxi in the northwest, incentive programmes were due to get underway this month, Chinese news site The Paper reported on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also adds that more will begin in February, writes the <a aria-label=\"South China Morning Post (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3250010/chinese-villages-offer-cash-rewards-matchmakers-anxieties-grow-over-rural-bachelor-crisis?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">South China Morning Post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The village council of Xiangjiazhuang in Shaanxi province announced it would give 1,000 CNY (£110.88) to those who introduce an unmarried man to a woman he eventually <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/marriage-2/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"marries (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marries</a> from January 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The village is home to about 270 households and more than 40 unmarried men between the ages of 25 and 40, according to the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a worrying trend taking over the majority of the country, where it&#8217;s estimated there are about 30 million men without a wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to China’s 2020 census, the country has 722 million men and 690 million women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite China having dropped its one-child policy in 2015, the gender imbalance is most prominent among those born during that 35-year period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the gender ratio in rural areas in 2021 was about 108 men for every 100 women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deeply ingrained preference for parents to have boys over girls and women leaving to work in cities are believed to be the reasons behind this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies Chinese demographics, states financial intensives will not solve the issues at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Simple cash incentives can’t possibly solve the bachelor crisis in rural China,” Yi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The high rate of youth unemployment nowadays also contributes to the low marriage rate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Young men cannot afford to support their families, so of course they cannot afford to get married.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now that China’s local governments are in a debt crisis, it is difficult for the authorities to introduce higher incentives to promote fertility, let alone marriage.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But plans to battle the ongoing dilemma go as far back as October 2021, when a Chinese Communist Party writer proposed a four-pronged solution to &#8220;revitalise&#8221; the countryside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jiang Wenlai, of the party-affiliated news site Red Net, called it &#8220;operation warm the older men&#8217;s beds&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It suggested a blind-date matchmaking service, simplified paperwork for starting families in villages, more high-paying rural job opportunities, and propaganda campaigns promoting &#8220;marriage and childbearing&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately for Jiang, Chinese <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"social media (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social media</a> users promptly ridiculed the &#8220;operation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, China reported a population drop for the second consecutive year, along with a record-low birth rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country&#8217;s mainland population fell by 2.08 million, according to figures released by the NBS earlier this month, dropping from 1.4097 billion down to 1.4118 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One migrant worker in her late 20s from central China told SCMP that the issue lies with young women from rural areas who &#8220;are not interested in getting married.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yang Zi, who works at a hair salon in Guangzhou, said: “I want to live in a rich and developed area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A rural young man can’t offer the lifestyle I want.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a 2021 Communist Youth League survey of 2,905 unmarried urban youths aged 18 to 26, statistics back up Yang&#8217;s claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 43.9 per cent of women said they did not want to get married or were unsure about marriage, while just 24.6 per cent of men responded the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report adds that China&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/generation-z/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Generation Z (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Generation Z</a> has the biggest gender ratio imbalance of any age group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 18.27 million more men than women, it&#8217;s no surprise there are so many left without a female partner to marry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Chinese officials are now sweating over the impact this &#8220;demographic timebomb&#8221; could have on the economy, write <a

met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences has predicted the pension system will run out of money within ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2035, it&#8217;s feared the number

complete the climb without ropes for over a decade and is the only person in the world do have done so.</p>\n<p>In the documentary, directed by Elizabeth Chair Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, we see Alex&#8217;s strained relationship with his girlfriend due to his obsession with climbing.</p>\n<p>There is also a view into how the structure of Alex&#8217;s brain might have affected his ability to experience fear — a possible explanation for why he was able to overcome the seemingly impossible feat of staying calm whilst always one tiny slip from death.</p>\n<p>The film grossed over $10million,

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/net-worths/\">net worth</a> of around $2million (£1.6million).</p>\n<p>Despite his fortune, Alex still lives in a van.</p>\n<p>This is due to its mobility and the obvious efficiency in relation to his climbing career.</p>\n<h2>Is Alex Honnold in Valley Uprising on Netflix?</h2>\n<p>Alex is one of the climbers featured in the 2014 documentary, Valley Uprising.</p>\n<p>Available on <span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/netflix/\">Netflix</a></span>, it goes into the 50-year history of rock climbing in Yosemite Valley — charting the birth and rise of this rebellious counterculture of bin diving and wild parties that clashed with the conservative values of the National Park Service.</p>\n<p>Capturing both the struggle against both the laws of gravity and the laws of the land.</p>\n<h2>Does Alex Honnold feel fear?</h2>\n<p>After a doctor approached him at a book signing, concerned with the functioning of his amygdala (the part of the brain that triggers fear), Alex agreed to an fMRI scan of his brain in 2016.</p>\n<p>The result of the scan was that he does indeed have an amygdala in his brain, but it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;firing&#8221; when he was faced with gruesome images that most wouldn&#8217;t even be able to look at.</p>\n<p>Doctor Jane Joseph who took his scan says: &#8220;It could be the case that he has such a well-honed regulatory system that he can say, ‘OK, I’m feeling all this stuff, my amygdala is going off,’ but his frontal cortex is just so powerful that it can calm him down.”</p>\n<p>\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col sun-col-6\">\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rail

2007[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>But German judge has thrown out the claims that Helge was making false statements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now Helge, who has been dubbed the most important witness against Christian B, is set to once again prove vital in a case against the convicted rapist next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helge first put cops onto Christian B&#8217;s case as the prime suspect in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/\">Madeleine</a>&#8216;s disappearance back in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source close to the Maddie investigation previously told <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22930822/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-master-criminal/\">The Sun that Helge described Christian B&#8217;s boasts</a> about being a &#8220;master criminal&#8221; after allegedly snatching her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claimed that he had stolen a camera and videotapes showing Christian B raping several women &#8211; evidence which helped put him behind bars for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian B &#8211; who is suspected of having kidnapped and murdered Maddie in 2007 &#8211; is now being investigated for other sexual crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the case &#8211; referring to the sexual assault of children &#8211; is an important piece of the puzzle in investigating Christian B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The convicted rapist&#8217;s lawyer claimed that Helge &#8211; dubbed the most important witness in the case against his client &#8211; was lying about the tapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helge originally said he probably left the incriminating video tapes in his caravan in Portugal before he left the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But last year, while being interviewed about Maddie, he said he may have left them at a holiday home he was living in at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian B&#8217;s defence lawyer Dr. Friedrich Fülscher then reported him to prosecutors for making false statements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a judge has since ruled there is no evidence he was lying, meaning Helge is set to testify at the Braunschweig Regional Court in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They argue he never claimed to know specifically where he left the tapes, and was just guessing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors also said a false statement would be of no benefit to him, and that he appears to want to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also thought that Helge first told other witnesses about the disturbing videos in 2006 &#8211; before Maddie was taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June last year, Helge gave his first public comments on Maddie&#8217;s kidnapping in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/news/ausland/news-inland/fall-maddie-der-wichtigste-zeuge-helge-b-spricht-in-bild-84453920.bild.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Bild (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Bild</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22860850/key-madeleine-mccann-witness-moment-christian-b-confessed/\">revealed the moment that Christian B &#8220;confessed&#8221;</a> to snatching the little girl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about his former pal in the two-hour interview, he revealed how his blood ran cold the day the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/\">convicted paedophile</a> told him that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22569004/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-told-pal-didnt-scream/\">&#8220;she didn&#8217;t scream&#8221;</a> shortly after Maddie disappeared from a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3429820/where-madeleine-mccann-vanish-portugal-ocean-club-praia-da-luz/\">holiday apartment in Praia da Luz</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also described the chilling footage he allegedly saw on a video camera he stole from the suspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The petty criminal and burglar said he first met Christian B around the time Maddie vanished from her parents’ holiday home in Praia da Luz in 2007.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also told Bild at the time how the pair discovered a video showing a tied-up woman &#8220;70 or 80 years old&#8221; being abused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the video, he sat down on the bed and pulled down the mask. Then I saw that it was B,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Helge testified to this in court Christian was sentenced to seven years for the rape of a pensioner in 2005 in the Portuguese resort.</p>"},{"title":"I was shown alien bodies held at a secret Nasa base – they had big heads but looked like us, claims Uri Geller","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25544781/aliens-secret-nasa-base-uri-geller/","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 16:16:45 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jessica Baker"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Aliens and UFOs"},{"#cdata-section":"NASA"},{"#cdata-section":"Space and astronomy"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 25544781 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>MAGICIAN Uri Geller claims he was shown &#8220;alien bodies&#8221; which were small and thin with big heads &#8211; but looked uncannily &#8220;like us&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 77-year-old, who claims to have originated spoon-bending, said he was taken to the bodies by a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nasa/\">Nasa</a> engineer and an astronaut.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25545577\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/big-heads-looked-like-us-874996735.png?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25545577\" width=\"960\" height=\"689\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>You Tube</figcredit></figure>Infamous footage of a &#8216;dead alien&#8217; fooled the world for a decade before filmmaker Spyros Melaris admitted to faking it[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25545770\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2013-geller-one-17-people-804639427.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25545770\" width=\"960\" height=\"639\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Famous psychic Uri Geller claims he was shown alien bodies held beneath a Nasa base[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25546121\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 838px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_871bab.png?strip=all&amp;w=828\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25546121\" width=\"828\" height=\"644\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>X/Twitter</figcredit></figure>Uri claims German rocket engineer Wernher von Braun showed him the bodies[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>He claimed the bodies were kept inside a &#8220;massive&#8221; and refrigerated room deep below Nasa&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Centre, which is about 10km northeast of Washington DC, in Greenbelt, Maryland in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uri said German rocket engineer Wernher von Braun and astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, brought him to a concrete building at the base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three flights of stairs below the building, he claims to have seen about eight bodies &#8211; some of which were &#8220;not intact but mangled&#8221; &#8211; in glass containers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Before we went in von Braun asked me to put on an orange, Antarctic-style warm coat &#8211; with the circular blue NASA logo on it &#8211; and he also put one on too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Inside it smelled like a hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I could see what looked like heavy, glass containers, with lifeless bodies lying inside them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was a shocking sight!

the remaining courts of Hell welcome them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bizarre combination of sins are included in the exhibits &#8211; ranging all the way from swearing and wasting food to murder and rape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sixth court says that cheating, swearing or abducting others is paired up with the punishment of being thrown onto a tree of knives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misuse of books, possessing pornographic material, breaking rules and wasting food results in having the body sawn in two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various models depict people being sawn in two, stabbed, bleeding and weeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thieves are thrown into volcanoes, prostitutes are drowned in blood and gamblers are frozen inside ice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time the sinner reaches the tenth court though, they are offered a magical tea which removes any memories about the painful life and moves them onto the Wheel of Reincarnation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creepy park has previously been thought a good place to take young kids so they can be scared into behaving well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays children have to be at least nine to visit the Hell exhibit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the rest of the theme park includes a variety of attractions besides so-called &#8216;Hell&#8217;, the website makes a big show of promoting it&#8217;s creepy centrepiece exhibit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One page reads: &#8220;Good karma for those who are considerate to other hell visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Extra good karma for those who are kind to our hell employees.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath contact information it reads: &#8220;Kindly note that our hell minions will be on a short, well-deserved break this weekend after all their hard work and torture – they will respond to you in 2-3 working days!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_4524\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://passionsandplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sixth-court-hell-explanation-haw-par-villa-singapore-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Looking for free things to do in Singapore, or just something off the beaten path?

<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25496521/death-row-executions-botched-brutal-nitrogen/\">execution</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pawnbroker-killer&#8217;s death required three applications of electricity over a prolonged period, despite his lawyer&#8217;s protests on the grounds of cruel punishment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the first jolt of electricity was administered, sparks and flames are said to have erupted from the electrode attached to Evans&#8217; leg; it burst from the strap holding it in place and caught fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoke and sparks then emerged near Evans&#8217; left temple, but the killer still had a heartbeat, so the electrode was reattached to his leg and another jolt of electricity was applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, doctors found a heartbeat. A third and final jolt of electricity was applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eyewitnesses described the &#8220;stench of burning flesh&#8221; as &#8220;nauseating&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evans&#8217; attorney Russell Canan later recalled: &#8220;His body slammed against the straps holding him in the electric chair and his fist clenched permanently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The electrode apparently burst from the strap holding it in place. A large puff of greyish smoke and sparks poured out from under the hood that covered Mr. Evans&#8217;s face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;An overpowering stench of burnt flesh and clothing began pervading the witness room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;More smoke emanated from his leg and head. Again, the doctors examined Mr. Evans. The doctors reported that his heart was still beating, and that he was still alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At 8:44, the doctors pronounced him dead. The execution of John Evans took fourteen minutes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evans had admitted to a jury that he killed his victim in 1977, claiming he felt the pawnbroker was going to grab a weapon and fire at him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also confessed to a string of other crimes including more than 30 armed robberies, nine kidnappings, and two extortion schemes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors reportedly rejected his guilty plea as they wanted to secure an execution through conviction by a jury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The death penalty was supposedly ordered in light of Evans stating he did not feel remorse and would kill again under the same circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also threatened to escape and kill each member of the jury if they did not sentence him to death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar case of a &#8220;botched&#8221; execution, convicted murderer <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25494034/death-row-kenneth-eugene-smith-alabama-first-nitrogen-execution/\">Kenneth Eugene Smith</a>, 58, was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25513629/alabama-supreme-court-nitrogen-gas-execution-method/\">killed on Thursday by nitrogen gas</a>, also in the state of Alabama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Witnesses claimed he suffered in agony for a total of 22 minutes before the <span id=\"3739ec99-2bd3-49ad-91af-c3ea33ec7704\" class=\"suggested-link\">gas</span> began to flow in a display one journalist described as the &#8220;most violent execution&#8221; he had ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moments before <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23690212/new-death-row-execution-method-alabama-nitrogen-hypoxia/\">inhaling the nitrogen gas</a> through a face mask, similar to that which a firefighter would wear, Smith said: &#8220;Tonight, Alabama causes humanity to take a step backward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Humanity rose up … I am leaving with love, peace, and light &#8230; I love you. Thank you for supporting me.

one eye witness later said.</p>\n<p><strong>Clayton Lockett</strong></p>\n<p>Lockett was sentenced to death for murder and rape in 2000 but his 2014 execution was called off after it was botched.</p>\n<p>Nine failed attempts were made to inject potassium chloride into his veins until officials put the needle into his groin.</p>\n<p>The injection slowed his heart instead of fully stopping it before a doctor placed the needle into an artery, which caused blood to squirt over him.</p>\n<p>The execution was called off but Lockett died of a heart attack on his way to the hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>George Stinney</strong></p>\n<p>The 14-year-old was sentenced to death in 1944 for the murder of two girls, despite a lack of evidence.</p>\n<p>Stinney was too small to fit into the electric chair so he had to sit on books but he survived the first round of 2,400 volts.</p>\n<p>Prison guards had to use two more electric shots to kill the teen.</p>\n<p>Stinney&#8217;s conviction was overturned by a South Carolina court in 2014, 70 years after he was executed.</p>\n<p><strong>John Evans</strong></p>\n<p>Evans had shot and killed an Alabama pawnshop owner in 1977 during a fumbled raid of the store.</p>\n<p>He initially survived the first shocks of 1,900 volts but an electrode came loose resulting in a gruesome scene.</p>\n<p>“A large puff of greyish smoke and sparks poured out from under the hood that covered Mr. Evans’s face,” his lawyer said.</p>\n<p>“An overpowering stench of burnt flesh and clothing began pervading the witness room.”</p>\n<p>Evan&#8217;s heart was still beating after the second electrocution and he finally died following the third shock, in a 14-minute ordeal.</p>\n<p><strong>Pedro Medina</strong></p>\n<p>Medina, a Cuban refugee, was convicted of murdering his neighbor Dorothy James in 1982.</p>\n<p>He died in an electric chair 15 years later but a journalist reported his gruesome ordeal.</p>\n<p>“Blue and orange flames up to a foot long shot from the right side” of his head,&#8221; the reporter said.</p>\n<p>“They’re burning him alive,&#8221; witness Michael Minerva also said.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>Journalist Lee Hedgepeth, who was present on the day, told the BBC of Smith&#8217;s reaction to the gas: &#8220;Kenny begins to violently shake against the straps that are holding him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That violent shaking lasts for about four or five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve witnessed five executions in Alabama, four of them lethal injection, one with nitrogen, and this was the most violent execution I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the first time a new execution method had been used in the US since the lethal injection was introduced in 1982.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith was one of two men convicted of the murder-for-hire killing of Elizabeth Sennett in 1988.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors said he and his accomplice were each paid $1,000 to kill the woman on orders from her pastor husband who was in debt and wanted to collect on her life insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s husband, <span id=\"b4a5eecf-457e-4302-a514-640d6114fb26\" class=\"suggested-link\">Charles</span> Sennett Sr, killed himself when the investigation named him as a suspect, according to court documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith was supposed to be killed by lethal injection in 2022 but the execution was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24692576/death-row-inmate-death-grisly-untested-method/\">called off when prison officials determined they did not have enough time to set a second IV line</a> before the death warrant expired at midnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The killer&#8217;s attorneys claimed he had been strapped to the gurney at 8pm and was not removed until four hours later, stating: &#8220;an IV team entered the execution chamber and began repeatedly jabbing Mr. Smith’s arms and hands with needles, well past the point at which the executioners should have known that it was not reasonably possible to access a vein.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alabama Prisons Commissioner said: &#8220;the people attempting to carry out the execution had tried to insert a line into ‘several locations’ without success.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted of Sennett&#8217;s murder, was executed in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three per cent of US executions are estimated to have been botched between the years 1890 and 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, Austin Sarat, reported that 276 of a total 8,776 executions over the 120-year period went wrong in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Problems with the executions ranged from inmates catching fire while being electrocuted, such as in Evans&#8217; case, to them being strangled during hangings, rather than having their necks broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25542573\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 699px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/a2ecf1e2-e26d-4632-bd5c-fb575728cdc5.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=689\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25542573\" width=\"689\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evans&#8217;

or even several around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#8217;s illegal claim over Taiwan is one such instance that could see sparks fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The communist regime could launch a full-blown invasion to absorb Taiwan into the Chinese mainland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing has already threatened&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25285973/one-misjudgement-war-taiwan-china-escalation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to spark &#8220;uncontrolled escalation&#8221;

with a potential invasion forcing the US to abandon the island or face&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18540321/china-invade-taiwan-new-aircraft-carrier/\">full-scale war with China</a>, which could have devastating consequences including World War Three. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NATIONALISM AND POPULISM </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the ChatGPT, the rise of nationalist or populist leaders promoting aggressive foreign policies might contribute to increased tensions and breakdowns in peaceful communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nationalism contributed to the major alliances in the 20th century that played a role in World War One &#8211; France and Russia felt insecure about the rise of Germany and teamed up, while the Ottoman Empire felt intimidated by Russia and ended up siding with Germany. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the current climate, America &#8211; the world superpower &#8211; feels threatened by the rise of China, fearing it could become the next great power of the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has resulted in hostile relations between the two nations which could, in a worst case scenario, turn into a major war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Russian insecurity around NATO &#8211; a military alliance of very powerful countries around the globe &#8211; could be dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the increasing hostile situation, America and Europe will see themselves as allies working against regimes like North Korea, China and Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues that populist leaders could undermine international institutions and alliances, weakening the mechanisms in place for diplomatic resolutions and cooperation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can result in a lack of effective communication and collaboration, increasing the chances of misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAILED DIPLOMACY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT says repeated failures in diplomatic efforts to resolve international conflicts could erode trust between nations and create a hostile environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin&#8217;s illegal invasion of Ukraine occurred despite the West&#8217;s diplomatic efforts to stop it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> And Israel&#8217;s military response to Hamas&#8217; horrific October 7 attacks escalated even after repeated efforts of international players trying to tackle the situation diplomatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failed diplomacy in more vulnerable situations that involve greater risks could lead to major cross-border conflicts with millions dying across the globe. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TECHNOLOGICAL ARMS RACE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A race for advanced military tech, such as artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons, or advanced weaponry, could lead to another arms race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a country thinks another&#8217;s technological advancements pose a potential threat, it could respond by increasing its own military capabilities, inadvertently escalating tensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nuclear Arms Race in the 20th century between the US and the USSR sparked the Cold War &#8211; and an apocalyptic conflict between the two superpowers almost became a reality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT also believes that fears of falling behind in technology might lead nations to attack each other out of fear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROXY WARS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ongoing regional conflicts where major powers are working as sponsors could escalate into broader wars, pulling more nations into the fray, the AI has warned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ChatGPT, stakeholders could leverage proxy groups and other sponsors to cause major war flashpoints. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, Iran has been fostering terrorism to create conflict in the Middle East through its proxy  groups such as Hezbollah and the Houthis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This forced major world powers such as the UK and the US to join the conflict, increasing fears that the regional situation could turn into an all-out war.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RESOURCE SCARCITY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT suggests that intense competition for essential resources, such as water, oil, or rare minerals, could also be very dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> chatbot, conflicts over natural resources arise when different nations can&#8217;t agree about who they belong to, where they should be sent, how to protect them and how to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/united-nations/\">United Nations</a> Environment Program (UNEP) reports that at least 40 per cent of all intrastate conflicts (conflicts between countries) in the past 60 years have had a link to natural resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the AI believes it could trigger major cross-border conflicts in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ECONOMIC TURMOIL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A severe global <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/uk-recession/\">economic crisis</a> would also create instability and trigger political unrest, potentially leading to conflicts as nations struggle to secure their interests, the AI bot claims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chatbot also argues that the prolonged economic crisis in the era of globalisation could be enough reason for nations to resort to military operations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the World Economic Forum, the next big international economic crisis, such as a global recession, could well spark World War Three. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CYBER WARFARE </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT believes that escalating cyber attacks could lead to widespread distrust and retaliation among nations, escalating into a full-scale war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At times like these when generative AI could be easily leveraged to create widespread propaganda, cyber warfare remains one the biggest threat to world peace. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nations engaged in ongoing conflicts could deploy intense propaganda against the rival state and could severely escalate the situation, which could attract other ally nations and turn into a major global war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes cyber warfare even more dangerous is that such digital attacks don&#8217;t have to be state-sponsored &#8211; and even players not involved in conflicts could leverage propaganda warfare to spark tensions between other countries. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">The &#039;real&#039;

and was nearly caught twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I definitely wouldn’t have survived,” Rachel tells The Sun in her flat in Athens filled with photos of her family, some taken after <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/\">World War Two</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was at an age in which I would have been of no use at the concentration camps. I was around three-and-a-half to four years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Straight to the crematoria. I have no doubt, I wouldn’t have survived.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are telling Rachel&#8217;s story as today marks 79 years after the liberation of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5432787/auschwitz-established-death-camp-holocaust-poland-executed/\">Auschwitz</a>-Birkenau on Holocaust Memorial Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The holocaust cost the lives of six million Jews and millions of other people from different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/greece/\">Greece</a>, a staggering 87 per cent of the Jewish population perished – the second highest percentage after Poland’s 90 per cent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 2,000 of 77,377 Greek Jews returned from the concentration camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel and her family were among the lucky ones who managed to either hide, join the resistance or were part of a small group who were protected from the state during the Nazis’ brutal three-year occupation in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/greece/\">Greece</a> which ended in 1944.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were also the unsung heroes who rallied together despite knowing the fate that awaited them and their families for harbouring Jews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel, her dad, mum, sister, aunt and uncle were saved from certain death by heroic <span id=\"591d291e-6869-4ee0-8868-1ddfd953ac2c\" class=\"suggested-link\">neighbours</span>, friends and acquaintances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel was born on January 8, 1939 – just eight months before World War Two broke out– to Jacob Alcalay and Esther Yomtov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also had a sister called Astro, who was 11 years old by the time she welcomed her baby sister. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel was only two years old when the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nazis/\">Nazis</a> occupied Athens in 1941 &#8211; but she still has memories of the few peaceful years before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We lived at a two-storey house in Attiki Square,&#8221; she told The Sun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were a very close family and we loved each other very much.

They brought us food and my mother somehow managed to cook.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Saved by bravery</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel&#8217;s aunt and her husband had moved to Rea where they were offered shelter by Souzana Stamati, a relative of friends Polymeris, Persephone, Fotini and Vasilis Dramis who hid them earlier at Sepolia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After hearing about Rachel&#8217;s family&#8217;s living arrangements, Souzana sent her sister Pina to pick up little Rachel and bring her to a safer place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She put her life in danger when she came for me because we went through the Germans’ border checks and she told everyone I’m her daughter,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel’s family then followed her to Rea where she remembers her dad <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gardening/\">gardening</a> and being able to go out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We stayed for a while at Rea,&#8221; she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But then suddenly Souzana&#8217;s son came running all the way from Dionysos and told us to leave immediately because a car had arrived carrying Germans who were searching for a Jewish family.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The family nearly became separated when Rachel&#8217;s dad thought about leaving her with a neighbour fearing she wouldn’t be able to keep up on their journey to Kifissia by foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;My father went to a neighbour and asked him, ‘Keep an eye on the house, I’m leaving with my kids because I am being chased by the Germans’. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t<blockquote class=\"article__quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color\">\n\t\t\t<p>I know kids that were the same age as me back then didn’t survive the concentration camps</p>\n\t\t\t\t<cite class=\"article__quote-credit theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"quote-credit\">Rachel Boton</span>\t\t\t\t</cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<!--googleon: all-->\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He said, ‘Don’t take the kid with you, leave her with me’. At that point I started crying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And he said, ‘No, I can’t leave her’. And they took me with them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My father told me [after the war] that if he had left me with the neighbour and he had given me up to the Nazis he wouldn’t bear that and he would have surrendered as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He said, ‘We wouldn’t have left you alone if we knew they got you’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He would have come to surrender. I know kids that were the same age as me back then didn’t survive the concentration camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So we left, we crossed the road that we expected the Germans to drive by and because we were afraid that they would spot us we hid in a valley. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My father and uncle kept an eye on the road waiting for the car to go by so we could have the all clear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think they stopped in Rea and they asked. They found the house empty. When the car left we kept walking.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Betrayal in Kifissia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel&#8217;s dad&#8217;s hindsight and preparation saved his family again as he had already paid a deposit for a place in Kifissia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel and her folks made it to the property &#8211; but they came close to being captured twice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While we were in Kifisia someone betrayed us. I don’t know who,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My father and I left to go to the bakery and get us some food. As we came back we saw two men on the porch with my mother and sister. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I froze, I immediately understood something wasn’t right. I was hopping but then I suddenly stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We made it to the porch and the two men introduced themselves. They were Greeks, collaborators. They told us they were here to arrest us and they would hand us over to the Germans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My father was very calm and handled them very well. They said, ‘We will let you go as long as you give us <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/money/\">money</a> or jewellery’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My father had no money. He ordered my sister to remove a chain and a bracelet she had on her and hand it over to those men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They said, ‘No, we don’t take <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/jewellery/\">jewellery</a> from children’. My father said, ‘We have nothing else to give’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I still don’t know why they spared us, maybe they were good people deep down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But they told us the Germans were coming to arrest us. It seems they already told them. They ordered us to leave immediately.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this day Rachel has no idea why they were spared. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tailed by the Nazis</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But the family found themselves on the move again as Jacob called another friend, Aristidis Marangos, to drive them to Kalyvia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey started with Esther suffering a severe toothache so she made the treacherous journey to visit a dentist in Athens by bus &#8211; hoping her fake identity papers would keep her out of harm’s way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel&#8217;s dad decided to pick her up with Aristidis and the girls on their way to Kalyvia &#8211; but his plan hit another major snag when a Nazi car appeared in the village looking for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had to think quickly and ultimately decided to let the girls leave with Aristidis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he didn’t go until he had his Christian friend promise he would protect them like they were his own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We heard Germans were around looking. My father decided we needed to leave,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The day we decided to move we had God on our side. Suddenly my father noticed a German car that was asking about a Jewish family and he knew they were looking for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My father told Aristidis, ‘Protect my children at all costs’.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Nazis did catch up with Aristidis’ car and stopped them for checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They stopped us while we were in the car, which only had three seats at the front with all the stuff at the back,&#8221; Rachel explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Germans ordered in Greek, ‘Your papers’. He showed his papers. They asked him, ‘What are you doing here?’ He responded, ‘I’m moving with my sisters’. He was young.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My sister was very scared. One of the collaborators who came to arrest us in Kifissia was with the Germans. He didn’t betray us because he knew he would also betray himself. So he stayed silent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My sister placed me in front of her so that they couldn’t look at how pale her face had gotten because of the terror. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aristidis was <span id=\"2c5b5f3b-9d68-4568-aa7e-75bb68743157\" class=\"suggested-link\">next</span> to her. We left, they watched us until the end of the village to make sure we wouldn’t pick someone else up. My father never got in the car.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surviving against all odds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel&#8217;s dad eventually caught up with Aristidis and they drove to Athens to meet her mum before making it to Kalyvia where they stayed until the end of the occupation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel’s family survived against all odds, including her aunt and uncle who managed to remain hidden in Piraeus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Alcalay family didn’t escape the war completely unscathed as they returned to Athens only to find their house was bombed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“One of the bombs hit <span id=\"98e0e360-e617-44b5-966a-888f4c8c90e4\" class=\"suggested-link\">our house</span>, which of course we didn’t know at the time. We never managed to rebuild it,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the occupation, there were several cases of people taking advantage of Jewish families’ despair and only agreed to shelter them for a fee and threw them to the wolves after they ran out of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also those who betrayed them to gain favour from the Nazis. Others even looted their houses shortly after their arrest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But none of Rachel’s protectors considered following that example and their kindness continued after the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her dad&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/business/\">business</a> partner, who shared profits with him during secret meetings while he was hiding, gave him the business back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rachel&#8217;s aunt got her hidden jewellery back with no one trying to steal them during her long absence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel, who also goes by Lily, went on to marry Haim Botton, who also hid during the occupation with his family in Athens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together they had two daughters Matilda, 63, and Aliki, 62, and they have three grandchildren Aris, 33, Filippos, 31, and Lina, 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A life of trauma</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Rachel was too young to fully comprehend the horrors of their situation, her sister&#8217;s constant fear of persecution meant she moved to Israel with her husband in 1953.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Up until the end of her life she remained afraid,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Astro was very scared, she realised the severity of the situation. She lived with trauma. My sister remained in that cycle with other Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She couldn’t escape her past because she interacted with people with similar experiences or worse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel believes the only way she and her family escaped unspeakable horrors was all down to the brave people who helped them during a grave time of need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Of course, they were afraid of getting executed, that is why I want everyone to know what they did. Because they did it while risking their lives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aristidis Marangos, for example, would have been executed if the Nazis didn’t believe his story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Souzana&#8217;s son who ran to Rea all the way from Dionysos to warn us could have been executed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Pina who came to pick me up and went through all the Germans’ checks to take me to Dionysos because I lived in a basement would have been executed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All those people protected us out of the kindness of their heart. The prospect of taking advantage of us never crossed their minds.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25526730\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 403px\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

Prison</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designated as a pre-trial detention centre, the No. 2 Prison appears to be the hole that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/\">China</a> throws its foreign inmates into &#8211; many of which are convicted of spying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, Beijing officials revealed for the first time that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25515959/china-jails-brit-businessman-spying-vanished/\">Brit businessman Ian Stone who vanished six years ago </a>had been secretly jailed for spying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stone, roughly now aged 70, carved out a lucrative career in China for over 40 years, working for huge firms including <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/general-motors/\">General Motors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/pfizer/\">Pfizer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was jailed for five years in 2022 after being held on suspicion of industrial espionage since 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, his daughter Laura revealed he is fighting for his life inside a notoriously grim Chinese prison, which UK officials claim is the capital&#8217;s No.2 Prison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside its walls, he is said to be denied access to adequate medical care and is suffering from life-threatening injuries and severe health conditions after years of neglect and poor nutrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inside hell</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both No.2 and its fearsome twin No. 1 prison &#8211; which hosts death row inmates and those serving life sentences &#8211; have long been associated as places of horror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sites have picked up plenty of allegations of overcrowding, abuse, forced confessions and suspicious deaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their names alone are enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Beijinger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not a lot is truly known about what happens deep inside their eight metre-high, heavily-guarded walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first official reports came in 2003 from jailed Chinese dissident Wang Xiaoning, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for &#8220;incitement to subvert state power&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He served most of his time inside No.2 Prison and barely saw the light of day for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a complaint launched to the World Organisation for Human Rights, he was denied &#8220;any access to recreation or even sunlight for weeks and even months at a time, even though the standard at the prison is to allow prisoners outside once a day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early 2010s, both No. 2 and No. 1 prison underwent a revamp to attempt to scrub up their outward reputations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, foreign media was allowed the tiniest glimpse inside what China was now calling their new &#8220;sunshine detention centres&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cameras had been installed in interrogation rooms to reduce the change of torture, health examinations were made mandatory, a library was opened and inmates were allowed noodles on their birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, more recent testimonies from former detainees have revealed that No. 2 Prison is still a horrific horror show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japanese businessman Hideji Suzuki, now 67, was arrested by China in 2016 on suspicion of espionage &#8211; claims he denied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of interrogation, he was eventually convicted and jailed and sent to No.2 Prison in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once there, Suzuki described being quickly forced to take part in &#8220;education for newcomers&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This torturous training involved inmates being forced to relentlessly sing revolutionary songs about the Communist Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suzuki had to endure five weeks of this &#8220;brainwashing&#8221;, Japanese news outlet, <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20221112/p2a/00m/0in/032000c\">Mainichi</a> reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prisoners were forced to salute propaganda programmes and films on the history of the

&#8216;sunshine jails&#8217; in the early 2010s[/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">High alert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For almost a decade, Beijing has been intensified attempts to crackdown on potential threats to its natural security &#8211; creating ever more sweeping laws to lock up potential spies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, Xi Jinping brought a sweeping counterespionage law into place, which followed with the National Security Law in 2015 &#8211; strengthening the surveillance on foreign nationals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has followed is frequent interrogations and arrests of foreign nationals and a severe clampdown on foreign firms operating in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping to infest a state of paranoia inside the country, China has been encouraging people to join counter-espionage work that includes creating channels to report suspicious activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Espionage paranoia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain and China have traded barbs in recent months over allegations of perceived espionage and its resulting impact on national security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in recent weeks, Beijing has been stepping up warnings over national security and the threat of foreign spies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, China arrested the head of a foreign consultancy firm after claiming they were<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25283769/china-arrests-mi6-spy-recruiting-britain/\">&nbsp;spying for Britain&#8217;s MI6 intelligence service.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing&nbsp;said the suspect –&nbsp;who is neither British nor&nbsp;Chinese&nbsp;– had been stealing state secrets for the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service since at least 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing&#8217;s feared Ministry of State Security revealed the suspect’s surname was Huang, but did not give further details on his identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, they said the foreign national had tried to establish an &#8220;intelligence cooperation relationship&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK has in turn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23893299/uk-must-stand-up-against-chinas-interfere-democracy/\">warned that Chinese spies are increasingly targeting officials</a>&nbsp;&#8211; allegations that Beijing has denied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, claims of a Chinese spy working at the heart of the UK government represented a possible major escalation in Beijing&#8217;s attempts to interfere with British democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A government researcher in September was arrested under the Official Secrets Act, although they subsequently denied spying for Beijing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, the UK also investigated allegations that a Chinese spy disguised as a tourist attempted to<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/23030343/china-spy-allegations/\">&nbsp;infiltrate parliament.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It followed Security Minister Tom Tugendhat blasting China for running &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;&nbsp;and secret&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/22596852/chinas-secret-police-stations-in-the-uk-are-unacceptable/\">police service stations</a>&nbsp;in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last year, China, which has a broad definition of state secrets, has highly publicised several other alleged spying cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, Chinese authorities sentenced 78-year-old American citizen John Shing-wan Leung to life in prison for espionage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China last year also conducted raids on a string of big-name consulting, research and due diligence firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last May, China said it had raided the offices of US consultancy firm Capvision in order to safeguard its &#8220;national security and development interests&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25531161\"

year[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The stealth AUV(Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is still in development but will make its first public appearance on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drone will be used as a platform for a range of missions and will be able to carry mines, torpedoes, or submarine-launched missiles, according to <a href=\"https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/01/exclusive-new-ukrainian-underwater-drone-project-to-dominate-the-black-sea/#prettyPhoto\">submarine expert H I Sutton</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the AUV could also be fitted with a range of sensors to carry out intelligence missions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While its specifications are currently under wraps, Project FURY will partner with an experienced AUV manufacturer in the West to weaponise an already existing platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has seen a lot of success launching Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) putting them one step ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/\">Kremlin&#8217;s</a> Black Sea Fleet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The invisible kamikaze &#8220;Sea Baby&#8221; drone has caused <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23982700/sea-baby-drone-strike-sevastopol-russia-ship-hovercraft/\">extensive damage to several Russian vessels</a> &#8211; most recently <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25219979/first-sight-of-ukraines-new-flame-throwing-invisible-drone/\">spitting fire at enemy boats</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also responsible for an attack on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23507860/drone-sea-baby-blows-crimean-bridge/\">Putin&#8217;s much-beloved £3 million Crimean Bridge</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures from July last year show a gaping hole left in the bridge from the drone blast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Sea Baby&#8221; can carry up to 850kg of explosives and its body is reportedly made from a material invisible to radar systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine also has the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24157377/ukraine-invisible-underwater-kamikaze-drone/\">Marichka underwater kamikaze drone</a> in its arsenal &#8211; capable of carrying 1,000lbs of explosives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The £335,000 Marichka is said to be immune to Russian radio-electronic warfare systems, meaning the pricey weapon is &#8220;invisible to the enemy&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after numerous attacks, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia </a>is getting better at countering USV attacks, and without innovation, Vlad&#8217;s troops could regain superiority, warns H I Sutton. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine&#8217;s Vice Admiral Oleksii Neizhpapa said: &#8220;Some of our tricks and tactics that were worked out in 2022 and 2023 will not work in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Therefore, you need to change tactics, change the technical characteristics of everything you do.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>USVs are vulnerable to aircraft and an underwater unmanned drone could be the answer &#8211; but what sets Project FURY apart is that it&#8217;s not a completely new drone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AUVs are more expensive they are reusable and stealth and have the added advantage of surprise as well as needing no personnel to run. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AUVs will be harder to counter and can carry out missions that are not possible with USVs, warns the sub expert. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine is not the first country to look at developing unmanned underwater drones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, Boeing unveiled its Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle dubbed Orca &#8211; measuring 52ft long and 8ft wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kronos submarine was also developed by a team of Ukrainian engineers at UAE company Highlands Systems to carry out rescue missions &#8211; but it can also carry six Black Scorpion torpedoes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25531458\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

seeing blood red writing on the walls[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Adorned with marble floors, glass chandeliers, and multiple works of art, the four-storey, 35 bedroom palace was meticulously sculpted for 15 years with the Sheikh in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it was completed, in 1985, it was estimated to be worth 500 million AED, or £107 million, which would have been a staggering £317 million today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to legend, on the day the Sheikh moved in he was subjected to furniture flying across the room, faces appearing on the windows and in the walls, and objects unexplainedly going missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He fled immediately, believing that supernatural spirits were roaming its halls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theory stands that &#8220;jinn&#8221;, evil spirits, hate development and so they inhabit abandoned places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The palace&#8217;s paranormal reputation proceeds it and, although it was uninhabited for decades, thrill seekers from across the world travelled to visit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such thrill seeker, Anjaly Thomas, heard tales that occasional screams emanated out of the palace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of disuse, the house featured footsteps in the dust, shattered glass scattered around, broken statues, and overturned furniture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Portraits of menacing maidens seemed to watch Anjaly&#8217;s every move, the furniture became increasingly erratically placed, and then there was the basement &#8211; where the word &#8220;gooooo&#8221; was written in blood red on the walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as thrill seekers, holy men came to the palace vowing to pray away the unwelcome spirits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They removed the eyes of the menacing maidens, men and animals that decorated the walls &#8211; as they thought that it was the depiction of living forms that attracted the jinn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The palace lay unused, disintegrating slowly but surely for decades, until it finally fell into new ownership a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tareq Al Sharhan, the new owner, wants people to see the palace as it was originally intended, a special, artistic, beautiful place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the 1980s, this was something very special,&#8221; he said to local media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I thought I could change its story to something better, something cultural, something for tourists.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of negotiating, and attempting to wrangle a contract, the restoration process took just six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, visitors to the formerly abandoned palace can expect to see the full four flours in all of their initial &#8211; and less haunted &#8211; glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 35 rooms have had expensive paintings and sculptures returned to them, the 40 crystal chandeliers have been restored, Moroccan wall tiles repainted and re-stuck, and antiques from all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Al Sharhan won&#8217;t divulge on how much the palace cost him, he did say the price was worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the palace&#8217;s grand reopening, it has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ras Al Khaimah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plans to renovate it further, which has led to some speculation that the public might be able stay in one of the palace&#8217;s rooms in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a few miles away, <a

Navy’s HMS Diamond is also in the region and has has shot down Houthi missiles and drones with its anti-aircraft machine gun and world-beating Sea Ceptor missiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Del Toro said protecting the free flow of trade was “why we exist as a navy”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as the Iran-sponsored Houthis made an unexpected visit to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a> on Thursday to discuss increasing &#8220;pressure&#8221; on the US and Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebel delegation met with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;cronies soon after they held alleged secret terror talks with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25501788/iran-houthis-terror-meetings-al-qaeda-attacks/\">al-Qaeda to plot intensified attacks against the West.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spokesman Mohammed Abdel Salam said the talks were aimed at getting Russia to increase pressure on the US to &#8220;stop the aggression on the Gaza Strip and deliver humanitarian assistance there rather than militarise the Red Sea&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the rare meeting, Moscow &#8220;strongly condemned&#8221; the joint US and UK strikes against Houthi military bases across Yemen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They blasted the aerial attacks as &#8220;capable of destabilising the situation on a regional scale&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, the Houthis reportedly raised concerns about the Western interventions in the Red Sea and called for closer coordination with Russia to address the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marks yet another dramatic escalation in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25287330/britain-warship-hms-richmond-red-sea/\">crisis</a>&nbsp;that since November has been threatening to ignite an all-out war across the region, which has become a powder keg due to Israel&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">ongoing war with Hamas.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s chilling meeting with the Houthis came soon after Yemeni reports that Houthi leaders allegedly held secret terror meetings with al-Qaeda to plot a wave of &#8220;suicide attacks&#8221; against the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At meetings held in both Yemen&#8217;s capital Sanaa as well as Hodeidah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold, the group reportedly tried to &#8220;persuade&#8221; their Islamist terrorist allies to join their fight in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was part of an apparent bid to convince them to carry out their &#8220;legitimate duty&#8221; to confront western &#8220;aggression&#8221; and stage further attacks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skynewsarabia.com/middle-east/1688231-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1\"

group&#8217;s most dangerous branch &#8211; has been clashing with government forces as its renewed insurgency inside Yemen grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terror group, previously led by Osama Bin Laden and responsible for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/911/\">9/11 attacks</a>, appears to now be taking advantage of the escalating crisis in Yemen and across the Red Sea to launch further attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows months of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25361122/yemen-houthi-red-sea-america-strike/\">indiscriminate maritime assaults</a>&nbsp;by the Houthis, who control most of Yemen, on commercial vessels as well as US and UK navy warships in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebels state their intention is to avenge Israel&#8217;s offensive in Gaza against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/palestine/\">Hamas</a>, but they are targeting ships with little or no link to Israel &#8211; turning one of the world&#8217;s biggest shipping lanes into an active warzone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 12 percent of all global trade normally passes through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the now-under-attack 20 mile-wide stretch of Red Sea also known as the &#8220;Gate of Tears&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a fresh round of Houthi assaults on Wednesday evening, two cargo ships sailing close to the Gulf of Aden came under attack from anti-ship ballistic missiles and the US Navy was forced to intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appeared to be a direct response to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25451904/britain-launches-2nd-blitz-on-houthi-rebels/\">US and UK forces once again targeting Houthi military bases across Yemen</a>&nbsp;in a nighttime blitz on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/raf/\">RAF</a>&nbsp;Typhoon jets unleashed laser-guided bombs to blast eight&nbsp;sites, while US warships, submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets took out other missile storage sites and launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provoked a furious response from the trigger-happy rebels who vowed the attacks &#8220;would not go unpunished&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it came just hours after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rishi-sunak/\">Rishi Sunak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

accepted that China will force him to serve out the remainder of his sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources revealed the British Embassy has been denied access to documents relating to the case and they were barred from the closed-door trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the six-year saga, there had been no official mention of his case from either Chinese or UK authorities &#8211; despite increasing concerns over Stones&#8217; health and welfare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British Foreign Office has been reached for comment, however the UK does not publicly disclose how many of its citizens are detained in China.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin confirmed Mr Stones had been jailed in a curt statement released for the first time yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wenbin said a Beijing court “sentenced the British defendant to five years in prison for the crime of illegally obtaining intelligence for overseas actors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Stones had appealed his conviction, but that the verdict was upheld in September last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-running silence surrounding his case suggests that other foreign business people are&nbsp;likely being secretly held by China while governments and/or their families work privately to secure their release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After living in China since 1978, Stones was fluent in Chinese, had carved out a hugely lucrative career and had plenty of high-flying friends and associates in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After working with huge industry giants in China, Stones set up a Beijing-based investment management consulting firm, Navisino Partners, about 15 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His company was officially deregistered in China as of 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK and US have repeatedly warned their citizens over the risk of detention under China&#8217;s sweeping national security laws and the opaqueness of its legal system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">High alert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>China and Britain have traded barbs in recent months over allegations of perceived espionage and its resulting impact on national security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in recent weeks, Beijing has been stepping up warnings over national security and the threat of foreign spies in an apparent bid to manifest an atmosphere of paranoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, China arrested the head of a foreign consultancy firm after claiming they were<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25283769/china-arrests-mi6-spy-recruiting-britain/\">&nbsp;spying for Britain&#8217;s MI6 intelligence service.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing&nbsp;said the suspect –&nbsp;who is neither British nor&nbsp;Chinese&nbsp;– had been stealing state secrets for the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service since at least 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing&#8217;s feared Ministry of State Security revealed the suspect’s surname was Huang, but did not give further details on his identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, they said the foreign national had tried to establish an &#8220;intelligence cooperation relationship&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK has in turn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23893299/uk-must-stand-up-against-chinas-interfere-democracy/\">warned that Chinese spies are increasingly targeting officials</a>&nbsp;&#8211;

of Kaliningrad yesterday while his cronies hosted the Iranian proxy[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The Houthis, led by spokesman Mohammed Abdel Salam, met with Deputy <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russian</a> Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov to discuss US and UK strikes on the Houthis and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salam said on X/Twitter that it was a bid to get Russia to increase pressure on the US to &#8220;stop the aggression on the Gaza Strip and deliver humanitarian assistance there rather than militarise the Red Sea&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the talks, Moscow &#8220;strongly condemned&#8221; the American and British strikes against Houthi military bases across Yemen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They blasted the aerial attacks as &#8220;capable of destabilising the situation on a regional scale&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, the Houthis reportedly raised concerns about the Western interventions in the Red Sea and called for closer coordination with Russia to address the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And meanwhile, the US confirmed that the destroyer USS Carney had blasted an anti-ship missile fired by the Houthis in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another US ship &#8211; USS Gravely &#8211; also shot down three anti-ship missiles earlier this week which were fired towards a container ship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marks yet another dramatic escalation in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25287330/britain-warship-hms-richmond-red-sea/\">crisis</a>&nbsp;that since November has been threatening to ignite an all-out war across the region, which has become a powder keg due to Israel&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">ongoing war with Hamas.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Houthis form part of Iran&#8217;s self-styled “Axis of Resistance” against Israel, with the explicit aim of destroying the Jewish state at all costs and to prevent any attempts by the West to interfere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moscow&#8217;s decision to host the Houthi delegation could be seen as a provocative move to inflame the West who are battling against the militant group to regain control in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, President Putin taunted the West further by making a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25495893/putin-surprise-europe-ww3-flashpoint-kaliningrad/\">surprise visit into the heart of Europe</a>, flying over the Baltic Sea and skirting four <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato</a> states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dictator, 71, visited&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/world-cup-2018/6526669/kaliningrad-russia-england-belgium-where-world-cup/\">Kaliningrad</a>, a western&nbsp;<a

Russia&#8217;s chilling meeting with the Houthis came soon after Yemeni reports that Houthi leaders allegedly held secret terror meetings with al-Qaeda to plot a wave of &#8220;suicide attacks&#8221; against the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At meetings held in both Yemen&#8217;s capital Sanaa as well as Hodeidah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold, the group reportedly tried to &#8220;persuade&#8221; their Islamist terrorist allies to join their fight in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was part of an apparent bid to convince them to carry out their &#8220;legitimate duty&#8221; to confront western &#8220;aggression&#8221; and stage further attacks,&nbsp;<a

attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows months of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25361122/yemen-houthi-red-sea-america-strike/\">indiscriminate maritime assaults</a>&nbsp;by the Houthis, who control most of Yemen, on commercial vessels as well as US and UK navy warships in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebels state their intention is to avenge Israel&#8217;s offensive in Gaza against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/palestine/\">Hamas</a>, but they are targeting ships with little or no link to Israel &#8211; turning one of the world&#8217;s biggest shipping lanes into an active warzone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 12 percent of all global trade normally passes through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the now-under-attack 20 mile-wide stretch of Red Sea also known as the &#8220;Gate of Tears&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a fresh round of Houthi assaults on Wednesday evening, two cargo ships sailing close to the Gulf of Aden came under attack from anti-ship ballistic missiles and the US Navy was forced to intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appeared to be a direct response to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25451904/britain-launches-2nd-blitz-on-houthi-rebels/\">US and UK forces once again targeting Houthi military bases across Yemen</a>&nbsp;in a nighttime blitz on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/raf/\">RAF</a>&nbsp;Typhoon jets unleashed laser-guided bombs to blast eight&nbsp;sites, while US warships, submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets took out other missile storage sites and launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provoked a furious response from the trigger-happy rebels who vowed the attacks &#8220;would not go unpunished&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it came just hours after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rishi-sunak/\">Rishi Sunak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;warned the Iranian-backed militants they&nbsp;<a

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25333272/rishi-sunak-cabinet-meeting-us-uk-airstrikes-yemen/\">meticulously planned operation</a>&nbsp;earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign Secretary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/david-cameron/\">David Cameron</a>&nbsp;said this week&#8217;s strikes sent the &#8220;clearest possible message&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea. These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exploding tensions have led to discussions for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467277/uks-biggest-warships-spearhead-houthi-strikes-calls-grow-deploy/\">Britain&#8217;s biggest warship to be deployed to the Red Sea&nbsp;</a>to help spearhead strikes on Houthi targets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls are growing for the £3.5billion aircraft carriers, the HMS Queen Elizabeth and its sister HMS&nbsp;Prince&nbsp;of&nbsp;Wales, to enter the crisis and help protect Britain and its allies interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, two US Navy Seals were confirmed as dead after a 10-day search for the pair after they went&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25441147/two-us-navy-seals-vanished-seize-iranian-arms-dead/\">missing during a mission to seize Iranian arms.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last week, Washington reclassified the Houthis as a terrorist organisation as they intensified diplomatic and financial pressure on the militia group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It followed US intelligence claiming that the Houthis were attempting to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25438206/houthi-rebels-iran-weapons-attacks/\">acquire more weapons to intensify their Red Sea attacks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intel revealed the rebels have been carefully curating their plan of attack &#8211; pinpointing when the strikes would be ramped up and how they would gather the necessary weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are concerns the militants will receive even more lethal weapons from Tehran &#8211; their long-term partner, sponsor and backer &#8211; in the weeks to come.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Who are the Houthi rebels?</h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-outskirts-sanaa-yemen-united-874619139.jpg?strip=all&&w=620&&h=413&&crop=1\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" />\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"article__content--intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\tTHE Houthi rebels are terrorising the Red Sea by launching persistent missile and drone attacks on vessels and warships - but who are they?\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>The Shia militant group, which now controls most of Yemen, spent over a decade being largely ignored by the world.</p>\n<p>However, since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war they sprung from relative obscurity to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/9890655/how-red-sea-1trillion-gate-tears-world-trade-halt/\">holding roughly £1trillion of world trade</a>&nbsp;hostage &#8211;

Patrick Sanders stressed that the UK may need to consider conscripting ordinary Brits to bolster its dwindling army[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The shock stats come just days after British General Sir <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467081/brits-conscription-army-chief-ww3-threat/\">Patrick Sanders stressed the need to &#8220;mobilise the nation&#8221;</a> sparking fears that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-3/\">WW3</a> could be on the horizon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the British&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/\">Army</a>&nbsp;being reduced to its smallest size for centuries, Gen Sir Patrick believes there should be a &#8220;shift&#8221; in the mindset of the public who should be willing to defend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/uk/\">UK</a>&nbsp;against foreign adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With mounting fears of a call-up for ordinary Brits, Experts in the Cabinet Office have drawn up a National Risk Register to assess the biggest threats to the UK in the next two years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It calculated that the likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a>, described throughout as an &#8220;adversary state with a large, advanced military&#8221;, attacking a non-Nato ally was higher than 25 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Countries such as <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sweden/\">Sweden</a>, which has now applied to join <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato</a>, have a security pact with the UK meaning Britain would defend their ally if they came under attack from Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal was signed by former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/\">Boris Johnson</a> who said it could mean troops on the ground depending on the &#8220;request from the other part&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk register also warned of a Russian attack on a Nato ally which would trigger the alliance&#8217;s defense clause. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>British troops would support European allies on the ground as the US military would also join forces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials confirmed that to &#8220;contain and deter further aggression, military, diplomatic, and economic capabilities will be needed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts predicted that in a worst-case scenario, the &#8220;hostile state are not ejected and the crisis continues.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only could further Russian attacks spark a draft for UK civilians, but experts also warned that an all-out war would see &#8220;disruption to supply chains&#8221; affecting fuel prices and the economy for &#8220;several years&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK economy has already been hit hard by Vlad&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downing Street was forced to deny any suggestion of a conscription with a spokesman insisting that &#8220;hypothetical scenarios, talking about conflict, are not helpful.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FLYING VISIT </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25495893/putin-surprise-europe-ww3-flashpoint-kaliningrad/\">Putin made a surprise visit to the heart of Europe</a> in a chilling taunt to the West. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dictator, 71, visited <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/world-cup-2018/6526669/kaliningrad-russia-england-belgium-where-world-cup/\">Kaliningrad</a>, a western <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21398558/inside-russia-no-mans-land-lithuania/\">Russian enclave stuffed full of nuclear-capable missiles</a> and wedged between EU countries <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196712/poland/\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/lithuania/\">Lithuania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s most westerly territory of Kaliningrad is used as a headquarters for Russia&#8217;s Baltic fleet and some of its most powerful armaments including hypersonic missiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his visit, Brazen Vlad warned that countries bordering the enclave are not prepared for &#8220;what will follow&#8221; after tearing down Soviet war memorials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;This is stunning ignorance and lack of understanding of where they live, what they are doing and what will follow.&#8221;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25495893/putin-surprise-europe-ww3-flashpoint-kaliningrad/#\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes just days after a Nato chief warned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25415867/russia-ukraine-nato-british-troops-ww3/\">Brits could face conscription</a>&nbsp;as the threat of all-out war with Russia loomed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief of Nato&#8217;s military committee Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer called on the West to &#8220;prepare for an era of war&#8221;, adding that Nato &#8220;needs a warfighting transformation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a crunch summit between Nato defence chiefs in&nbsp;Brussels, Bauer said: &#8220;We need to be readier across the whole spectrum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17900108/what-is-a-conscript-soldier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conscription</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace. And that’s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Russia</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Sir Patrick made his plea to ordinary Britons at the International Armoured Vehicles Conference in Twickenham. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Our friends in Eastern and Northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare &#8211; and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ukraine brutally illustrates that&nbsp;regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our predecessors failed to perceive the implications of the so-called July Crisis in 1914 and stumbled into the most ghastly of wars. We cannot afford to make the same mistake today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of conscription were it to happen, would be the first time in over 60 years that Brits would be required to fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandatory military service was introduced during the First World War after the government passed the Military Service Act in 1916.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25516575\"

reporter was detained</a> by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on March 29, 2023, in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on trumped up charges of espionage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a>&#8216;s spy service alleged that the reporter, acting on the instructions of the American side, collected secret information about the

launched appeals to secure his freedom &#8211; all have so far been rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is the first Western reporter to be jailed on espionage charges in Russia since the Soviet era, and he faces a prison term of up to 20 years if convicted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his end-of-year news conference in December, Putin said that <a

told The Sun: &#8220;My whole life, I thought, and I wanted to have a twin sister. Thank God I got her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So I wondered my whole life thinking &#8216;it must be awesome if I had a twin sister.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started when a friend of Ano&#8217;s came across a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/\">TikTok</a> video of a woman bearing a striking resemblance to Ano and sent it to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ano said: &#8220;My friend found that video of her getting piercing, and sent it to me, she was like, &#8216;It&#8217;s you&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And I said: &#8216;it&#8217;s not me, but it&#8217;s me. So I was searching for that person,  and I couldn&#8217;t find her.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 21-year-old was eventually able to track down Amy and the first thing she texted her was &#8220;How long I have been searching for you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two of them met at the Rustaveli station in Tbilisi &#8211; neither of them suspected they were related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recalling the moment they met Ano said:&#8221; We just met because we look like each other.

you can see the beetle cheekily hidden away in a super quick time then you could be the world&#8217;s greatest bug catcher. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amazing artwork shows a forest scene packed with leaves, flowers and sticks but there&#8217;s also a tiny little beetle somewhere in the picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Packed onto a beautiful green background, surrounded by pretty wildlife and colourful <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plants/\">plants</a>, you would never think there&#8217;s a beetle in there somewhere at first glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The image was created by cottage rental agency Sykes Holiday Cottages after they ran a recent survey of 2,000 adults about vacationing and wildlife in the UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fascinating results of the survey found that the Cosnard&#8217;s net-winged beetle was the hardest species of bug to find in the wild so they created the brainteaser to test people&#8217;s sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So despite the scene looking pretty normal at first glance, once you find out there&#8217;s a very sneaky bug crawling around somewhere in the forest your eyes start to open up as the hunt begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for a brainteaser that seems so easy the insect is nowhere to be seen and has left many baffled, calling the puzzle impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beetle cheekily blends in with the things around it and it&#8217;s hardly noticeable to those without the watchful eyes of a bug fanatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can solve this challenging <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/optical-illusion/\">optical illusion</a>, you could make a brilliant beetle hunter with your eye for the creepy crawlies and clever problem-solving brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At an initial glance there is no chance a bug is crawling around alone among the leaves without anyone noticing it but the deeper you search the quicker it appears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bug is hidden deep within the photo and has been expertly placed meaning you’re bound to run out of time and never have the success of finding it all to yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown, people who regularly challenge themselves with optical illusions and puzzles see big improvements in their problem-solving skills, concentration and attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychologists at The University of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/glasgow/\">Glasgow&nbsp;</a>found that staring at an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/optical-illusion/\">optical illusion</a>&nbsp;can improve eye sight by allowing you to see small print.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And according to <a href=\"https://www.zenbusiness.com/blog/could-training-your-brain-optical-illusions-key-business-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ZenBuisness:</a> &#8220;These visual puzzles can give you a good mental workout that can, in turn, help you think more efficiently and solve problems more easily.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this particular piece, people with a high visual IQ should be able to spot it within seconds and leave themselves enough time to enjoy the rest of the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still can’t find the beetle here&#8217;s a big clue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beetles love hanging out on sticks as they blend in as they&#8217;re both brown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sky News Arabia</a> reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terror talks came after Yemeni government officials accused the militia group of carrying out recent assassinations in the city of Aden alongside members of al-Qaeda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over two years, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula &#8211; which the US classes as the terror group&#8217;s most dangerous branch  &#8211; has been clashing with government forces as its renewed insurgency inside Yemen grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terror group, previously led by Osama Bin Laden and responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/911/\">9/11 attacks</a>, appears to now be taking advantage of the escalating crisis in Yemen and across the Red Sea to launch further attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows months of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25361122/yemen-houthi-red-sea-america-strike/\">indiscriminate maritime assaults</a> by the Houthis, who control most of Yemen, on commercial vessels as well as US and UK navy warships in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebels state their intention is to avenge Israel&#8217;s offensive in Gaza against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/palestine/\">Hamas</a>, but they are targeting ships with little or no link to Israel &#8211; turning one of the world&#8217;s biggest shipping lanes into an active warzone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 12 percent of all global trade normally passes through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, the now-under-attack 20 mile-wide stretch of Red Sea also known as the &#8220;Gate of Tears&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a fresh round of Houthi assaults on Wednesday evening, two cargo ships sailing close to the Gulf of Aden came under attack from anti-ship ballistic missiles and the US Navy was forced to intervene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appeared to be a direct response to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25451904/britain-launches-2nd-blitz-on-houthi-rebels/\">US and UK forces once again targeting Houthi military bases across Yemen</a> in a nighttime blitz on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/raf/\">RAF</a>&nbsp;Typhoon jets unleashed laser-guided bombs to blast eight&nbsp;sites, while US warships, submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets took out missile storage sites and launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provoked a furious response from the trigger-happy rebels who vowed the attacks &#8220;would not go unpunished&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came just hours after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rishi-sunak/\">Rishi Sunak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;warned the Iranian-backed militants they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/25451458/sunak-and-biden-warn-more-strikes/\">would strike Yemen again</a>&nbsp;&#8220;if needed&#8221; after a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25333272/rishi-sunak-cabinet-meeting-us-uk-airstrikes-yemen/\">meticulously planned operation</a>&nbsp;earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign Secretary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/david-cameron/\">David Cameron</a>&nbsp;said the strikes sent the &#8220;clearest possible message&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea. These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It marked another dramatic escalation in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25287330/britain-warship-hms-richmond-red-sea/\">crisis</a>&nbsp;that since November has been threatening to ignite an all-out war across the region, which has become a powder keg due to Israel&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">ongoing war with Hamas.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exploding tensions have led to discussions for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467277/uks-biggest-warships-spearhead-houthi-strikes-calls-grow-deploy/\">Britain&#8217;s biggest warship to be deployed to the Red Sea </a>to help spearhead strikes on Houthi targets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls are growing for the £3.5billion aircraft carriers, the HMS Queen Elizabeth and its sister HMS&nbsp;Prince&nbsp;of&nbsp;Wales, to enter the crisis and help protect Britain and its allies interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, two US Navy Seals were confirmed as dead after a 10-day search for the pair after they went <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25441147/two-us-navy-seals-vanished-seize-iranian-arms-dead/\">missing during a mission to seize Iranian arms.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Washington reclassified the Houthis as a terrorist organisation as they ramped up diplomatic and financial pressure on the militia group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It followed US intelligence claiming that the Houthis were attempting to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25438206/houthi-rebels-iran-weapons-attacks/\">acquire more weapons to intensify their Red Sea attacks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intel revealed the rebels have been carefully curating their plan of attack &#8211; pinpointing when the strikes would be ramped up and how they would gather the necessary weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are concerns the militants will receive even more lethal weapons from Tehran &#8211; their long-term partner and backer &#8211; in the weeks to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"

been launching relentless drone and missile attacks on any ships &#8211; including warships &#8211; they deem to be connected with Israel in solidarity with their ally Hamas.</p>\n<p>The sea assaults have threatened to ignite a full-blown war in the Middle East as ripples from Israel&#8217;s war in Gaza are felt across the region &#8211; with Iran suspected of stoking the chaos.</p>\n<p>However,

golden steaks attracted rich and famous visitors to his chain of restaurants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/25348145/mikel-arteta-salt-bae-steak-fork-arsenal/\">Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was spotted at the Chef&#8217;s Dubai restaurant </a>while enjoying his winter break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors of Nurset Gökçe diners have been <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25456777/salt-bae-slammed-diner-bill-including-gold-steak/\">left with eye-watering bills</a> with £360 steaks and £56,000 worth of wine being added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chef sparked fury after he posted a picture of the bill on his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/\">Instagram</a>, where he is followed by 54 million people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the blatant brag brought a flood of protest from local and social media &#8211; especially from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/\">Turkey</a>, his home country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many felt it was an insult to ordinary hard-working Turks who are struggling to cope with more than 60 percent inflation and a 10 percent unemployment rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2022, his popularity took a bashing after he was seen <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20843624/fifa-forced-humiliating-admission-salt-bae-world-cup-pitch/\">harassing Argentinian football players </a>after their World Cup win against France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It raised questions about how he had access to the pitch and how he was able to hold the World Cup trophy while getting close to an unimpressed Lionel Messi. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure

Kaliningrad[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>His unexpected and rare trip comes amid a spate of Western warnings over the threat of full-scale war with Russia in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s most westerly territory of Kaliningrad is used as a headquarters for Russia&#8217;s Baltic fleet and some of its most powerful armaments including hyper-sonic missiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, three Il-96 aircraft of the special flight detachment Rossiya flew from Moscow and out over the Gulf of Finland between <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato</a> states<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/finland/\"> Finland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/estonia/\">Estonia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s so-called <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17983090/inside-vladimir-putin-jet-toilet-russians-fight-food/\">&#8220;Flying Kremlin&#8221;</a> presidential plane then hugged&nbsp;the coasts of ex-Soviet states Latvia and Lithuania before landing in Kaliningrad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On high alert, a Nato military A330-243MRTT reconnaissance&nbsp;plane from Netherlands Air Force was seen circling over the Baltic Sea off the eastern coast of Swedish island Gotland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An RAF&nbsp;Boeing RC-135W electronic reconnaissance aircraft also allegedly approached the Kaliningrad region,&nbsp;according to Russian reports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Beech 350 King Air ALSR reconnaissance aircraft of the French Air Force reportedly also monitored Putin&#8217;s&nbsp;arrival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over accusations of child abduction of children taken from war-torn Ukraine to Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He now restricts his foreign travel, and would face arrest if he visited Western and other ICC countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russia had requested a security corridor while flying over neutral waters close to Nato territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They always take a special security measure wherever the head of state [Putin] is concerned,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And, of course, they were engaged in the [security] measure this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I mean, everything that should be done to ensure the security of the head of state is being done.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peskov denied the dictator’s visit to Kaliningrad was aimed at riling up the West, even though it has been interpreted as such in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is not a message to Nato countries when the president visits the regions of the Russian Federation,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is not a message to NATO countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead Putin&#8217;s mouthpiece claimed the high-stakes trip was aimed at &#8220;economic development&#8221; in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is the main task, not to send messages.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25362787/putin-plan-west-ww3-leaked-2025/\">leaked German military report</a> from last week suggested Putin would likely move troops and more missiles into the &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/baltic-sea/\">Baltic sea</a>&nbsp;enclave to inflame tensions with the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bombshell files suggested that such a move would be part of a longer-term plan to invade and conquer the Suwalki Gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 60-mile Polish-Lithuanian corridor that connects between Belarus and Kaliningrad has been dubbed Nato&#8217;s &#8220;weakest link&#8221; as is feared to be a future battleground for a Russia-Nato war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the West, it is the only land link to the three&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22617158/russian-attack-ukraine-dam-khakovka-zaporizhzhia-ww2/\">ex-Soviet Baltic republics</a>&nbsp;&#8211; Lithuania,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/latvia/\">Latvia&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/estonia/\">Estonia&nbsp;</a>&#8211; which would be left vulnerable to Putin if the west lost control of the gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Russia, control of the corridor would give Moscow a land link to Kaliningrad from Belarus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin&#8217;s provocative trip comes amid a flurry of warnings have come lately from military chiefs and policymakers over the threat of full-scale war with Russia in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downing Street was forced to rule out conscription after the head of the British army General Sir Patrick Sanders <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467081/brits-conscription-army-chief-ww3-threat/\">warned that civilians would need to fight Russia in a future war.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stressed the need for ministers to &#8220;mobilise the nation&#8221; amid the threat of World War 3 after accusing the existing military of being &#8220;too small&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Our friends in Eastern and Northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already&nbsp;acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare &#8211; and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ukraine brutally illustrates that&nbsp;regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato&nbsp;</a>military chief warned Brits to prepare for an all-out war with Russia and be ready to join the battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer said that the globe is facing its&nbsp;&#8220;most dangerous and volatile moment&#8221; in history and that &#8220;large numbers of private citizens will need to be mobilised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a crunch summit between Nato defence chiefs in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brussels/\">Brussels</a>, Bauer said: &#8220;We need to be readier across the whole spectrum&#8230;We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And that’s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with&nbsp;Russia,&#8221; he announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same day Russia&#8217;s warmongering foreign minister&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25402467/putin-lavrov-new-world-order-ww3-speech/\">Sergei Lavrov vowed a &#8216;New World Order&#8217; was emerging</a>&nbsp;and promised the West that their time of &#8220;global domination&#8221; is over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UK defence secretary <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/grant-shapps/\">Grant Shapps</a>&nbsp; warned that the UK was “moving from a post-war to a pre-war world” with the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25372068/grant-shapps-grow-army-ww3-threat/\">threat of a major

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14236643/josef-fritzl-elisabeth-girl-in-the-basement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was sentenced to life in prison in 2009</a> after he held captive his daughter Elisabeth in a bunker at his home in Amstetten for 24 years and fathered seven children with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 88- year-old, told a <span id=\"b7c63f09-b6c1-4c69-b0fb-d7c4e1cc14a2\" class=\"suggested-link\">court</span> in in Krems an der Donau today that he deeply regretted his actions, and that he had dealt with the crimes “intensely”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The verdict means he can now launch another application within a year for his release to a nursing home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His lawyer Dr Astrid Wagner said the monster was ordered to continue regular therapy sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also refuted previous reports that he was seen drinking coffee and revealed the first he would do when he&#8217;s freed is to get a beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told The Sun: “There was a report that he was out having a coffee but this is not true  &#8211; because the first thing he would do when he is released is have an Austrian beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He wants to get on with the process — and he is very confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He says it’s in God’s hands but also in my hands.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">REMORSE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked how Fritzl had expressed regret for his crimes, Dr Wagner told The Sun: “He told me he would give his life to undo what he did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“But I said it would change nothing, and the past could not be undone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He is reading the case and the files. He thinks about what happened a lot. There is a lot of remorse.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She went on: “Today’s hearing was a very important first step on the road to his release to a nursing home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“In Austria you can apply for parole after 15 years and he has been in for 16.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> “It’s probably a bit too early to apply for release to a nursing home right now. But this time next year it is more likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“Even if he is released then it will be like a prison because of his age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> “For a nearly 90-year-old man he is in good physical condition — the same as he was 16 years ago — but he cannot go on hikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But his dementia means he thinks people have invited him to parties, so he has these problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After spending 15 years behind bars for his horrific crimes, his lawyer insists he is &#8220;100 per cent rehabilitated&#8221; and &#8220;he would never do it again.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;He&#8217;s another person now, these 16 years changed him, he&#8217;s a very humble person now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He also promised me not to commit suicide. There was something in his mind some years ago he was very depressed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “We have a new psychiatric report that says he is not a danger to anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He struggles a bit with the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dementia/\">dementia</a>, but only a little.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t<blockquote class=\"article__quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color\">\n\t\t\t<p>He would never do it again</p>\n\t\t\t\t<cite class=\"article__quote-credit theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"quote-credit-meta\">Dr Astrid Wagner</span>\t\t\t\t</cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<!--googleon: all-->\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>Fritzl left at Landesgericht District <span id=\"f014e61c-1450-493d-9aff-d8396f2f5680\" class=\"suggested-link\">Court</span>  in the police van using the same rear entrance at around 8.45, after a short 15-minute hearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reporters and members of the public were not allowed into the courtroom as the hearing was held behind closed doors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beast used his hand to cover his face for the half-a-mile journey back to Stein Prison, where he is expected to spend his first night in a general cell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is said to have struggled to hear judges deliver their verdict, which will see Fritzl moved from the high-security wing of Stein <span id=\"42b23969-63a0-4018-a154-0cee285283fc\" class=\"suggested-link\">prison</span> to a traditional wing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court heard he had regularly read the case files on his 2009 prosecution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hearing was held in a courtroom instead of a <span id=\"750bdce5-d564-4ebf-9e29-cd474b30d74c\" class=\"suggested-link\">prison</span> office, where early release applications are generally heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Court chief Ferdinand Schuster told The Sun: “This case was heard in the court as it is of great interest to the media and the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The defendant said he was intending to file another application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s impossible to predict the <span id=\"41c32c94-e537-465f-92bd-44d9dad41614\" class=\"suggested-link\">future</span> but maybe within a year another application can be made.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DAUGHTER&#8217;S ORDEAL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, Fritzl was handed a life order for incest, rape, coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and for the negligent homicide of one of his infant sons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisabeth was 18 when she disappeared in 1984 and did not re-emerge until 2008 from the dungeon-like basement built by her father under the family home in Amstetten, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/austria/\">Austria</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abuse resulted in the birth of seven children &#8211;

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hauled Aditya off the easyJet plane in handcuffs</a>&nbsp;after it landed on the island and he spent two nights in police custody before going in front of a judge in Mahon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aditya sent the message in a group he shared with six friends alongside a photo of him in sunglasses and a hat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a aria-label=\"Spanish (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spanish</a> response was a reaction to an alert put out by the British authorities after they picked up on Aditya’s message while he was still at Gatwick airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian-born Aditya, who was 18 at the time, had flown to the island on July 3, 2022, for a post <a aria-label=\"A-Level (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/a-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A-Level</a> exam holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He ended up being charged with a public order offence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanish prosecutors said on Monday <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25391573/brit-faces-six-figure-payout-taliban-text-spain/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"they wanted him to pay €94,782 (£81,251) for the cost of scrambling a Eurofighter military jet (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">they wanted him to pay €94,782 (£81,251) for the cost of scrambling a Eurofighter military jet</a> and a fine of €22,500 (£19,288) if he was found guilty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But judge Jose Manuel Fernandez-Prieto said today his actions hadn’t constituted a crime after returning his verdict just three days after the end of the quick trial at the centralised Audiencia Nacional court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said of the actions of the British youngster: “No intention to provoke the mobilisation of a military plane, or any police or other emergency service is apparent.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “It cannot be ignored that the message and photograph with it were not sent to any official organisation, nor were they publicised in any way that would inevitably lead to the corresponding mobilisation of the pertinent police, assistance or rescue services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the contrary they were shared in a strictly private environment, between the accused and the friends he was flying with to which only they had access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The accused could not even remotely assume (as he expressly stated at the trial), that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by the British services, nor by third parties outside of his friends who received the message.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British security services are thought to have picked up the message via Gatwick Airport’s public WiFi service, although there was no confirmation at the trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aditya admitted one of his friends could have been using the airport WiFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pal who gave evidence on his behalf denied a prosecutor’s suggestion one of them could have shared the ‘Taliban bomb joke’ with others outside of their Snapchat group and it might have been picked up that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of his arrest, Aditya had just finished at St Olave’s Grammar School in Orpington, <a aria-label=\"Kent (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kent</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has recently outlined plans to work in the finance sector and is now studying economics at <a aria-label=\"Bath (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/bath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bath</a> University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aditya has also represented <a aria-label=\"England (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/england/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">England</a> at several international chess tournaments and once met legendary player Gary Kasparov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said at his trial the friends in his Snapchat group were people he had known for up to ten years and trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told the court: “I was called a Taliban at school because of my features and I used to joke about it and I know the Taliban is considered to be a terrorist group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But I didn’t think it was going to cause people on the flight to be afraid because it was sent to a private friends’ group and wasn’t meant for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what he thought upon seeing the two fighter jets flanking his flight, Aditya said: “Just before that time the Ukraine-Russia war was happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought it was a military exercise related to that conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The pilot said the jets had been sent because he had accidentally sent a distress signal in a communication error and it was being fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Me and my friends were held when we landed and put in a room for a couple of hours and after that I was told I was being arrested and taken to a police station.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State prosecutor Pedro Rubira revealed in his closing speech at the end of the 90-minute trial that the investigation prompted by the defendant’s ‘hoax’ concluded he was not a “dangerous terrorist activist.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he claimed Aditya was guilty of an act of “simulation” which had become public and created danger and would have led to people panicking if he had voiced the words he used on a public street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an emotionally-charged closing speech, Aditya&#8217;s defence lawyer Margarita Quintana said his comments in a “private group” had become public without any judicial authorisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then slammed the British authorities for “breaching his right to privacy&#8221;, saying if anyone should be held responsible for the cost of the Spanish response it should be them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Aditya didn’t put his message on Facebook or advertise it,&#8221; Quintana added. &#8220;What he did was the equivalent of making a joke inside a car with friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Who has the authority to intervene in a joke! If we’re prevented as individuals from enjoying freedom of expression and right to privacy what have we got left!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is not a punishable act.

people <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/\">when the blast tore through the place</a>, killing him instantly and injuring 30 others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The military blogger had been mysteriously presented with a lethal gold-coloured figurine by Trepova at the event only moments earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a> has accused Ukraine&#8217;s secret services of orchestrating the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">assassination</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage captured Trepova strolling past the cafe while clutching a large cardboard box shortly before the explosion, believed to be filled with a TNT bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorities named Trepova as the culprit and arrested her less than 24 hours after the blast, charging her with terrorism and other offences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors say she knowingly gave Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, a device that had been rigged with explosives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she has denied knowing that she was carrying a bomb and instead said she believed it was a listening device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also said she was acting under orders from her handler in Ukraine and was motivated by her opposition to Russia&#8217;s military offensive on Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told the courtroom yesterday: &#8220;I thought there was a wiretap in the figurine, not a bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My conscience is clear. I was basically sent to my death with a bomb [by Ukrainian handlers].&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am very pained and ashamed that my naivety and gullibility led to such catastrophic consequences,” she told victims and their relatives in court, adding that she had been set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The art student, from St Petersburg, is said to have previously been detained for taking part in anti-war rallies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her lawyer Daniil Berman said today that the sentence was “illegal and unfounded&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is probably the most cruel sentence against a woman in Russia in the entire history of modern justice.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tatarsky was an influential military blogger, one of the most prominent among a group of hardline correspondents that have gained huge followings since Russia launched its offensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a> posthumously bestowed a top award, the Order of Courage, on Tatarsky, citing his &#8220;courage and bravery shown during professional duty&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors had asked the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/court-2/\">court</a> earlier this week to find Trepova guilty and sentence her to 28 years in a general-security <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prison/\">prison</a> colony with a fine of 800,000 rubles (£7,000).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, she was sentenced to 27 years &#8211; three years off the maximum sentence for committing acts of terrorism, trafficking explosives and forging documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jailed alleged assassin&#8217;s friend, Dmitry Kasintsev, who harboured her in his flat after the bombing was sentenced to one year and nine months for concealing a serious crime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trepova&#8217;s boyfriend Dmitry Rylov &#8211; also in his 20s and a member of the so-called Russian Liberation <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/\">Army</a> &#8211; has declared she was &#8220;set up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is also wanted by the secret services and has been detained at anti-war protests with his girlfriend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rylov insisted Trepova must have &#8220;completely misunderstood the purpose&#8221;&nbsp;of the statue given to Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;I believe that my wife was set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am in full confidence that she would never be able to do something like that on her own volition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, with Daria we really do not support the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">war in Ukraine</a>, but we believe that such actions are unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am 100 percent sure that she would never have agreed to such a thing if she had known.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a>&nbsp;released a supposed confession video showing the blonde, with cropped&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hair/\">hair</a>, admitting her role in the bomb plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked to explain why she is being detained, Trepova says: &#8220;I&#8217;d put it this way, for being at the assassination side of Vladlen Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I brought there the statuette that exploded.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was then pressed to reveal who supplied her with the devastating explosive, to which she replied: &#8220;Can I tell you later?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moscow has accused Ukraine of staging several attacks and assassinations inside Russia, sometimes also blaming Kyiv&#8217;s Western allies or the domestic opposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They included the car bomb that killed Dugina and another blast that targeted pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin and killed his assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyiv denied involvement in those but has appeared to revel in the spate of assassinations and attacks on high-profile backers of Moscow&#8217;s offensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said last year that the assassination of Tatarsky was the result of infighting in Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497238.jpg?strip=all\" alt=\"Suspect Daria Trepova, 26, was filmed moments after passing the box with a bomb to  Tatarsky\" class=\"alignnone\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trepova, 26, was filmed moments after passing the box with a hidden bomb inside to Tatarsky</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497164.jpg?strip=all\" alt=\"She was seen carrying the bust inside the cafe\" class=\"alignnone\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trepova was seen carrying the mysterious bust outside the cafe &#8211;

but we couldn&#8217;t rush to help because the fire was so strong,&#8221; one woman told local media at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than half of the studio&#8217;s 70-strong workforce was killed in the attack and 30 others were injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The act of pouring an enormous amount of gasoline and setting it ablaze is extremely likely to be fatal, and immolating people is truly cruel and inhumane,&#8221; Chief Judge Keisuke Masuda ruled today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victims &#8220;were engulfed in fire and smoke in the blink of an eye&#8230; They died an anguishing death as the studio instantly turned into a hell,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Masuda sentenced Aoba to what critics call a painful death by long-drop hanging after finding him guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aoba&#8217;s lawyers had attempted to seek a lighter sentence on the grounds of &#8220;mental incompetence&#8221;, however judges ruled that the arsonist knew what he was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors had longed demanded the death penalty for Aoba and said his crime was motivated by a desire for revenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aoba believed that the studio &#8211; known by its fans as KyoAni &#8211; stole his ideas, prosecutors said, a claim the company has denied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The delusion that KyoAni Studio had plagiarised his work influenced his motivation,&#8221; prosecutors told the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they added that such &#8220;delusions&#8221; did not cloud his ability to carry out the attack with full understanding of his actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his guilty plea in September, 2023, Aoba had admitted he did not think so many people would be killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I felt I had no other option but to do what I did,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;I feel tremendously sorry and the feeling includes a sense of guilt.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aoba, who was arrested near the scene, suffered burns to over 90 per cent of his body and only regained consciousness weeks after the fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was only able to be arrested after 10 months in hospital during which he underwent 12 operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan is one of the few developed countries <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2525739/death-penalty-countries-execution/\">where capital punishment still exists.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is overwhelming public support for the practice &#8211; a 2019 government survey found that 80 per cent of Japanese people saw the death penalty as &#8220;unavoidable&#8221; and only nine per cent voted to abolish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of 2023, 107 people were on death row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanging has been Japan&#8217;s sole execution method for around a century-and-a-half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it has been heavily criticised for the &#8220;cruel&#8221; and &#8220;secretive&#8221; ways it is carried out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics argue that Japan leaves death row inmates on tenterhooks in solitary confinement for years before they are given little or no warning at all and executed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, families have only been notified about the execution after it has taken place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No executions were carried out in Japan in 2023 but there was one in 2022 and three in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convicts In Japan are led to the gallows blindfolded, with their feet bound and hands cuffed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trapdoor opens below them when several <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prison/\">prison</a> officers each press a button simultaneously in an adjacent room. None is told which button triggers the deadly mechanism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have argued that long-drop hanging is prone to botched executions and makes for a long, agonising death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aoba was sentenced to death today in a courtroom packed with family members of the victims. One person was heard crying and covering their eyes as the judge spoke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of KyoAni fans braved snow to stand outside the courthouse, with one of them Renji Kiriyama, 27, recalling hearing about the fire on his car radio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With all the news reports about this case, I hope this will expose more people to KyoAni. If this spreads the name of KyoAni and brings its works to more people and more people know its name, I would be happy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I hope the verdict would ease the burden and anguish of the families even a little,&#8221; said Kentaro Hatanaka, another fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I hope KyoAni will again bring to the world kinds of animations that are filled with life as they did before this happened,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1981 by a husband and wife, KyoAni is a beloved institution for anime fans, responsible for popular TV series including &#8220;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&#8221; and &#8220;K-ON!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the attack, there was shock and grief in Japan and worldwide, with Apple CEO Tim Cook among those tweeting his support and a crowdfunding campaign raising £1.8million to help the firm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hideaki Hatta, company president,  welcomed the verdict today but said that the &#8220;thought of all our employees who perished&#8230; just breaks my heart&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25495564\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2019-arson-attack-animation-studio-874415603.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25495564\" width=\"960\" height=\"608\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Judge Keisuke Masuda (pictured top centre) handed down the death sentence today[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25495740\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dec979d6-1881-45ba-850b-5d09b8b9534f.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25495740\" width=\"960\" height=\"632\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The judge ruled that Aoba was not suffering a &#8216;mental disorder&#8217;

just like we were in the First World War and Second World War. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And I personally don&#8217;t think the mobilisation will look very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Everybody will be eligible to be called up &#8211;

It will be whoever is required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It would be very similar to the First World War and Second World War because it will be what&#8217;s required. It will be a total war &#8211; the country will be completely mobilised to fight off the Russians. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is still a lot of water to flow under that bridge before we get there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after General Sir Patrick Sanders, Chief of the General Staff, said Brits <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467081/brits-conscription-army-chief-ww3-threat/\">could face a call-up</a> if the UK goes to war with <span id=\"d3c8b306-55af-4c9f-8cdc-cce036c86eb2\" class=\"suggested-link\">Russia</span> because the &#8220;military is too small&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he stressed the need for ministers to &#8220;mobilise the nation&#8221; in a speech amid the&nbsp;looming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25390060/which-countries-could-be-involved-world-war-3/\">threat of World War Three.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of conscription, were it to happen, would be the first time in over 60 years that Brits would be required to fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandatory military service was introduced during the First World War after the government passed the Military Service Act in 1916.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the British <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/\">Army</a> being reduced to its smallest size for centuries, Gen Sir Patrick believes there should be a &#8220;shift&#8221; in the mindset of the public who should be willing to defend the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/uk/\">UK</a> against foreign adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although mobilisation of the nation would look similar to previous wars, Mr de Bretton-Gordon said different skills would be needed for modern warfare. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t<blockquote class=\"article__quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color\">\n\t\t\t<p>We have the modern-day Hitler heading West and we need to do something about it</p>\n\t\t\t\t<cite class=\"article__quote-credit theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"quote-credit\">Hamish de Bretton-Gordon</span>\t\t\t\t</cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<!--googleon: all-->\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>For example, young people with a wealth of knowledge about <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/drones/\">drones</a> will be highly sought after. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Those 17-year-old kids who might not have been called up but happen to be particularly good at flying drones could find themselves being called up,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Whoever makes drones in <span id=\"4a3ceb45-6d96-47d7-bed2-72c6ce431e70\" class=\"suggested-link\">this country</span>, we should be protecting them and making sure they are churning them out like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tech will be big &#8211; cyber is already massive.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more needs to be done to build a &#8220;robust&#8221; younger generation who can head to the <span id=\"e7d25e01-09e2-4c40-b167-c7a5d3b4a27a\" class=\"suggested-link\">battlefield</span>, Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the increasing threat of Britain being dragged into a war should be a &#8220;wake-up call&#8221; to the country &#8211; and its leaders, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Soldiering is hard work.

He said: &#8220;Like most Ukrainians, Vova has dignity, self-respect, and a pride in who he his&#8230;.[he] was always going to stand and fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vova was always going to defend his home, his family, and his people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;Vova is a loving, dedicated, hard-working Ukrainian who loves his Ukrainian family, including the entire Ukrainian family for whom he is President.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm friends first met in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york/\">New York</a> in 2008 while working on the comedy film ”Love in the Big City” and their time together led to a steadfast friendship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They continued to work together on movies until Zelensky became president in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the battle-hardened <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21487246/ukraine-zelensky-churchill-hero-putin/\">&#8220;war hero&#8221; Zelensky</a> of today to &#8220;very young&#8221; man on his set in 2008, he said: &#8220;There was always something extra about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He had a life, a vitality, an energy that filled the room.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dodson continued: &#8220;In many ways, that much younger man from 2008 seems very much the same as he is now, in other ways, very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Today, Vova looks physically stronger, more sturdy, which seems appropriate for a man with the burden he must now carry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Describing the former actor and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24795616/joke-kids-help-war-humour-zelensky/\">dad-of-two&#8217;s work ethic</a>, Dodson revealed that Zelensky was &#8220;never the kind of person to make grand speeches or pronouncements.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, &#8220;his most important language has always been action. If something urgent needed to be done then he committed himself completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Action is Zelensky’s language.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as the Ukrainian leader faces constant missile barrages raining down on cities, a cash-strapped military, chronic ammunition shortages and trembling Western support &#8211; Dodson said he will rise to the challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He has always been able to combine the dream with what it takes to make that dream come true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, if as a director there was something I wanted to do, something that was perhaps a little crazy or potentially expensive, Vova would move heaven and Earth to help it to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As the Ukrainian President, I see the same qualities in Vova. He empowers the people around him to do their very best.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dodson said the now 46-year-old has always been a man of integrity and kindness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the pair worked on their last film together before Zelensky became president (“Me You He She&#8221;), Dodson recalled his friend entertaining his five-year-old niece for hours with games and magic tricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was a beautiful, perfect example of Vova&#8217;s humanity. He loves people. When you [are] around him, you never feel overwhelmed with his ego, because it simply is not&nbsp;there,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dodson said: &#8220;From the very beginning of Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression, barbarism, and conquest, Vova has reacted exactly as I would have expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Endless numbers of villains try to portray Vova as something he is not in order to discredit Ukraine and destroy support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But the simple fact is that what you see of Vova publicly is who he is. That is his genuine self. He authentically, passionately cares about people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And while I can also see the exhaustion in his eyes, I also see the same ferocious commitment that I saw many, many times on set — a person determined to get it right no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now, with the destiny of a nation and the lives of people at stake, I see the same commitment in Vova’s eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How could Vova be anything other than what he is?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as the defiant leader has promised he will do everything he can to secure an international <a

Wednesday near the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border, killing all 74 people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has not confirmed there were Ukrainian POWs onboard and has promised to respond to Moscow&#8217;s charge once the evidence has properly been looked at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, OSINT sources, military officials and analysts have pointed to striking inconsistencies in the Russian claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a Ukrainian kamikaze drone attack <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25487862/ukrainian-kamikaze-drone-putin-palace-oil/\">struck deep behind enemy lines and destroyed a Russian oil depot</a> achingly close to one of Vlad&#8217;s precious palaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The midnight strike on Tuapse on the Black Sea was the <a

other major cities killing 18 and wounding more than a hundred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Zelensky had vowed a forceful response for the deadly &#8220;terror attacks&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He declared: &#8220;Let them know in Russia that the Ukrainian character knows how to be far-reaching enough in response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Russian war will inevitably be brought back home, back to where this evil came from, where it must be quelled.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25491739\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

medal with the Order of the Gold Star by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/\">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> last year, but his deeds have only just been revealed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The planes he destroyed had been used to wreak havoc on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine </a>under<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\"> Vladimir Putin</a>’s orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Babiy was killed on his mission to protect his comrades from Russian fire, it has now been revealed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As part of a reconnaissance group, Oleh Babiy travelled on foot more than 600 km [375 miles] through enemy territory to carry out a special combat mission &#8211; to stop terrorist aerial bombings of peaceful Ukrainian cities by Russians,” said his citation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Having penetrated deep behind enemy lines, the scouts completed their task &#8211; they destroyed a Russian <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18869108/russia-nuclear-war-plane-ukraine/\">TU-22M3</a> bomber and disabled two more, but they themselves suffered irreparable losses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Returning to Ukrainian-controlled territory, the reconnaissance group of Colonel Oleh Babiy was ambushed and entered into an unequal battle with the Russian invaders”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While “covering the departure of his fellow soldiers”, he was “mortally wounded and died.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For his heroic feat, Oleh Babiy was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star, posthumously.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine did not disclose the location of the attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in August last year a TU-22M3 bomber was destroyed by a kamikaze drone, and there were claims that others were damaged at the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23563714/putin-nuke-bombers-destroyed-drone/\">Soltsy </a>airfield in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23556386/explosion-kamikaze-drone-russian-air-base-ukraine-supersonic/\">Novgorod </a>region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time the incident was reported to have been undertaken from inside Russia, as a helicopter-style drone was used which could not have flown from Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That an Ukrainian <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/spying-and-espionage/\">spy </a>team was behind it has only just been revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the first time such a plane had been completely destroyed by Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hit was a huge embarrassment for Putin and indicated a lack of security and air defences at bases he uses for strikes on Ukraine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was one of “nine successful reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines” completed by Babiy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also penetrated occupied regions of Ukraine a dozen times “to organise and support the resistance movement in the temporarily occupied territories and behind enemy lines”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He identified some 70 targets such as enemy command posts, military equipment, and engineering and fortification equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks to the successful completion of tasks by Colonel Babiy’s group, it was possible to disrupt the logistics of the invaders, destroy important facilities and elements of critical infrastructure,” his citation said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Entire units of the Russian occupation forces lost their combat effectiveness, the system of command and control of troops and weapons, suffered a disruption in communication, and then suffered losses in efficiency in interaction with their rear.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hero colonel was survived by his wife and two children, including a daughter aged one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revelations have come just after claims that Ukraine killed 65 of their own prisoners of war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25476050/bombshell-clues-russia-lies-ukraine-plane-crash/\">several clues indicate that Russia might be lying</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, an Ukrainian kamikaze drone has hit a major oil depot neighbouring one of Putin&#8217;s palaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25487862/ukrainian-kamikaze-drone-putin-palace-oil/\">Enormous flames engulfed the sky near the Rosneft oil facility</a> RN-Marine Terminal Tuapse in Krasnodar region, on the main coastal road to Sochi, where Putin&#8217;s £1bn palace lies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the

aria-label=\"the war (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the war</a>, as Ukraine uses its own kamikaze drones to strike inside Russia while it waits for new arms supplies from the West.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rosneft oil depot was attacked by drones of the Security Service of Ukraine, sources in special services told <a aria-label=\"Ukrainska Pravda (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/01/25/7438815/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ukrainska Pravda</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The source said the attack caused a conflagration at the plant, where &#8220;the primary processing unit for petroleum products, specifically the vacuum and atmospheric chambers, took damage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The special service sourced added: &#8220;There will be many more surprises; the systematic work is ongoing&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage showed one drone as it buzzed towards the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Air defences were heard in Tuapse before the explosion at the oil refinery owned by Rosneft, Russia’s second largest state-controlled company and biggest oil producer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire spread to more than 2,150 square feet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The refinery contained 100 tons of petrol and 200 tons of oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirty eight employees were evacuated and no casualties reported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after, footage of a second Russian factory up in flames emerged &#8211; albeit some 3,066 miles away from Tuapse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, an airboat production workshop of the Alligator LLC company was burnt to the ground in the village of Elovoe, Emelyanovsky district, near Krasnoyarsk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple videos show giant flames engulfing the factory, although the cause of the fire is currently unknown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came the day after Russia accused Ukraine of downing an Il-76 military transport plane over Belgorod region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Moscow (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moscow</a> claimed the aircraft had 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board, as well as six crew and three security guards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has demanded an international investigation of the incident, and questioned whether its PoWs were on board a plane seen as supplying weapons close to the war zone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of relatives and with the emotions of our society,” said Ukrainian leader <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Volodymyr Zelensky (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“All clear facts must be established, as much as possible, given that the plane crashed on Russian territory &#8211; beyond our control…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The GUR [Ukrainian military intelligence] is investigating the fate of all prisoners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The security service [SBU] is investigating all the circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And I instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to inform partners about the available data in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our state will insist on an international investigation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 18, Ukrainian drones hit the Petersburg Oil Terminal on the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/baltic-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Baltic (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer

hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 21, in Leningrad region, Ukrainian drones struck the Kremlin-linked Novatek liquefied natural gas company terminal in Ust Luga port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Moscow Times reported: “The new targets include facilities that play a key role in supplying and supporting Russian military forces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The destruction of such objects is intended to put pressure on the enemy and change the course of military operations in favour of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Over the course of several months, the Ukrainian military has successfully adapted foreign artillery shells into kamikaze drones.”</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3

We saw that in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/\">Second World War</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Part of that is needing extra people &#8211; and they would have to introduce conscription if there was a war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something everyone should do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Lord West also cautioned: &#8220;We are a long way from that at the moment.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of conscription, were it to happen, would be the first time in over 60 years that Brits would be required to fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandatory military service was introduced during the First World War after the government passed the Military Service Act in 1916.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after General Sir Patrick Sanders, Chief of the General Staff, said Brits <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25467081/brits-conscription-army-chief-ww3-threat/\">could face a call-up</a> if the UK goes to war with Russia because the &#8220;military is too small&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he stressed the need for ministers to &#8220;mobilise the nation&#8221; in a speech amid the&nbsp;looming <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25390060/which-countries-could-be-involved-world-war-3/\">threat of World War Three.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the British&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/\">Army</a>&nbsp;being reduced to its smallest size for centuries, Gen Sir Patrick believes there should be a &#8220;shift&#8221; in the mindset of the public who should be willing to defend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/uk/\">UK</a>&nbsp;against foreign adversaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lord West said slashing spending to the Armed Forces has been &#8220;very damaging&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The message Gen Sir Patrick is trying to get across is that the army is too small and if there was a fight, we need more soldiers,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been too little spent on the defence of our nation and I think the army is too small. I thought the Navy was too small with too few ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think there are probably too few soldiers. Our defence has been squeezed for so many years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Going back to 2010, the <span id=\"83edeff0-1304-4d22-a0ad-2023028bae8e\" class=\"suggested-link\">review</span> reduced spending to a third. I don&#8217;t think most people in <span id=\"c830b382-1594-4f64-af57-01a0daaf49c0\" class=\"suggested-link\">this country</span> realise that had been done. That&#8217;s been very damaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our Armed Forces have been starved of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/money/\">money</a> &#8211; we have started giving them a lot more now, but not enough. And that means the Armed Forces are not at the level they should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Getting the message across that the military are not being giving sufficient funds is legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the general public should be worried. The country should be nervous about the fact the military has been squeezed so much.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;People like <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a> and the Iranians look at Britain and Europe and think, &#8216;they talk about fighting, but they spend nothing on their military&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Putin has bumped his spending up to 40 per cent. It&#8217;s unbelievable. And that is worrying.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lord West said Britain would &#8220;need a lot more soldiers to fight the Russians&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But the worry is the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russians</a> would rapidly start losing against Nato and then their trick would be to use a nuclear weapon,&#8221; he warned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And when you use one nuclear weapon, it&#8217;s starts escalating and before you know it, you are in a nuclear <span id=\"80df21f0-c2dc-4fb8-9768-ae88cb67e7b1\" class=\"suggested-link\">holocaust</span>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, a leaked military report revealed what could be Putin&#8217;s step-by-step <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25362787/putin-plan-west-ww3-leaked-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plan to bring the West to the brink of World War 3</a>&nbsp;&#8211; and it starts in weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret docs detail the despot&#8217;s possible &#8220;path to conflict&#8221; which reaches its climax in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/summer/\">summer</a>&nbsp;of 2025 on &#8220;Day X&#8221; when half a million Nato and Russian soldiers will face each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s understood Gen Sir Patrick would not support conscription, but believes the British people should change their mindset to &#8220;think more like troops&#8221; and be prepared for a call-up if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato</a>&nbsp;goes to war with&nbsp;Putin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes just days after a Nato chief warned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25415867/russia-ukraine-nato-british-troops-ww3/\">Brits could face conscription</a>&nbsp;as the threat of all-out war with Russia loomed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief of&nbsp;Nato&#8217;s military committee Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer called on the West to &#8220;prepare for an era of war&#8221;, adding that Nato &#8220;needs a warfighting transformation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a crunch summit between Nato defence chiefs in&nbsp;Brussels, Bauer said: &#8220;We need to be readier across the whole <span id=\"aca8bfc5-8573-4be5-88d3-7222952cc0bc\" class=\"suggested-link\">spectrum</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17900108/what-is-a-conscript-soldier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conscription</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace. And that’s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Russia</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Sir Patrick made his plea to ordinary Britons at the International Armoured Vehicles Conference in Twickenham on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Our friends in Eastern and Northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already&nbsp;acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare &#8211; and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> brutally illustrates that&nbsp;regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our predecessors failed to perceive the implications of the so-called July Crisis in 1914 and stumbled into the most ghastly of wars. We cannot afford to make the same mistake today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Sir Patrick, who will stand down as Chief of the General Staff in six months, previously used a speech to warn that the UK was facing its “1937 moment” over the war in <span id=\"affd9497-853d-4759-809e-3c4466634dee\" class=\"suggested-link\">Ukraine</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claimed Britain must be ready to “fight and win” to ward off the threat from Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sombre message comes as the Middle East has become a powder keg unsettled by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">Israel&#8217;s ongoing war</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a>, Iran-backed&nbsp;<a

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25389552/china-response-iranian-strike-pakistan/\">clashes and strikes between Iran and Pakistan.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nato recently&nbsp;<a

drills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among that number will be 20,000 British troops as the alliance plans to test allies on their ability to engage in conflict with an adversary as capable as&nbsp;Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steadfast Defender will begin this week and run to late May, involving units from all 31 NATO member countries plus candidate-member Sweden. </p>\n\n\n\n<a

report that he was out having a coffee but this is not true — because the first thing he would do when he is released is have an Austrian beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He wants to get on with the process — and he is very confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He says it’s in God’s hands but also my hands.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Wagner added: “He expects the hearing today to have a positive outcome, but not that he can go home today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A new application must be submitted for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This will happen soon because I am convinced that he dealt very intensively with his actions &#8211; like completing therapy and so forth &#8211; and he also regrets them very much.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his trial in 2009, Fritzl pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence

class=\"wp-block-heading\">DAUGHTER&#8217;S NIGHTMARE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fritzl kept his daughter Elisabeth captive in a newly-built cellar complex, for 24 years, since 1984.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evil dad drugged and abused his daughter, raped her more than 3,000 times and fathered seven children with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heartless monster did not hesitate to toss the bodies of the children who died at birth into a furnace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of the children were raised in the basement by their mum while another three were brought up by sick Fritzl and his wife Rosemarie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fritzl had convinced his wife their daughter had run away to join a sect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a cruel twist, he forced Elisabeth to write letters to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14322230/josef-fritzl-wife-rosemarie-elisabeth/\">Rosemarie</a>, claiming she was unable to care for the kids, asking her to raise them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was only when Elisabeth&#8217;s eldest daughter, Kerstin, fell critically ill that her ordeal came to an end in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a rare act of mercy, Fritzl allowed Elisabeth to take the 19-year-old to the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She managed to speak to police revealing the horrors she had suffered throughout the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first words were &#8220;No one will believe me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisabeth’s recorded 11-hour testimony led to Fritzl&#8217;s sentencing to life imprisonment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisabeth and her children live now under adopted names after going through years of therapy, while Rosemarie, now 84, is believed to be living in a small flat in Linz &#8211; around 30 miles from the former Fritzl home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Fritzl&#8217;s physical and mental <span id=\"fac88ec5-92ee-4ccc-807d-2b06aeb5acdd\" class=\"suggested-link\">health</span> has deteriorated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an exclusive interview with The Sun through his lawyer last year, Fritzl claimed he would see his family again one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said he wanted to live to 130 and he was confident he would be able to do so&nbsp;if he drinks enough water.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Josef Fritzl&#039;s

door in his cellar in 1984.</p>\n<p>She agreed and moments later she is drugged with an ether-soaked towel, tied up and chained to a bed.</p>\n<p>She would spend the next 24 years locked up in the hellish prison in Amstetten.</p>\n<p>Evil Fritzl went on to rape her over 3,000 times in rat-infested bunker.</p>\n<p>He would beat and kick her and force her into degrading acts &#8211; including re-enacting scenes from violent porn films.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth gave birth to seven babies in the cellar with no medical care.</p>\n<p>Kerstin, born 1988, Stefan (1990) and Felix (2002) were left to live with their mum in the underground hellhole.</p>\n<p>But Lisa, (born 1992) Monica (1994) and Alexander (1996) &#8211; were raised upstairs, by Fritzl and his wife Rosemarie after he convinced her they were left on the doorstep by Elisabeth.</p>\n<p>Alexander&#8217;s twin Michael died shortly after birth with cruel Fritzl tossing his body in an incinerator.</p>\n<p>The family&#8217;s nightmare sees Fritzl threatening them if they dare to escape and punishing them by switching off the electricity.</p>\n<p>Their nightmare comes to an end when Kerstin fell critically ill in 2008.</p>\n<p>Fritzl allowed Elisabeth to take her to the hospital where she revealed the shocking horrors she had suffered.</p>\n<p>Despite trying to argue he was trying to be a protective father, Fritzl <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14236643/josef-fritzl-elisabeth-girl-in-the-basement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was sentenced to life in prison in

10 Yuan (£1.11), the cost of entering the not-so-magical park is roughly one per cent of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/disney/\">Disney</a> World&#8217;s hefty cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the unarguable value for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/money/\">money</a>, what lies behind the rusty old entrance gates certainly isn&#8217;t on the level of Disney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures online show a murky green pool of water sitting around the Cinderella Castle as the park&#8217;s main attraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a tall Ferris Wheel just behind the eerily similar Disney Castle, the tall red turrets sit dirty and in desperate need of a clean, according to the pictures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the park sits slowly decaying statues, from a Popeye needing more spinach to a rocket ship with it&#8217;s paint job peeling off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oddly coloured cyan castle inside is littered with purposely placed artwork from a cowboy hat and guns to a mummified man still wrapped in bandages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Adventure castle is followed up by a wildlife exhibit filled with plastic animals and painted on safari walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With kangaroos, zebras and toadstools all <span id=\"35ab8755-a050-4060-bcc6-7023103fa5f4\" class=\"suggested-link\">next</span> to each other the exhibit shows the best of the entire animal kingdom across the world living just feet apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/models/\">Models</a> of people standing on rocks wearing cowboy outfits and checked shirts complete the first part of the Shijingshan experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First opened on September 28, 1986, the theme park is owned and operated by the&nbsp;Shijingshan District&nbsp;government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2021, the park underwent a major upgrade and three new roller coasters were designed &#8211; taking the total to 16 although only six are open all year round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s the park&#8217;s confusing obsession with guns, nudity and bizarre themed rides that have left many calling it &#8220;freaky&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A giant pineapple sits on top of a narrow green roller coaster track in one of the world&#8217;s weirder rides as a giant goblin dressed in spiky armour stares at you while the Warrior Turnplate ride throws you around the air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a huge great white shark hung up by its back fin with a rope around its neck for the whole family to enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans of the iconic Jurassic Park, Shijingshan tried its hand at a similar exhibit with mixed results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sign posts are losing letters and the scary T-Rex overseeing the park has blunt <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/teeth/\">teeth</a>, thin human-like fingers for claws and off-putting eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bright colours from purples, blues, pinks and greens flood the theme park but, instead of being enticing pastel shades to draw you in, they sit dirty and clouded with dust giving it a slight brown tinge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real attraction is the cartoon bunny pointing a gun at guests, a suspiciously similar mermaid to Ariel with clams over her bare chest and a cracked penguin with the word &#8220;party&#8221; painted on its front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A baby elephant that looks less like Dumbo the more you stare at it and a pool with a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/pink/\">pink</a> flamingo raft in it sit in a dark corner of the park as Mickey, Minnie and Daffy all watch on from the painted walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to top it all off, a four-fingered hand can be seen dangling a decapitated head over a wall and a creepy nativity-style scene has been set up featuring ghouls and fiends drenched in luminescent green splashes of paint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shijingshan went all-in on its faux Disneyland appearance and even advertised itself by saying: “Disney is too far to go, please come to Shijingshan&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The park&#8217;s current slogan is “Happy, Healthy and High” but this was changed after Disney allegedly sued the owners for the previous title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A visitor to the park left a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/review/\">review</a> online saying: &#8220;The worst park I have been to! This felt like being in an abandoned amusement park. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Almost freaky! It felt like two sections to this park, the part we entered first was absolutely abandoned and all rides were closed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another said: &#8220;We actually quite enjoyed walking around the park because it was so strange. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The place is so unloved despite being really busy but there are actually some really good rides.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third wrote: &#8220;I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s okay, just don&#8217;t put your hope to high that it&#8217;d be something like Disneyland.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, the park does still have an average rating of four stars on <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d735579-r211303768-Beijing_Shijingshan_Amusement_Park-Beijing.html\">Tripadvisor</a> and is almost always busy in the <a

the family have no way of knowing if he had medical <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/insurance/\">insurance</a> or how to access it and now face fees of up to £64,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie, a retired teacher, said when she heard the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/news/\">news</a> on the 3rd of January she &#8220;felt sick&#8221; and her legs &#8220;went weak.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially the family had limited detail and relied on information given to them through the Foreign Office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Julie knew was her son was alive but seriously injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said while waiting to hear more: &#8220;I took all <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/\">Christmas</a> decorations down in the middle of the night because I didn’t know what to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worried mother later found out her son was “in a coma unconscious, unable to make any movement and with a serious head injury.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also had knee fractures, multiple rib fractures, facial trauma and a dislocated hip and will likely be requiring further surgery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie said upon hearing the news she “felt sick” and her “legs went weak.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie was also told Adrian had already had one operation as his &#8220;bone was protruding from his leg.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told the nurse to &#8220;do whatever it takes&#8221; to save him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie had feared the injuries were so severe that when she first saw a photo of Adrian she felt &#8220;relieved that he was recognisable as (her) son.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she didn&#8217;t realise didn&#8217;t realise that Adrian had been in a coma since the day of the accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I assumed he was in an induced coma and that they would be able to wake him up,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When i got to the bottom of it he has been in a coma since the accident so they don’t actually know when he&#8217;s going to wake up,&#8221; she added.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although Julie&#8217;s &#8220;first instinct is to jump on a plane and help wake him&#8221;, she is currently battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma and needs to complete her treatment before she can go.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It&#8217;s just very, very difficult. I feel emotionally torn,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie finds some respite being able to talk to Adrian through <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a> voice notes and calls as said she feels &#8220;less remote.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I say ‘if you can hear me open you eyes, everyone is thinking about you were all praying for you, keep trying&#8217;,&#8221; she told The Sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Julie now has more information she is still somewhat in the dark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don&#8217;t know when he&#8217;s going to wake up I don&#8217;t know what place he&#8217;s going to be in when he wakes up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;He&#8217;s probably going to have to learn to walk again, I just have to take one step at a time and do what I can do today,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adrian was taking a break in between <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/jobs/\">jobs</a> working on superyachts when the “nightmare” occurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He worked as a first mate and sometimes a captain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie said: “He has friends everywhere all the travelling he did, he liked travelling, liked meeting people, very thoughtful, very caring.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is hoping Adrian will be stable to fly home in the coming month and expects he will arrive on a stretcher accompanied by two medics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The medical repatriation man doesn&#8217;t think it will be safe to fly him before four weeks because of the brain injury,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Adrian might be home soon he faces a long road to recovery and its thought the cost of his treatment will start at £65,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the family have spent nearly £12,000 on medical <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/bills/\">bills</a> and have started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-us-bring-adrian-home\">fundraiser to cover the remaining costs.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie has been &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; with the support and has raised £37,545 of the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She urged other families to check if they have travel insurance and also to let someone know how to access it should the worst happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25480147\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 730px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> has promised to reply to the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a> charge that it killed its own people on board the Russian plane &#8211; but only after it has examined all the evidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But OSINT sources and analysts have pointed to striking inconsistencies in the Russian claims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25466779/63-dead-russian-military-plane-crashes/\">Footage at the site of the crash</a> in Belgorod region does not so far show multiple bodies &#8211; or parts &#8211; at the scene. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bloody remains of one body may be visible on a blurred image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Ukraine advisor Anton Gerashchenko shared the clips, announcing there has been no official information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ukrainian Defense Ministry cannot confirm at the moment whether the aircraft has been shot down by Ukrainian Defense Forces &#8211; information is being clarified,&#8221; he wrote on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/\">X</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Footage from the site of the crash shows that the plane is completely destroyed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russians say the human remains are up to over a mile from the site &#8211; but they have not been shown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the Emergencies Ministry staff &#8211; who would normally deal with air crashes &#8211; have been banished from the site and replaced with Defence Ministry soldiers with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/\">police</a> support, according to reports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were especially keen to get hold of documents seen scattered in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/snow/\">snow</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, the Russians said there were 65 PoWs, six crew and three security guards aboard the plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veterans of other exchanges like Ukrainian POW Max Kolesnikov said that three guards is not plausible and suggests it is a “lie”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his case, there were at least 20 guards on the plane carrying 50 prisoners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, a list of names of those supposedly on the plane was given by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a>’s leading woman propagandist Margarita Simonyan, head of the RT state media empire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures of some of the 65 she named are shown.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet at least one of those on the list was handed back to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> on January 3, say Ukrainian reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other accounts say up to 18 were swapped earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are no longer in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also confusion over the plane’s routing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Il-75 was reported &#8211; for example by Russian <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/13727929/telegram-who-owns-safe-privacy-whatsapp/\">Telegram</a> channel VChK-OGPU, with links to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/law/\">law</a> enforcement &#8211; to have crashed soon after taking off from Belgorod airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet this airport has been mainly closed since early in the war, as it is too near to the Ukrainian border.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Russian accounts say the plane was heading from Moscow to Belgorod when it crashed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian telegram source Skrynka Pandory claims the plane’s tail number was RA-78830.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was spotted over <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/armenia/\">Armenia</a> on January 23, 2024 and flew towards <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iran/\">Iran</a>, where it disappeared, said the channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this account,  it flew over <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/egypt/\">Egypt</a> after having overflown <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/saudi-arabia/\">Saudi Arabia</a>, along with the Red Sea and Iran. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It disappeared from the radar near <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/syria/\">Syria</a>, and then flew to Belgorod, it is claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its previous flight was under the number RFF8319 on January 24, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its direction from Belgorod was towards central <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is true, it is unlikely to have been carrying prisoners of war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, there are claims that the plane has been regularly used through the war to ferry arms from Iran.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everything points to the fact that it brought weapons from the East,” said the channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it does seem this aircraft has been used before to transfer PoWs, as in the case of Azov fighters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More suspicions come from the speed at which the Russian propaganda machine spewed out allegations against Ukraine after the crash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Insider media outlet claimed that the speed indicates advance planning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the first to be ready with well-oiled rhetoric against Ukraine was ex-deputy defence minister Col-Gen Andrey Kartapolov, a pro-war MP and trusted loyalist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It seems that the situation was planned and Kartapolov is acting as a media mediator for the spread of Russian disinformation,” said the report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This likely had a “multi-layered goal: to convince Ukraine&#8217;s allies that the supply of air defence systems is ‘dangerous’ for Ukrainians themselves, to find an excuse for Russian mothers, why the Russian Federation stops exchanges, transfer responsibility to Ukraine and other layers of the operation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, seen as a Putin lacky, was also on hand with his invective attacking Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State TV and pro-Putin media seized the moment to blame Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Shot media accepted the official playbook without question and reported: &#8220;The youngest Ukrainian prisoner to die on board the Il-76 was 21-year-old Ivan Roy&#8230;.Today he was killed by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, there is no proof of his death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a> has said&nbsp;&nbsp;the Il-76 aircraft was shot down by three missiles of the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patriot or German-made&nbsp;&nbsp;IRIS-T surface-to-air missile system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The launch of two Ukrainian missiles was observed by radar means of the Russian Air Force,” said the defence ministry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet no evidence was given to prove this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could the Russians have blown the plane out of the sky?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Witnesses spoke of two explosions before the plane hit the ground, which could have been bombs or missiles or some other cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plane-crashes-air-disasters/\">Air crashes</a> caused by friendly fire from the Russian side have been a feature of the war. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More sinister, Wagner warlord <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/yevgeny-prigozhin/\">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a>’s plane is widely seen to have crashed after a bomb exploded on board in June last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bomb is suspected to have been planted with Vladimir Putin’s knowledge to wipe out the top leadership of Wagner which were no longer useful for him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine later appeared to admit it had targeted the Il-76, while not commenting on the military plane &nbsp;having Kyiv PoWs on board, as <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a> has alleged.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement implied such <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/transport/\">transport</a> planes are used for moving missiles close to the war zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced against the background of the downing of the Russian Il-76 military transport plane that the Defence Forces are closely monitoring the logistics of the supply of missiles in order to reduce the missile threat to Kharkiv region,” said an official statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The recorded intensity of shelling is directly related to the increase in the number of military transport planes that have recently been heading to the Belgorod airfield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Taking this into account, the Armed Forces will continue to take measures to destroy means of delivery, control the airspace to destroy the terrorist threat, including in the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last week alone Russia had staged 19 missile attacks on Kharkiv region, killing 16 people including one child, said the statement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>78 people were wounded. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25477797\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 399px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

class=\"suggested-link\">next</span> five years if a major global conflicts was to break out &#8211; focusing on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196707/russia/\">Russia</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a>&nbsp;bot &#8211; the ever-evolving creation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/openai/\">OpenAI</a>&nbsp;&#8211; works via machine learning and is used by people worldwide to generate text, answer questions and even have thoughtful conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its super machine mind is a tightly packed together box of information so after a series of questions and prompts, the AI let our curious reporter in on just how a potential <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-3/\">WW3 </a>might end up looking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What followed was a string of predictions that outlined the catastrophic world events that could come in 2024 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most worrying of all the predictions, was the scarily high number of potential deaths the AI thinks could happen in the major conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT started off its predictions with the following message: &#8220;It&#8217;s important to reiterate that these hypothetical scenarios are entirely fictional, speculative, and not based on any real-world events or predictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they still offer a fascinating window into the developing <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/power-2/\">power</a> of the machine and just how far it can go in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/future/\">future</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next 11 months, ChatGPT has warned that in their scenario there will be a &#8220;triggering event&#8221; that will set the terrifying wheels in motion for a &#8220;sudden escalation&#8221; of tensions between Russia and the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They described this event as &#8220;a series of diplomatic breakdowns, cyber attacks, and accusations&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the original issues are caused, the AI bot then says a set of <span id=\"5fa66af0-7385-4ac9-91fc-95f08e84264a\" class=\"suggested-link\">mini</span> &#8220;skirmishes&#8221; will occur to further heat up the growing political divide across the

this point both Russia and the US will mobilise their military forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the fighting continues into 2025, the AI predicts that it will only worsen in a period they call the &#8220;expansion of conflict&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They responded: &#8220;The conflict expands into a larger <a

intensify, impacting critical infrastructure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of clashes, in which the death toll starts to rise, ChatGPT says alliances will start to clearly form. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US are set to strengthen their friendship with NATO members as Russia grows closer to &#8220;certain regional partners&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the year when WW3 will be all but declared as the rest of the world gets involved &#8211; including mega powers across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chat tool said: &#8220;Other major powers, such as <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/\">China</a>, become involved in the conflict, either directly or indirectly, complicating the geopolitical landscape.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These complications result in a number of proxy wars emerging as more and more regional conflicts start as part of the wider US-Russia conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is set to only &#8220;further exacerbate the situation&#8221; according to the technologies guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25478934\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

economic, and humanitarian issues on a global scale&#8217; after the devastation left behind in the war[/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2027</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to ChatGPT, the growing fear over <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/\">nuclear weapons</a> won&#8217;t reach boiling point until 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they don&#8217;t think a nuke will be yet due to the major concerns all parties involved have over the devastation they could cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead they wrote: &#8220;The conflict escalates to the point where there are concerns about the use of nuclear weapons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The international community intensifies efforts to broker a ceasefire.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ceasefire comes as a &#8220;humanitarian crisis&#8221; has plagued the fighting as a significant number of people have been killed both as soldiers and as civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI also notes that the world will experience &#8220;widespread suffering&#8221; in 2027 as the world war continues to rumble on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2028</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After four years of fighting and millions of lives lost, many countries will begin to rethink their stance on the war, according to ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They think that the world will see several attempts at a ceasefire and constant peace negotiations taking place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the demand for a stop in action all bids are repeatedly undermined and shut down as hostilities continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also cited &#8220;deep-rooted distrust&#8221; amongst countries as one of the main factors for a lack in positive communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consequences of war have already been felt in terms of lives lost and utter devastation of land but by 2028 the AI predicts severe &#8220;economic consequences&#8221; as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It told us: &#8220;Global <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/markets/\">markets</a> will experience severe disruptions, causing economic downturns worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Year 2029</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final year of warfare will centre around negotiations as both Russia and the US struggle to overcome each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT tells us: &#8220;The conflict reaches a stalemate, with neither side able to secure a decisive victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;International pressure forces both nations back to the negotiating table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plans to end WW3 are put in place after years of heavy losses and destruction across the globe as plans for a post-war world are made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reconstruction period will see the world face an immense challenge to bring itself back to an era of normality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have to work hard to &#8220;address political, economic, and humanitarian issues on a global scale&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT placed the number of deaths across the five years of fighting in the &#8220;tens of millions&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They went on to say: &#8220;The number of casualties in any hypothetical conflict depends on a myriad of factors, including military strategies, geopolitical developments, and the international response.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this number being speculative and arbitrary they did say this number could rise to well above 20million.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will there be nukes in WW3?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT gave several reasons why nuclear weapons wouldn&#8217;t be used &#8211; even in a hypothetical war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They mentioned Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) as a big reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This theory suggests that if one nation launches a nuke the other would respond with a devastating counterattack within moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates fear amongst countries to not use them to avoid being attacked themselves in retaliation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also cited the impact it would have on people as a factor in nukes not being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI system said: &#8220;The catastrophic humanitarian consequences of a nuclear exchange, including immediate loss of life, long-term <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/\">health</a> effects, and environmental devastation, make the use of nuclear weapons ethically unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There exists a global norm against the use of nuclear weapons. This is a powerful psychological barrier that discourages leaders from considering the use of nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>International Treaties and Agreements were also signposted as both the US and Russia are signed up to various international agreements, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final reason centred around &#8220;strategic and tactical considerations&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They continued: &#8220;Leaders understand that the use of nuclear weapons could escalate a conflict to an uncontrollable level, making strategic and tactical considerations favouring conventional warfare over nuclear engagement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">The &#039;real&#039;

and his likeability earned him a legion of adoring fans, and a wife, during his murder trial in 1980.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10934012/grinning-ted-bundy-told-me-id-be-a-good-serial-killer-and-called-me-his-homeboy-i-even-organised-his-wedding/\">true extent of his vile crimes were exposed</a>, some still couldn&#8217;t fathom how the handsome <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/law/\">law</a> student could be capable of such cruelty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundy was finally executed by&nbsp;electric chair&nbsp;on January 24, 1989 after his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/murderers-serial-killers/\">sick murder spree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sex with victims after death</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After killing his victims, Bundy frequently visited their bodies to groom and perform sex acts on them until they decomposed or were destroyed by wild animals to a point where it was no longer possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is known to have decapitated at least 12 of his victims and kept their severed heads in his apartment, as mementos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about this ritual, he said: &#8220;When you work hard to do something right, you don’t want to forget it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One corpse, that of 18-year-old university student Georgann Hawkins, he admitted to revisiting on three occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundy also described shampooing the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hair/\">hair</a> of, and applying makeup to, the corpses of two 17-year-old girls who he had raped and killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is said to have groomed the women he murdered before <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8864781/ted-bundy-severed-heads-sex-acts/\">using their detached heads to perform sex acts on himself</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Targeting children</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sick murderer <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17171566/how-to-spot-psychopaths-ted-bundy-charles-manson/\">employed a number of tactics</a> to win the trust of his victims, or gain their sympathy, before kidnapping them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He even preyed on schoolgirls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partially-mummified remains of 12-year-old Kimberly Dianne Leach were found seven weeks after she disappeared from her high school &#8211; in a pig farrowing shed 35 miles away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forensic experts determined that she was raped, her throat was slit, and her genitals were mutilated with a knife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundy also confessed to killing 12-year-old&nbsp;Lynette Dawn Culver; he abducted and raped her, then drowned her in Idaho.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Murder kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A chilling collection of items, including a ski mask, a mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, an ice pick, and a coil of rope, were discovered in Bundy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/volkswagen/\">Volkswagen</a> in 1975.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The murderer was arrested by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who observed him take off at a high speed upon seeing the cop car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundy tried to explain away the items, claiming the ski mask was for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/skiing/\">skiing</a> and that he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span id=\"8abd164e-75f3-4fcf-9967-971d31ec19dc\" class=\"suggested-link\">Police</span> searched his apartment and found some other items related to his crimes, although the murderer later said they missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs he had taken of his victims.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biting his victims</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bundy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10006932/ted-bundy-survivors-drunk-killer-crushed-bones-faces/\">incomprehensible, animalistic actions</a> included him leaving bite wounds on his victims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this habit, for which he earned the nickname &#8220;The Love-Bite Killer&#8221;, that ultimately led to his conviction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horrifically, after entering a sorority house through a faulty door, he tore the left nipple of 20-year-old Lisa Janet Levy, also biting deeply into her left buttock, strangling her, and beating her unconscious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At trial, incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds he inflicted on the young woman, which forensic experts matched to castings of Bundy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/teeth/\">teeth</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The link ultimately helped convict him for his crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practising before murders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no denying Bundy derived pleasure from his killings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He himself once described the urge he felt to kill as a &#8220;chemical tidal wave washing through his brain&#8221;, and seemed to view murder as a sport &#8211;

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a> launched a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">large-scale invasion of Ukraine</a> and tensions between Russia and the West continue to rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact death toll is unknown, officials claim Russia has lost more than 360,000 troops, while Ukraine has lost close to 70,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, estimates say that at least 10,000 civilians have been killed since <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Ukraine was invaded (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ukraine was invaded</a> in February 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many fear the crisis in Ukraine could still develop into a wider armed conflict, with officials warning that further escalation could see the bloodiest conflict in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Europe (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Europe</a> since <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-2/\">WW2</a> if resulting in nuclear war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with reports of <a aria-label=\"Putin’s

courageously ever since and continued to defy the odds by defending itself against Russian onslaughts with the help of Western <a aria-label=\"military (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">military</a> aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2022, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-war-3/\">WW3</a> tensions grew after it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17891032/will-russia-invade-poland/\">Russian-built missiles crossed into Poland</a>, a Nato country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the stray missile was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20438187/two-killed-russian-rockets-poland-nato/\">likely fired

Korea his &#8220;principal enemy&#8221;</a> &#8211; adding that the nuclear weapons at his disposal are not to be ignored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This came just days after his sister and prominent ally

to the brink of World War Three</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret documents described Putin&#8217;s possible &#8220;path to conflict&#8221; which would reach its climax in 2025 on &#8220;Day X&#8221; when half a million&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/\">Nato</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russian</a>&nbsp;soldiers face each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

– including its proximity to&nbsp;war-hungry Russia&nbsp;– makes it unlikely that their request to join the organisation will be accepted any time soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands, their non membership means that, amid invasion, Nato’s support is limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is despite the unanimous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17753075/boris-johnson-russia-ukraine-announcement/\">backing of the West</a>&nbsp;– including the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"

expansion into Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was formed with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 by 12 member states</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, it has expanded to 30 member

boyfriend&#8217;s flat in the city of Belo Horizonte, in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/\">Brazilian </a>state of Minas Gerais, on February 23 last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite taking four bullets, she managed to leave the flat and flee downstairs, where she was rescued and taken to hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belo Horizonte Jury <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/court-2/\">Court</a> has now sentenced Weldrin Lopes de Alcantar, 44, to five years and eight months in <a

defendant&#8217;s actions were driven by violent emotion as a result of the victim&#8217;s threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resulted in the removal of the qualifier of the mitigation of the sentence, according to local media.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8216;PRIVILEGED AND BLESSED&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge <span id=\"3279f839-785b-4e07-bffa-ff7a622ca559\" class=\"suggested-link\">Thiago</span> Grazziane Gandra said: &#8220;The sentencing council partially accepted the accusation and decided that the defendant committed against the victim, Ellen Cristina Otoni Campos, the crime of attempted murder, qualified by femicide and by the resource that made the victim&#8217;s defence difficult, with the privilege of violent emotion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Ellen posted a thank you message to everybody who supported her on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/\">social media</a> when she celebrated her 38th birthday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told them: &#8220;You are the heroes after this victory and this miracle&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the post, she also said that she felt &#8220;privileged and blessed&#8221; to have survived and added that 2023 would be a &#8220;year of rebirth and a lot of gratitude for life&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, Ellen, 37, had been waiting for her boyfriend for two hours at the front door of his apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the alleged attacker, Weldrin Lopes de Alcantara, finally arrived home by car, they went inside the flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FLED ON FOOT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents of the apartment block then reported hearing a fight, followed by about seven shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De Alcantara, 44, then reportedly tried to flee by car, but the electric gate failed to open, so he abandoned his car and fled on foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He remained at large for days before handing himself in to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/\">police</a> on February 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During questioning, the musclebound attacker told the police that Ellen had been threatening him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said that he had acted in self-defence and claimed he was not even Ellen&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local media quoted him as saying: &#8220;She showed up at my house unexpectedly. I wasn&#8217;t expecting Ellen there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">THREATENED SON</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We had a few encounters. We hooked up several times, but it never went beyond that, precisely because she&#8217;s a very aggressive and violent person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I said I wanted to distance myself, she would threaten me and threaten herself. She even threatened my three-year-old son.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boy is believed to have been at the scene at the time of the shooting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De Alcantara&#8217;s lawyer, Lais Fonseca, has claimed that her client fired the shots accidentally while trying to unload his gun after Ellen tried to grab it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, police did not believe this version of events and arrested De Alcantara on remand for attempted femicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors said she suffered wounds to the left side of her jaw, the back of her head, her left shoulder, and her left thigh.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">What is femicide?</h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>Femicide is generally used to describe the crime of killing a woman or women on the basis of their gender.</p>\n<p>It does not exist as a definition in UK law, instead falling under manslaughter or murder.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Brazil passed a new law on femicide to tackle the rise of gender killings.</p>\n<p>The nation joined 15 other Latin American countries in bringing in laws against femicide.</p>\n<p>Nadine Gasman, head of the agency United Nations Women in Brazil, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: &#8220;This law typifies femicide as a grave crime and identifies it as a specific crime against women. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to talk about this problem, make it visible by giving it a name and increasing sanctions for this crime.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has taken us a long time to say that the killing of a woman is a different phenomenon. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Men are killed in the street, women are killed in the home. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Men are killed with guns, women with knives and hands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Figures show that in 2022, approximately 1.4 per 100,000 Brazilian women were killed on account of their gender.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>Police seized a .38 calibre revolver from the apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victim is the niece of Reimont Luiz Otoni Santa Barbara &#8211; a member of the Chamber of Deputies of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/\">Brazil</a> for the Workers&#8217; Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wrote online: &#8220;Last year, violence numbers hit a record high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This shows us that we need to fight tirelessly for the strengthening of public policies that embrace, defend, and raise awareness.

strikes targeted facilities in Jurf al-Sakhar, which is south of Baghdad, al-Qaim and another unnamed site in western Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack was a retaliation after a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25430645/rockets-attack-usa-airbase-army-iraq/\">ballistic missile ambush at the American Al-Asad airbase</a> on Saturday which left four US military personnel with traumatic brain injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain and the US blasted the &#8220;reckless and illegal&#8221; actions of Houthi terrorists in the Red Sea after their <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25451904/britain-launches-2nd-blitz-on-houthi-rebels/\">joint operation in Yemen on Monday</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Central Command said in a statement posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/\">X</a> on Tuesday that they hit three locations used by the terror group <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8508394/who-hezbollah-why-ban-uk-terror/\">Hezbollah</a> and &#8220;other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said: &#8220;US CENTCOM forces conducted unilateral airstrikes against three facilities used by Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These strikes targeted KH headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US also launched a strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen, targeting two anti-ship missiles that posed an “imminent threat” to vessels in the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Central Command said the strikes were “missiles that were aimed into the southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“US forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US navy ships in the region.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, America and Britain said in a new joint statement on Tuesday evening that the Yemeni strikes come amid &#8220;continued illegal and reckless Houthi attacks&#8221; on ships in the Red Sea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In response to continued illegal and reckless Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waterways, the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, conducted additional strikes against eight targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These strikes were designed to disrupt and degrade the capability of the Houthis to continue their attacks on global trade and innocent mariners from around the world, while avoiding escalation,&#8221; they said of Monday&#8217;s hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US airbases across the Middle East &#8211; particularly in Iraq and Syria &#8211; have faced an onslaught of missile attacks in recent weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to Western support for Israel amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, different Iran-backed militias have launched around 150 assaults.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Christmas Day, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25163163/joe-biden-strikes-attack-iraq-military-base-kataib-hezbollah/\">Hezbollah targeted the&nbsp;Erbil Air Base in Iraq</a> &#8211; injuring three American military personnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as British and American aid workers have been asked to leave Yemen amid the allied strikes by Houthi authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a letter from the Houthi-controlled foreign affairs ministry to the country&#8217;s UN coordinator seen by Sky &#8211; the Iran-backed rebel group is asking aid workers with US or UK citizenship to leave Yemen within 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3

Defence Lloyd Austin added on Tuesday: &#8220;U.S. military forces conducted necessary and proportionate strikes on three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against U.S. and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Saturday&#8217;s attack on American military, US Central Command said: &#8220;Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base’s air defence systems while others impacted on the base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a

Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also claimed responsibility for the drone strikes on al-Omar oil field, a US base in eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/syria/\">Syria</a>, the drone strikes on Al-Harir airbase, Iraq and the shooting down of a US MQ-9 Reaper drone in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kuwait/\">Kuwait</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are roughly 2,500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria &#8211; a hangover from occupation in the area and an attempt to monitor Islamic extremist threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defence chief Austin added: &#8220;The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite reports from Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani&#8217;s office that the country was making moves to evict US forces &#8211; the Pentagon has said it has yet to be formally notified of any such plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just weeks ago another <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25251118/us-drone-strike-kills-harakat-al-nujaba-commander-iraq/\">US strike in capital Baghdad took out Iran-backed militia commander Abu Taqwa Al-Saedi</a> &#8211;&nbsp;who had masterminded recent attacks on American troops stationed in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hit was strongly condemned by the Iraqi government as leader Sudani dubbed it a dangerous escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iraq&#8217;s foreign ministry said: &#8220;Iraq reserves its right to take a firm stance and take all measures that deter anyone who tries to harm its land and security forces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Abu Aqeel al Moussawi, a local Iraqi militia commander, warned: &#8220;We will make the Americans regret carrying out this aggression.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Iraq has been hit by strikes amid the rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just days ago <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25373902/israel-hamas-war-iran-iraq-revenge-houthi-hezbollah/\">Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guards bombarded Israel&#8217;s so-called &#8220;spy headquarters&#8221; in Iraq</a> with ballistic missiles aimed near the US consulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13547405/iran-revolutionary-guards-terror-qasem-soleimani/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20then%20find%20British%20people,globe%2C%20from%20Argentina%20to%20Thailand.&amp;text=It%20is%20is%20currently%20led,more%20than%20190%2C000%20active%20personnel.\">The warped terrorist army</a>&nbsp;claimed responsibility for the brazen ambush which killed four and injured six others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The war between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">Israel and Hamas</a>&nbsp;following from the October 7 massacre has seen Syria, Yemen and Lebanon dragged into fighting in the Middle East alongside Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25283910/israel-assassinates-hezbollah-commander-al-tawil/\">Israeli strikes have hit Lebanon, killing over 130 Hezbollah fighters</a>&nbsp;including <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25242467/hezbollah-leader-hussein-yazbek-killed-in-lebanon/\">some key commanders</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And almost 20 more Hezbollah militants were killed by strikes in Syria.<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25373902/israel-hamas-war-iran-iraq-revenge-houthi-hezbollah/#\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite attacks on US bases, the Pentagon has said its troops maintain their presence in Iraq at the invitation of its government. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rishi-sunak/\">Rishi Sunak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;warned Iranian-backed militants that they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/25451458/sunak-and-biden-warn-more-strikes/\">would strike Yemen again</a>&nbsp;&#8220;if needed&#8221; following Monday&#8217;s mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pentagon said they successfully hit eight targets &#8211; including an underground bunker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it follows the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25339157/houthi-red-sea-yemen-uk-us-jets-israel-gaza/\">successful initial joint operation on January 12 </a>which saw the allied countries blitz more Houthi targets in a meticulously planned mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign Secretary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/david-cameron/\">David Cameron</a>&nbsp;said the strikes sent the &#8220;clearest possible message&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24547455\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AFP_9U78EP-JS742120651.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"US soldiers attend a joint military exercise between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the US-led international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group, in the countryside of Deir Ezzor in northeastern Syria on December 7, 2021.

an emblem of the entire Korean Peninsula[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Chilling satellite pictures taken on January 8 and later on January 23 appear to show the monument standing tall before it&#8217;s replaced by a gaping hole in the city&#8217;s capital, Pyongyang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korean tyrant Kim had previously slammed the &#8220;eye-sore&#8221; arch for representing &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; with the South amid rising tensions between the two countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arch, known as The Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification, depicts two women from North Korea and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/5759409/south-korea/\">South Korea</a> holding hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arch is visible in the first image but not in the second, according to a report by an online outlet that monitors North Korea, NK <span id=\"94963681-9c86-4367-a584-396201417948\" class=\"suggested-link\">News</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aerial snap taken on January 23, a large dark dent in the ground looks to have opened up where the landmark once stood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sun could not independently confirm that the Arch of Reunification had been demolished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains unclear precisely when or how it may have been removed, but it was last seen standing in a photograph taken on January 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The apparent demolition comes after Kim called the arch an &#8220;eye-sore&#8221; on January 15 and ordered that it be &#8220;completely removed … to completely eliminate such concepts as ‘reunification,’ ‘reconciliation’ and ‘fellow countrymen’ from the national <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/history/\">history</a> of our Republic&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also ordered that the constitution be amended to call the South a &#8220;primary foe and invariable principal enemy,&#8221; official media reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Completed in 2001, the iconic landmark stood about 100ft tall and was 200ft wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The women in the statue are holding an emblem of the outline of the entire Korean Peninsula, according to a now-deleted page on the DPRK-run website Naenara.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page stated: &#8220;It highlights that the Koreans are a homogeneous nation with one territory, the same blood and one language from ancient times, and that all the fellow countrymen should turn out in the struggle for national reunification, true to the three charters.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three charters of national reunification, proposed by the former president of North Korea Kim Il Sung in 1972, are independence, peaceful reunification and national unity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tensions between the North and South have flared again following intensifying military drills by the South Korean and US forces in response to weapons testing by North Korea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-jong-un/\">Kim Jong-un</a>&#8216;s sister <a

living underwater[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Before visiting the resort, he pre-booked the room as an additional experience, paying $1,100 for the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun, who has been to some amazing beach hotels and private islands, said it was one of the best experiences he ever had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;I have been lucky enough to stay in some amazing safari lodges, beach hotels, and private islands through my work, but for me, the Underwater Room was one of the best experiences.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am not sure there is anything like this anywhere else on earth, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wishes to try something completely unique!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun filmed his stay his entire stay in the underwater room and uploaded it on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/\">Instagram</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clip has since gained more than eight million views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25456158/worlds-tallest-fastest-waterslide-thrillseekers-plummet/\">thrill-seeker </a>first shows the above-water part of the room, which has a shower, sofa area, a deck, and a ladder to the roof terrace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real deal is the room underwater which steps down 13ft below the ocean &#8211; and is accessed by a tunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The room boasts multiple large windows on each wall &#8211; and can be used to watch aquatic animals swim around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun said in the video he was able to see lots of tropical fish and other aquatic animals that lived around that area, including turtles and octopuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He even saw a giant fish outside the room which came to feed on the smaller ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaun said: &#8220;From the underwater room, I saw lots of tropical fish that live around the floating room, using it for shelter as if it was part of the reef.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At night when I turned the underwater lights on, bigger fish came to feed on the smaller ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I even got to see some turtles and octopuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing challenges like claustrophobia, Shaun said that the experience was so good it made him forget about other worries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was worried I would be claustrophobic sleeping in the room underwater, but again because the experience is so amazing, you very quickly forget about any worries!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The floating room is secured to the bottom of the ocean floor, making it very sturdy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You hardly notice any movement!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Shaun says he had one the best experiences in life &#8211; and highly recommends other people to go for it at least once, his online fans do not seem to be convinced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighting some scary drawbacks, like anxiety and claustrophobia, most of his followers said they would never spend even a single night living underwater. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such person said: &#8220;My anxiety would never allow me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one wrote: &#8220;That’s gonna be a no from me dog.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third said:  &#8220;Imagine waking up in the middle of the night and a sea creature staring at you though.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a fourth person wrote: &#8220;What happens in the ocean is none of my f***ng business.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One last critic expressed: &#8220;This would be the worst night sleep of my LIFE.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, other viewers were keen to try the thrilling experience themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such

work[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Despite needing permission from authorities for any kind of street art in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/singapore/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Singapore (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Singapore</a>, the Peace Centre has provided a rare space for self-expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the building, which is around half a century old,  is scheduled to face the wrecking ball later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in August, PlayPan, an initiative co-founded by entrepreneur Gary Hong, convinced developers to postpone the mall&#8217;s demolition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were told that they could go ahead and use the space for &#8220;a social experiment to bring (the) community together&#8221;, Hong told AFP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were given the space to host performances and workshops for several months, allowing artists, students, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/charity/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"charities (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">charities</a> and small businesses to set up shop for free or at heavily discounted rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eclectic mix of pop-up stores, art tours and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/music/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"musical (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">musical</a> performances has transformed the once lacklustre mall into an unexpected art haven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of January, however, the mall will close definitively, bringing an end to the art project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peace Centre was once a popular mall but lost its shine to glitzier <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"shopping (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shopping</a> centres that mushroomed over recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two decades it was mostly known for its printing shops and seedy karaoke lounges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its revamp into an art space, young people have attended graffiti workshops, colouring shuttered shopfronts with spray cans while punters browsed through second-hand clothing stalls and exhibits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not something you do on a normal weekend, less so inside an indoor area, in a mall,&#8221; said Darryl Poh, a 29-year-old sales trader who took part in a spray-painting workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bathroom walls and mirrors were splattered with graffiti, while a Rage Against the Machine song blared from one of the pop-up stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Craft cocktails were served on the ground floor and nearby, death metal CDs and trinkets were on sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such spaces are uncommon in Singapore, a top financial hub in Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think you just got to know where to look. The government can curate things, but people are still going to do their own thing,&#8221; said Ning Fei, 34, who was selling typewritten poems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outer walls were plastered with flyers advertising activities from ukulele classes to pebble painting, while a futuristic mural welcomed visitors arriving at the main entrance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gabriel, a 43-year-old photographer who asked to be identified only by his first name, set up a booth to take portraits of passersby for charity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The energy here was really exciting. There were a lot of things you don&#8217;t typically see in Singapore malls,&#8221; he told AFP, describing the vibe as &#8220;very non-Singaporean, very organic&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss this community very much. I&#8217;m glad to have plugged in and participated in this swan song.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, a mall that once boomed with shoppers <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25258728/abandoned-shopping-centre-zombie-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"now looks like a scene from a Zombie apocalypse (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">now looks like a scene from a Zombie apocalypse</a>, causing widespread outrage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horrifying images show a deplorable state of the Market Square in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Australia (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Australia</a>, where broken glass, graffiti and rubbish are strewn everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a luxury estate in southern <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/malaysia/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Malaysia (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Malaysia</a> built by the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Chinese (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chinese</a> has been left to rot &#8211;

One day he told me how happy he was about his daughter&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/marriage-2/\">marriage</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-becker/\">Boris Becker</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The next time I saw him he told me they had broken up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung revealed that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25402188/incest-monster-josef-fritzl-son-jail-visit/\">sick Fritzl was visited in prison by a man claiming to be his son</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man, who went to see the incest monster in Stein&nbsp;Prison, told him: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re my dad, a justice official revealed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newspaper reported that Fritzl once had an &#8220;affair&#8221; with the man&#8217;s mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One justice, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the man&#8217;s visit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They told The Sun: &#8220;Yes, this person exists. There has been a visit. That claim in the Kronen Zeitung is accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is possible that he is his son, who knows?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, a deluded Fritzl spoke about his dream of freedom for the first time &#8211; and bizarrely told The Sun he wants to live to be 130.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twisted beast, through his lawyer Wagner, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22313646/josef-fritzl-first-interview-grandkids-family/\">made a rambling statement that he would meet his family once again</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;I definitely believe that I am going to see them again one day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25460540\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/washington-dc/\">Washington DC</a> by the&nbsp;Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which organises the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;Doomsday Clock&nbsp;has been left untouched, reflecting a “continuing and unprecedented level of risk”, according to the Bulletin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the same number as last year, when it marked the closest to midnight it has ever been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scientists who created the clock stressed that choosing not to modify it should not lead to complacency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said said the threats posed by Vladimir Putin and his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">war with Ukraine</a> continue, with Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson saying how the horror <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">October 7 attacks in Israel</a> added an extra source of concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Middle East has become a powder keg unsettled by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">Israel&#8217;s ongoing war</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a>, Iran-backed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25367203/vessel-hit-rocket-yemen-houthi/\">Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea</a>, and recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25389552/china-response-iranian-strike-pakistan/\">clashes and strikes between Iran and Pakistan.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite the heightened and new hazards, there was some good news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bulletin acknowledged that there has been some progress in responding to climate change, but&nbsp;the challenge continues to imperil humanity&#8217;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also highlighted the weakening of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/\">nuclear weapons</a> reduction agreements, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/climate-change-environment/\">climate change</a>, new genetic engineering technologies and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a>, and the dangers of disinformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world has been moving towards the brink of WW3 as tyrants <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-jong-un/\">Kim Jong-un</a> and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a> have sent a chilling warning to the West&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thesun.co.uk/news/25436902/kim-jong-un-putin-new-world-order-chilling-warning/\">as they vowed to form a &#8220;New World Order&#8221;</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warnings of a potential new world order had already been given by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25402467/putin-lavrov-new-world-order-ww3-speech/\">Putin&#8217;s warmonger foreign minister Sergei Lavrov</a>, who told the West that their time of &#8220;global domination&#8221; is over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And veteran&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russian</a>&nbsp;MP Alexander Osovtsov said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25422204/ww3-already-begun-russia-north-korea-putin-enemy/\">World War Three has already begun</a>&nbsp;for the West&#8217;s enemies and &#8220;we&#8217;re all participating in it&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25429565/baltic-bunkers-trenches-dragons-teeth-putins-war-nato/\">Baltic states are racing to bolster defences on their borders with Russia and Belarus</a>&nbsp;as Europe braces for an all-out war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25402241/doomsday-clock-who-controls-sets/\">The Doomsday Clock</a>&nbsp;operates as a wake-up call for the world about global threats such as nuclear war, dangerous technologies and mass health concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used as a metaphor to signal how close the human race is to self-destruction by its distance from midnight, it is reset around the same time in January each year by varying lengths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Pavel Podvig, an expert on&nbsp;Weapons of Mass Destruction&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/united-nations/\">UN</a>, told The Sun that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25453237/doomsday-clock-dangerous-nuclear-weapons-ww3/\">nuclear war is a &#8220;truly terrifying prospect&#8221;</a> &#8211; and something that must be ruled out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He warned of the dangers of &#8220;unstable personalities&#8221; being in charge of nuclear arsenals &#8211; including Putin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kim Jong-un.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pavel also said that unpredictable &#8220;accidents&#8221; in warzones could lead to uncontrolled escalation and warned of the deaths of billions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told The Sun: &#8220;The number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/\">nuclear weapons</a>&nbsp;that exist, they would have the potential to end the life as we know it, and the numbers are truly terrifying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It runs from the tens of millions of people dead in that in the matter of hours. And I&#8217;ve seen estimates that suggest that the consequences, like the nuclear&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/\">winter</a>, would could lead to the death of billions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the simulations and estimates, and the numbers, and there could be 40 to 50 million people dead in the matter of a couple of hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So it is [a] truly terrifying prospect&#8230; That&#8217;s something we want to rule out to make sure that this could never happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Pavel did say that a nuclear war is unlikely to happen &#8211; despite Vladimir Putin&#8217;s threats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told The Sun that it wouldn&#8217;t make &#8220;any military sense&#8221; for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a> to unleash nukes on the battlefield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are not there at the point when the very existence of Russia is in danger. We are not anywhere [near] there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the threshold for making a decision to unleash nuclear weapons is high, they exist and they can be used, Pavel said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UN expert also explained how escalation could lead to nuclear war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My worst case scenario would be that Russia at some point may decide to escalate the conflict and actually attack native states in one way or another,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And then we we may enter into this kind of a cycle of responses that could start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that if something like that would happen, it would start with the conventional conflict of national attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But then again, there are ways for this this kind of exchange to escalate to a nuclear level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other scenarios include the &#8220;unstable personalities&#8221; in charge of nuclear weapons &#8211; including Vlad and Kim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another is unpredictable &#8220;accidents&#8221;, particularly in active warzones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pavel also painted a chilling picture of Vlad&#8217;s access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;There is a button on the president&#8217;s desk that he could push and everything fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know exactly how people would behave in these kind of circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But it is very difficult to imagine the president summoning his generals and basically telling them, &#8216;okay, you just go ahead and you just kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people in one go&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header

&#8211; one minute and 30 seconds &#8211; came last January.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a> &#8211; creators of the clock &#8211; formed it in 1947 based on the nuclear threat.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until later that natural risks like climate change were considered as well.</p>\n<p>Despite it&#8217;s concerning meaning &#8211; it is meant to serve as a warning and is not a real clock.</p>\n<p>Even if it strikes midnight &#8211; all hell will not break loose. </p>\n<p>But the scientists who created it and view nuclear war as our biggest threat intend it to be taken seriously as an indicator of how dangerous the world has become.</p>\n<p>And in our current climate, amid a backdrop of exploding global conflict, it could well be set closer to midnight in 2024.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25456345\"

</a>on January 20, paid an eye-popping AED398,630 (£85,000). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the steak chef &#8211; named<a

beef carpaccio, three golden steaks priced at £1,100, and a golden filet mignon at £240.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even a single portion of chips cost them a choking £10.70.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compliment the meat

meal with a round of doubles of exclusive Louis XIII cognac for another £6,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill shows they even coughed up £19,000 just in tips!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salt Bae shamelessly captioned his post: &#8220;Money comes, money goes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the blatant brag brought a flood of protest from local and social media &#8211; especially from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/\">Turkey</a>, his home country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many felt it was an insult to ordinary hard-working Turks who are struggling to cope with more than 60 per cent inflation and a 10 per cent unemployment rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People flocked to the comment section to criticise the unrealistic prices at Salt Bae&#8217;s restaurant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such person said: &#8220;This is a case when people have more money than common sense.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another wrote: &#8220;My carpenter can cook better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turkish newspaper <a

Nusr-Et</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It included £15 for a side of mashed potatoes and £804 for a steak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenting on the bill, the food blogger said: &#8220;In what universe does spaghetti cost 80 bucks per serving????&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One user was appalled and slammed the restaurant saying: &#8220;Tomahawk steaks and JW Blue! Overpriced garbage for people who don&#8217;t know any better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another person added: &#8220;Although I&#8217;ve never met them I am positive that these people are a**holes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/5865661/salt-bae-chef-nusret-gokce-david-beckham-mesut-ozil-man-city/\">Salt Bae</a> rose to fame for his unique salt-sprinkling technique which has helped him achieve a net worth of £64million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His restaurant chain Nusr-Et has over 20 locations in Turkey, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/greece/\">Greece</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/uk/\">UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/uae/\">UAE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/qatar/\">Qatar </a>and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/saudi-arabia/\">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_25459109\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nusr-et-four-season-dubai-874025627.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-25459109\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Nusr ET</figcredit></figure>The diners paid the staggering bill at Nusr Et Four Season in Dubai[/caption]\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Full Breakdown of the £85,000 dinner </h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>1 Beef Carpaccio &#8211;
