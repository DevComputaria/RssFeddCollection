I suspect many of us are prone to looking at this in a very binary fashion: if the data is publicly accessible anyway, scraping it poses no risk. But in my view, there&apos;s a hell of a big difference between say, looking at one person&apos;s personal info on LinkedIn via the browser versus having a corpus of millions of records of the same data saved offline. That&apos;s before we even get into the issue of whether in Trello&apos;s case, it should <em>ever </em>be possible for a third party to match email address to username and IRL name.</p><p>To add some more perspective, I&apos;ve just posted a poll immediately before publishing this blog post, let&apos;s see what the masses have to say:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scraping: should we be concerned if an individual&apos;s personal data is scraped, aggregated en mass and redistributed if that same data is already publicly accessible on the service anyway?

Here&apos;s the back story: this week I was contacted by a well-known tech company that had received a bug bounty submission based on a credential stuffing list posted to a popular hacking forum:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-13-08.png\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\"></figure>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Whilst this post dates back almost 4 months, it hadn&apos;t come across my radar until now and inevitably, also hadn&apos;t been sent to the aforementioned tech company. They took it seriously enough to take appropriate action against their (very sizeable) user base which gave me enough cause to investigate it further than your average cred stuffing list. Here&apos;s what I found:</p><ol><li>319 files totalling 104GB</li><li>70,840,771 unique email addresses</li><li>427,308 individual HIBP subscribers impacted</li><li>65.03% of addresses already in HIBP (based on a 1k random sample set)</li></ol><p>That last number was the real kicker; when a third of the email addresses have never been seen before, that&apos;s statistically significant. This isn&apos;t just the usual collection of repurposed lists wrapped up with a brand-new bow on it and passed off as the next big thing; it&apos;s a significant volume of new data. When you look at the above forum post the data accompanied, the reason why becomes clear: it&apos;s from &quot;stealer logs&quot; or in other words, malware that has grabbed credentials from compromised machines. Apparently, this was sourced from <a href=\"https://www.hackread.com/osint-tool-illicit-services-shuts-down/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the now defunct illicit.services website</a> which (in)famously provided search results for other people&apos;s data along these lines:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/osint-tool-illicit-services-shuts-down-1024x676.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/osint-tool-illicit-services-shuts-down-1024x676.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/osint-tool-illicit-services-shuts-down-1024x676.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/osint-tool-illicit-services-shuts-down-1024x676.jpg 1024w\"></figure><p>I was aware of this service because, well, just look at the first example query &#x1F926;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F; </p><p>So, what does a stealer log look like?

Is it legit? Whilst I won&apos;t test a username and password pair on a service (that&apos;s way too far into the grey for my comfort), I regularly use enumeration vectors on websites to validate whether an account actually exists or not. For example, take that last entry for <a href=\"https://www.racedepartment.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">racedepartment.com</a>, head to the password reset feature and mash the keyboard to generate a (quasi) random alias @hotmail.com:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1512\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-1.png 1512w\"></figure><p>And now, with the actual Hotmail address from that last line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1844\" height=\"902\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-2.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-2.png 1844w\"></figure><p>The email address exists.</p><p>The VideoScribe service on line 9:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"948\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-3.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png 948w\"></figure><p>Exists.</p><p>And even the service on the very first line:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Inside the Massive Naz.API Credential Stuffing List\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1018\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-4.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/01/image-4.png 1018w\"></figure><p>From a verification perspective, this gives me a high degree of confidence in the legitimacy of the data. The question of how valid the accompanying passwords remain aside, time and time again the email addresses in the stealer logs checked out on the services they appeared alongside.</p><p>Another technique I regularly use for validation is to reach out to impacted HIBP subscribers and simply ask them: &quot;are you willing to help verify the legitimacy of a breach and if so, can you confirm if your data looks accurate?&quot; I usually get pretty prompt responses:</p><blockquote>Yes, it does. This is one of the old passwords I used for some online services.&#xA0;</blockquote><p>When I asked them to date when they might have last used that password, they believed it was was either 2020 or 2021.</p><p>And another whose details appears alongside a Webex URL:</p><blockquote>Yes, it does. but that was very old password and i used it for webex cuz i didnt care and didnt use good pass because of the fear of leaking</blockquote><p>And another:</p><blockquote>Yes these are passwords I have used in the past.</blockquote><p>Which got me wondering: is my own data in there? Yep, turns out it is and with a <em>very</em> old password I&apos;d genuinely used pre-2011 <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">when I rolled over to 1Password for all my things</a>. So that sucks, but it does help me put the incident in more context and draw an important conclusion: this corpus of data isn&apos;t <em>just </em>stealer logs, it also contains your classic credential stuffing username and password pairs too. In fact, the largest file in the collection is just that: 312 million rows of email addresses and passwords.</p><p>Speaking of passwords, given the significance of this data set we&apos;ve made sure to roll every single one of them into Pwned Passwords. Stef&#xE1;n&#xA0;has been working tirelessly the last couple of days to trawl through this massive corpus and get all the data in so that anyone hitting <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3?ref=troyhunt.com#PwnedPasswords\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the k-anonymity API</a> is already benefiting from those new passwords. And there&apos;s <em>a lot</em> of them: it&apos;s a rounding error off 100 million <em>unique</em> passwords that appeared 1.3 <em>billion</em> times across the corpus of data &#x1F632; Now, what does that tell you about the general public&apos;s password practices? To be fair, there are instances of duplicated rows, but there&apos;s also a massive prevalence of people using the same password across multiple difference services and completely different people using the same password (there are a finite set of dog names and years of birth out there...) And now more than ever, the impact of this service is absolutely <em>huge!</em></p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When we weren&apos;t looking, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\">@haveibeenpwned</a>&apos;s Pwned Passwords rocketed past 7 *billion* requests in a month &#x1F632; <a href=\"https://t.co/hVDxWp3oQG?ref=troyhunt.com\">pic.twitter.com/hVDxWp3oQG</a></p>&#x2014; Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1747250819605381276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\">January 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Pwned Passwords remains totally free and completely open source for both code and data so do please make use of it to the fullest extent possible. This is such an easy thing to implement, and it has a <em>profound</em> impact on credential stuffing attacks so if you&apos;re running any sort of online auth service and you&apos;re worried about the impact of Naz.API, this now completely kills any attack using that data. Password reuse remain rampant so attacks of this type prosper (<a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/23andme-confirms-data-beach-that-started-as-a-credential-stuffing-attack/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">23andMe&apos;s recent incident</a> comes immediately to mind), definitely get out in front of this one as early as you can.</p><p>So that&apos;s the story with the Naz.API data. All the email addresses are now in HIBP and searchable either individually or via domain and all those passwords are in Pwned Passwords. There are inevitably going to be queries along the lines of &quot;can you show me the actual password&quot; or &quot;which website did my record appear against&quot; and as always, this just isn&apos;t information we store or return in queries. That said, if you&apos;re following the age-old guidance of using a password manager, creating strong and unique ones and turning 2FA on for all your things, this incident should be a non-event. If you&apos;re not and you find yourself in this data, maybe this is the prompt you finally needed to go ahead and do those things right now &#x1F642;</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> A few clarifications based on comments:</p><ol><li>The blog post refers to both stealer logs and classic credential stuffing lists. Some of this data does not come from malware and has been around for a significant period of time. My own email address, for example, accompanied a password not used for well over a decade and did not accompany a website indicating it was sourced from malware.</li><li>If you&apos;re in this corpus of data and are not sure which password was compromised, <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/finding-pwned-passwords-with-1password/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1Password can automatically (and anonymously) scan all your passwords against Pwned Passwords</a> which includes all passwords from this corpus of data.</li><li>It&apos;s already in the last para of the blog post but given how many comments have asked the question: no, we don&apos;t store any data beyond the email addresses in the breach. This means we don&apos;t store any additional data from the breach such as if a specific website was listed next to a given address.</li></ol>"}},{"title":{"#cdata-section":"Weekly Update 382"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Geez it&apos;s nice to be back in Oslo!

And now, a 10th birthday blog post about what really sticks out a decade later. And that&apos;s precisely what this 185th blog post tagging HIBP is - the noteworthy things of the years past, including a few things I&apos;ve never discussed publicly before.</p><h3 id=\"pwned\">Pwned?</h3><p>You know why it&apos;s called &quot;Have I Been Pwned&quot;? Try coming up with almost any conceivable <em>normal </em>sounding English name and getting a .com domain for it. <em>Good luck!</em> That was certainly part of it, but another part of the name choice was simply that I honestly didn&apos;t expect this thing to go anywhere. It&apos;s like I said in the intro of this post where I fully expected this to be another failed project, so why does the name matter?</p><p>But it&apos;s weird how &quot;pwned&quot; has stuck and increasingly, become synonymous with HIBP. For many people, the first time they ever hear the word is in the context of &quot;Have I Been...&quot; with an ensuing discussion often explaining the origins of the term as it relates to gaming culture. And if you do go and look for a definition of the term online, you&apos;ll come across resources such as <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/gaming/pwned-meaning-definition-origins-video-games-internet-hackers?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How &#x201C;PWNED&#x201D; went from hacker slang to the internet&#x2019;s favourite taunt</a>:</p><blockquote>Then in 2013, when various web services and sites saw an uptick in personal data breaches, security expert Troy Hunt created the website &#x201C;Have I Been Pwned?&#x201D; Anyone can type in an email address into the site to check if their personal data has been compromised in a security breach.</blockquote><p>And somehow, this little project is now referenced in the definition of the name it emerged from. Weird.</p><p>But, because it&apos;s such an odd name that has so frequently been mispronounced or mistyped, I&apos;ve ended up with a whole raft of bizarre domain names including <a href=\"http://haveibeenpaened.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenpaened.com</a>, <a href=\"http://haveibeenpwnded.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenpwnded.com</a>,  <a href=\"http://haveibeenporned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenporned.com</a> and my personal favourite, <a href=\"http://haveibeenprawned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenprawned.com</a> (because a journo literally pronounced it that way in a major news segment &#x1F926;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;). Not to mention all the other weird variations including <a href=\"http://haveibeenburned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenburned.com</a>, <a href=\"http://haveigotpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveigotpwned.com</a>, <a href=\"http://haveibeenrekt.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenrekt.com</a> and after someone made the suggestion following the revelation that PornHub follows me, <a href=\"http://haveibeenfucked.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">haveibeenfucked.com</a> &#x1F937;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p><h3 id=\"press\">Press</h3><p>It&apos;s difficult to even know where to start here. How does the little site with the weird name end up in the press? Inevitably, &quot;because data breaches&quot;, and it&apos;s <em>nuts</em> just how much exposure this project has had because of them. These are often mainstream news events and what reporters often want to impart to people is along the lines of &quot;Here&apos;s what you should do if you&apos;ve been impacted&quot;, which often boils down to checking HIBP.</p><p>Press is great for raising awareness of the project, but it has also quite literally DDoS&apos;d the service with <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/brief-lessons-on-handling-huge-traffic-spikes/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Martin Lewis Money Show in the UK  knocking it offline in 2016</a>. Cool! No, for real, I learned some really valuable lessons from that experience which, of course, I shared in a blog post. And then ensured could never happen again.</p><p>Back in 2018, Gizmodo reckoned HIBP was <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/100-websites-that-shaped-the-internet-as-we-know-it-1829634771?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one of the top 100 websites that shaped the internet as we knew it</a>, alongside the likes of Wikipedia, Google, Amazon and Goatse (don&apos;t Google it). Only the year after it launched, <a href=\"https://time.com/3054279/50-best-websites-2014/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TIME magazine reckon&apos;d it was one of the 50 best websites of the year</a>.

For the most part, I was as transparent and honest as I could be about the reasons behind the decision, including the stress:</p><blockquote>To be completely honest, it&apos;s been an enormously stressful year dealing with it all.</blockquote><p>More than one year later, <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/sustaining-performance-under-extreme-stress/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I finally wrote about the source of so much of that stress</a>: divorce. Relationship circumstances had put a huge amount of pressure on me and I needed a relief valve which at the time, I thought would be the sale of the project I loved so much but was becoming increasingly demanding. Ultimately, Project Svalbard (the code name for the sale of HIBP), had the opposite effect as years of bitter legal battles with my ex ensued, in part due to the perceived value that would have been realised had it been sold and some big tech company owned my arse for years to come. The project I built out of a passion to do community good was now being used as a tool to extract as much money out of me as possible. There&apos;s a wild story to be told there one day but whilst that saga is now well and truly behind me, the scars are still raw.</p><p>There were many times throughout Project Svalbard where I felt like I was living out an episode of Silicon Valley, especially as I hopped between interviews at the who&apos;s-who of tech firms in San Francisco to meet potential acquirers. But there was one moment in particular that I knew at the time would form an indelible memory, so I took a photo of it:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A Decade of Have I Been Pwned\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I&apos;m sitting in a rental car in Yosemite whilst driving from the aforementioned meetings in SF and onto Vegas for the annual big cyber-events. I had a scheduled call with a big tech firm who was a potential acquirer and should that deal go through, the guy I was speaking to would be my new boss. I&apos;d done that dozens of times by now and I don&apos;t know if it was because I was especially tired or emotional or if there was something in the way he phrased the question, but this triggered something deep inside me:</p><blockquote>So Troy, what would your perfect day in the office look like?</blockquote><p>I didn&apos;t say it this directly, but I kid you not this is exactly what popped into my mind:</p><blockquote>I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want</blockquote><p>My potential new overlord had somehow managed to find exactly the raw nerve to touch that made me realise how valuable independence had become to me. 6 months later, Project Svalbard was dead after a deal I&apos;d struck fell through. I still can&apos;t talk about the precise circumstances due to being NDA&apos;d up to wazoo, but the term we chose to use was &quot;a change of business circumstances on behalf of the purchaser&quot;.

And I never envisioned a time where dozens of national governments would be happy to talk about using the service.</p><p>A couple of months ago, the ABC wrote a long piece on how this whole thing is, to use their term, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-23/cybersecurity-troy-hunt-have-i-been-pwned-fighting-data-breaches/102803748?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a strange sign of the times</a>.</p><blockquote>He&#x2019;s just &#x201C;a dude on the web&#x201D;, but Troy Hunt&#xA0;has ended up playing&#xA0;an oddly central role in&#xA0;global&#xA0;cybersecurity.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A Decade of Have I Been Pwned\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 2150w\"></figure><p>It&apos;s strange until you look at through the lens of aligned objectives: the whole idea of HIBP was &quot;to do good things after bad things happen&quot; which is well aligned with the mandates of law enforcement agencies. You could call it... common ground:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<iframe src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7107432281870319616\" height=\"1066\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen title=\"Embedded post\"></iframe>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>This is something I suspect a lot of people don&apos;t understand - that law enforcement agencies often work in conjunction with private enterprise to further their goals of protecting people just like you and me. It&apos;s something I certainly didn&apos;t understand 10 years ago, and I still remember the initial surprise when agencies started reaching out. Many years on, these have become really productive relationships with a bunch of top notch people, a number of whom I now count as friends and make an effort to spend time with on my travels.</p><h3 id=\"passwords\">Passwords</h3><p>This was never on the cards originally. In fact, I&apos;d always been adamant that there should never be passwords in HIBP although in my defence, the sentiment was that they should never appear <em>next to the username</em> to which they originally accompanied. But looking at passwords through the lens of how breach data can be used to do good things, a list of known compromised passwords disassociated from any form of PII made a lot of sense. So, in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pwned Passwords was born</a>. You know what I was saying earlier about things escalating quickly? Yeah:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Setting all new records for Pwned Passwords this week: biggest day ever yesterday at 282M requests and biggest rolling 30 days ever, now passing the 6 *billion* requests mark! <a href=\"https://t.co/dQiuQim3da?ref=troyhunt.com\">pic.twitter.com/dQiuQim3da</a></p>&#x2014; Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1701473422335692997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>As if to make the point, I just checked the latest stats and last week we did 301.6M requests in a single day. 100% of those requests - and that&apos;s not a rounded number either, it&apos;s 100.0000000000% - were served from Cloudflare&apos;s cache &#x1F92F;</p><p>There&apos;s so much I love about this service. I love that it&apos;s free, there&apos;s no auth, it&apos;s entirely open source (both code and data), the FBI feeds data into it and perhaps most importantly, it has <em>real</em> impact on security. It&apos;s such a simple thing, but every time you see a headline such as &quot;Big online website hit with credential stuffing attack&quot;, a significant portion of the accounts being taken over have passwords that could easily have been blocked.</p><h3 id=\"the-paradox-of-handling-data-breaches\">The Paradox of Handling Data Breaches</h3><p>On multiple occasions now, I&apos;ve had conversations that can best be paraphrased as follows:</p><p><strong>Random Internet Person:</strong> I&apos;m going to report you to the FBI for having all that stolen data</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Maybe you should start by Googling &quot;troy hunt fbi&quot; first...</p><p>But I understand where they&apos;re coming from and the paradox I refer to is the perceived conflict between handling what is usually the output of a crime whilst simultaneously trying to perform a community good. It&apos;s the same discussion I&apos;ve often had with people citing privacy laws in their corner of the world (often the EU and GDPR) as the reason why HIBP shouldn&apos;t exist: &quot;but you&apos;re processing data without informed consent!&quot;, they&apos;ll claim. The issue of there being other legal bases for processing aside, <em>nobody</em> consents to being in a data breach! The natural progression of that conversation is that being in a data breach is a parallel discussion to HIBP then indexing it and making it searchable, <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">which is something I&apos;ve devoted many words to addressing in the past</a>.</p><p>But for all the bluster the occasional random internet person can have (and honestly, I could count the number of annual instances of this on one hand), nothing has come of any complaints. And when I say &quot;complaints&quot;, it&apos;s often nothing more than a polite conversation which may simply conclude with an acknowledgment of opposing views and that&apos;s it. There has been <em>one</em> exception in the entire decade of running this service where a complaint did come via a government privacy regulator, I responded to all the questions that were asked and that was the end of it.</p><h3 id=\"people\">People</h3><p>When you have a pet project like HIBP was in the beginning, it&apos;s usually just you putting in the hours. That&apos;s fine, it&apos;s a hobby and you&apos;re scratching an itch, so what does it matter that there&apos;s nobody else involved? Like many similar passion projects, HIBP consumed a lot of hours from early on, everything from obviously building the service then sourcing data breaches, verifying and disclosing them, writing up descriptions and even editing every single one of those 700+ logos by hand to be just the right dimensions and file size. But in the beginning, if I&apos;d just stopped one day, what would happen? Nothing. But today, a genuinely important part of the internet that a huge number of individuals, corporations and governments have built dependencies on would stop working if I lost interest.</p><p>The dependency on just me was partly behind the possible sale in 2019, but clearly that didn&apos;t eventuate. There was always the option to employ people and build it out like most people would a normal company, but every time I gave that consideration it just didn&apos;t stack up for a whole bunch of reasons. It was certainly feasible from the perspective of building some sort of valuable commercial entity, but in just the same way as that question about my perfect day in the office sucked the soul from my body, so did the prospect of being responsible for other people. Employment contracts. Salary negotiations. Performance reviews. Sick leave and annual leave and all sorts of other people issues from strangers I&apos;d need to entrust with &quot;my baby&quot;. So, bringing in more people was a really unattractive idea, with 2 exceptions:</p><p>In early 2021, my (soon to be at the time) wife Charlotte started working for HIBP.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/CharlotteHunt.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A Decade of Have I Been Pwned\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"284\"></figure><p>Charlotte had spent the last 8 years working with people just like me; software nerds. As a project manager for the NDC conferences based out of Norway, she&apos;d dealt with hundreds of speakers (including me on many occasions), and thousands of attendees at the best conference I&apos;ve ever been a part of. Plus, she spent a great deal of time coordinating sponsors, corporate attendees and all sorts of other folks that live in the tech world HIBP inhabited. For Charlotte, even though she&apos;s not a technical person (her qualifications are in PR and entrepreneurial studies), this was very familiar territory.</p><p>So, for the last few years, Charlotte has done absolutely everything that she can to ensure that I can focus on the things that need my attention. She onboards new corporate subscribers, handles masses of tickets for API and domain subscribers and does all the accounting and tax work. And she does this tirelessly every single day at all sorts of hours whether we&apos;re at home or travelling. She is... amazing &#x1F929;</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://stebet.net/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stef&#xE1;n J&#xF6;kull Sigur&#xF0;arson</a> started working for us part time writing code, cleaning up code, migrating code and, well, doing lots of different code things.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/Stef-nJ-kullSigur-arson.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A Decade of Have I Been Pwned\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"276\"></figure><p>Just today I asked Stef&#xE1;n&#xA0;what I should write about him, thinking he&apos;d give me some bullet points I&apos;d massage and then incorporate into this blog post. Instead, I reckon what he wrote was so spot on that I&apos;m just going to quote the entire thing here:</p><blockquote>&quot;Just&quot; that having had my eye on the service since it was released and then developing one of the first big integrations with the PwnedPasswords v2 API in EVE, coinciding with us meeting for the first time at NDC Oslo in 2018 shortly after,&#xA0; HIBP has managed to take me on this awesome journey where it has been a part of launching my public speaking career, contributing to OSS with Pwned Passwords, becoming an MVP and helped me meet a bunch of awesome people and allowed me to contribute to a better and hopefully safer internet. I&apos;m very happy and honoured to a be a part of this project which is full of awesome challenges and interesting problems to deal with. Having meeting invites from the FBI in my inbox a few years after doing a few experimental rest calls to the Pwned Passwords API in early 2018 was definitely not something I was expecting &#x1F605;</blockquote><p>What really resonated with me in Stef&#xE1;n&apos;s message is that for him, this isn&apos;t just a job, it&apos;s a passion. His journey is my journey in that we freely devoted our time to do something we love and it led to many wonderful things, including MVP roles and speaking at &quot;Charlotte&apos;s&quot; conference, NDC. Stef&#xE1;n&#xA0;is based in Iceland, but we&apos;ve still had many opportunities to share beers together and establish a relationship that transcends merely writing code. I can&apos;t think of anyone better to do what he does today.</p><h2 id=\"breaches\">Breaches</h2><p>731 breaches later, here we are. So, what stands out? Just going off the top of my head here:</p><p><strong>Ashley Madison.</strong> Every knows the name so it needs no introduction, but that incident in 2015 had a major impact on HIBP in terms of use of the service, and also a major impact on me in terms of the engagements I had with impacted parties. My blog post on <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-ashley-madison-members-have/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here&#x2019;s what Ashley Madison members have told me</a> still feels harrowing to read.</p><p><strong>Collection #1.</strong> This is the one that really contributed to my stress levels in early 2019 and had a profound impact on my decision to look at selling the service. <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Read about where those 773M records came from</a> (still the largest breach in HIBP to date).</p><p><strong>Rosebutt.</strong> Don&apos;t make a joke about it, don&apos;t make a joke about it, don&apos;t... aw man, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160512105342/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/11/embarassing_data_breach/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">thanks The Register!</a> (link to an archive.org version as they seem to have thought better of their image choice later on...) The point is that even serious data breaches can have their moments of levity.</p><p><strong>Shit Express.</strong> Sometimes, you just need a bit of hilarity in your data breach. Shit Express is literally a site to send other people pieces of that - <em>anonymously </em>- <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/anonymous-poop-gifting-site-hacked-customers-exposed/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">and they got breached</a>, thus somewhat affecting their anonymity. The more serious point is that as I later wrote, <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/safe-secure-anonymous-and-other-misleading-claims/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">claims of anonymity are often highly misleading</a>.</p><h2 id=\"future\">Future</h2><p>I often joke about my life being very much about getting up each morning, reading my emails and events from overnight and then just winging it from there. Of course there are the occasional scheduled things not to mention travel commitments, but for the most part it&apos;s very much just rolling with whatever is demanding attention on the day. This is also probably a significant part of why I don&apos;t really want to see this thing grow into a larger concern with more responsibilities, I just don&apos;t want to lose that freedom. Yet...</p><p>We&apos;re gradually moving in a direction where things become more formalised. 3 years ago, I did 100% of everything myself. 1 year ago, I did everything technical myself. 6 months ago, we had no ticketing system for support. But these are small, incremental steps forward and that&apos;s what I&apos;d like to see continuing. I want HIBP to outlive me, I just don&apos;t want it to become a burden I&apos;m beholden to in the process. I&apos;d like to have more people involved but as you can see from above, that&apos;s been a very slow process with only those very close to me playing a role.</p><p>The only thing I have real certainty on at the moment is that there will be more breaches. I&apos;ve commented many times recently that the scourge that is ransomware feels like it&apos;s really accelerated lately, I wonder how many of the people in the emails and documents and all sorts of other data that get dumped there ever learn of their exposure? It&apos;s a non-trivial exercise to index that (for all sorts of reasons), but it also seems like an increasingly worthy exercise. Who knows, let&apos;s see how I feel when I get up tomorrow morning &#x1F642;</p><p>Finally, for this week&apos;s regular video, I&apos;m going to make a birthday special and do it live with Charlotte. Please come and join us, I&apos;m not entirely sure what we&apos;ll cover (I&apos;ll work it out on the morning!) but let&apos;s make a virtual 10th birthday party out of it &#x1F382;</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6MHGUb5P7hE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n"}},{"title":{"#cdata-section":"Weekly Update 376"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>I&apos;m irrationally excited about the new Prusa 3D printer on order, and I think that&apos;s mostly to do with planning for the <a href=\"https://ndcoslo.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NDC Oslo</a> talk I plan to do with Elle, my 11-year old daughter.

So how many &quot;Acuity&quot; companies are out there in total?! Just in the course of investigating this data, I came across a total of 6 of them that as far as I can tell, are completely unrelated:</p><ol><li>Acuity Healthcare (definitely breached): <a href=\"https://acuity.healthcare/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuity.healthcare</a></li><li>Acuity Brands (definitely breached): <a href=\"https://www.acuitybrands.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuitybrands.com</a></li><li>Acuity Scheduling (maybe breached): <a href=\"https://www.acuityscheduling.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuityscheduling.com</a></li><li>Acuity Insurance: <a href=\"https://www.acuity.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuity.com</a></li><li>Acuity &quot;Innovative technical solutions for Federal agencies that support the National Security &amp; Public Safety missions&quot;: <a href=\"https://myacuity.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">myacuity.com</a></li><li>Acuity Ads: <a href=\"https://www.acuityads.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuityads.com</a> (now redirects to <a href=\"https://illumin.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">illumin.com</a>)</li></ol><p>Ugh, great. We&apos;ll work through them and try to figure out where they fit into the picture in a moment, but first let&apos;s look at the actual data. We already know it&apos;s 437GB, but it&apos;s the breadth of column headings that&apos;s most stunning; here&apos;s all 414 of them:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<style>\n.gist-data{\n    height:300px;\n    overflow-y: visible;\n}\n</style>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/troyhunt/74c150d9f02380df3de8fcaf03bc78c0.js\"></script>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Just by eyeballing these, it really doesn&apos;t feel like the sort of data that comes from a healthcare provider, a brands company or a scheduler. The other 3, however... Maybe.</p><p>Some more data points before going further:</p><ol><li>The files is named &quot;ACUITY_MASTER_18062020.csv&quot; (this is the date I&apos;ve elected to stamp the breach with - 18 June 2020)</li><li>There are 21,873,706 email addresses in the file</li><li>Of those, &quot;only&quot; 14,055,729 are unique so there&apos;s some redundancy</li><li>The data is cleansed and formatted in a fashion that definitely isn&apos;t reflective of how data is entered by end users</li></ol><p>On that final point, here&apos;s an example of what I&apos;m talking about:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who? Attempts and Failures to Attribute 437GB of Breached Data\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"166\" height=\"730\"></figure><p>The last names are the same, as are the salutations. The physical addresses are spot on accurate in their structure as are the phone numbers; there are no spaces, no dashes and no other artifacts typical of millions of different humans entering data. This is clean - <em>too</em> clean.</p><p>The &quot;datasource&quot; field is another interesting data point with the top 10 values being:</p><ol><li>Buy.com</li><li>Popularliving.com</li><li>studentsreview.com</li><li>TAGGED.COM</li><li>jamster.com</li><li>Expedia.com</li><li>cbsmarketwatch.com</li><li>netflix.com</li><li>selfwealthsystem.com</li><li>gocollegedegree.com</li></ol><p>Each of these entries appeared at least hundreds of thousands of times, if not millions. Does that mean that Netflix, for example, provided customer data to this list? Almost certainly no, but it does feel reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/data-breach-misattribution-acxiom-live-ramp/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Acxiom / Live Ramp misattribution post I wrote a year ago</a> where I listed full counts of a similar column. One of the top values there was also &quot;TAGGED.COM&quot; (also all in uppercase), alongside several other values that also appeared in both sources.</p><p>Back to attribution and a post on a popular hacking forum jumps out:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who?

The attribution is to the insurance company named &quot;Acuity&quot;, but is that accurate? Insurance companies collect a lot of data as it&apos;s relevant to how they run their business, but that data is <em>highly</em> unlikely to include fields such as:</p><ol><li>SpectatorSportsBasketball</li><li>SewingKnittingNeedlework</li><li>PresenceOfUpscaleRetailCard</li></ol>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<p>That&apos;s much more in the &quot;data enrichment&quot;  space where a company sells a massive data set so that it can expand the profile data of the purchaser&apos;s existing customer base.

And the column names line up! And it&apos;s called Acuity! Slightly different column count to mine (and similar but different to the hacker forum post), and slightly different email count, but the similarities remain striking. How I got to this resource is also interesting, having come by someone I was discussing the data with a couple of years ago:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who?

Could that indicate the data as coming from Acuity <em>Ads</em> (now <a href=\"https://illumin.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Illumin</a>)? No, not in and of itself, the walkthrough there isn&apos;t that dissimilar to other campaign tools I&apos;ve used in the past. No matter how much I looked, I just couldn&apos;t find a solid lead back to Acuity Ads and anything even remotely related was merely circumstantial. It <em>could</em> be from them, but it could also be from many other places and the mere fact that a near identical corpus of data was sitting there on an outright spam site only makes the whole mystery that much deeper. There was just one more interesting data point in that email:</p><blockquote>i myself am in that dataset and i&apos;ve been getting 100x more phishing/scam calls, emails, and physical mail</blockquote><p>Let me end this with a best guess: this feels like the same situation as <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/questions-about-the-massive-south-african-master-deeds-data-breach-answered/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the massive Master Deeds incident in South Africa in 2017</a>. In that case, a legally operating data aggregator (I think you know how I feel about those by now...) sold personal information to a real estate business who then left it publicly exposed. I say it <em>feels </em>the same because it&apos;s just such a clean set of data and it&apos;s clearly <em>very</em> comprehensive in terms of the columns. It&apos;s exactly what I&apos;d expect a data aggregator to prepare and sell to other businesses so they could identify which of their existing customers likes needlework.</p><p>In the past, publishing blog posts like this has helped identify an origin service and if that happens again here then I&apos;ll be sure to provide an update. For now, I&apos;ve loaded it into HIBP and flagged it as a <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs?ref=troyhunt.com#SpamList\" rel=\"noreferrer\">spam list</a> which means it won&apos;t impact the size of anyone&apos;s domains and bump them into a different subscription level. If you do have any interesting insights on this data, please leave a comment below and with any luck, one of the Acuity entities out there will emerge as the source.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> just after loading the data, I ran the calcs on how many of the addresses were pre-existing in HIBP. This seems like a statistically significant number &#x1F632;</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, 100% (just under actually, but it rounded up).
