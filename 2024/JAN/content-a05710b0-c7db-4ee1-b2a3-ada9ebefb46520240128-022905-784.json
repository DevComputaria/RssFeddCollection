CISA’s community-driven working groups publish documents and reports to advance and refine SBOM and ultimately promote adoption. Specifically, software producers often need to assemble and test products together before releasing them to customers. These products may contain components that experience version changes over time, therefore creating a need to be tracked. This document serves as a guide for creating the build for SBOM assembled products.  </p>\n<p>For more information on all things <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sbom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SBOM</a>, please visit CISA’s Software Bill of Materials website. </p>\n","pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 24 12:00:00 +0000\n","dc:creator":"CISA","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/node/20802"}},{"title":"CISA Releases Two Industrial Control Systems Advisories","link":"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/01/25/cisa-releases-two-industrial-control-systems-advisories","description":"<p>CISA released two Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories on January 25, 2024.
