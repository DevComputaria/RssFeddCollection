Just as organizations perform functional, integration and performance testing in the software development lifecycle, they must thoroughly assess mobile app security and privacy vulnerabilities and fix them prior to release. Like the typical web app security testing stack, the common <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile app security testing</a> stack includes four key tools: SAST, DAST, SCA and mobile security training. (Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">web and mobile security similarities and differences</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jan-10-MAST-blog-graphic-960x912.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-22173\" style=\"width:1057px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jan-10-MAST-blog-graphic-960x912.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jan-10-MAST-blog-graphic-360x342.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jan-10-MAST-blog-graphic-768x730.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jan-10-MAST-blog-graphic.png 1201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static Application Security Testing (SAST):</strong> SAST analyzes code statically (either source code or compiled binary code) to identify potential security vulnerabilities, like misuse of APIs, hardcoded credentials or improper error handling. It helps detect and fix security flaws early in the dev process, reducing later remediation costs. SAST has the benefit of being able to run early in the dev process but often generates high false positives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</strong>: DAST tests run mobile apps from the outside to surface vulnerabilities such as authentication issues and data leakage. It&#8217;s crucial for identifying security weaknesses that are not apparent in static code analysis. DAST has the benefit of fuller coverage of running code, but requires an automation engine to drive the mobile app.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Software Composition Analysis (SCA):</strong> SCA examines an app&#8217;s open-source components to identify known vulnerabilities and outdated libraries. This method ensures the security of open-source elements integrated into the mobile app, preventing common issues such as insecure LocalAuthentication configuration, outdated libpng libraries or known vulnerable versions of dependent SSL libraries.<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mobile Security Training: </strong>Training upskills developers and security teams on secure coding techniques and educates them about how to avoid or identify common coding mistakes. Proactive security training helps ensure higher quality as the code is written. In addition, just-in-time security training included with issue tickets helps dev learn how to fix the issue quickly and prevent them from making the same mistake again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive technology approach not only detects and mitigates potential vulnerabilities at every stage of the SDLC, but also protects the mobile app against emerging threats. The modern mobile app security testing stack is not simply a technical necessity, but acts as a fundamental <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/mobiledigitaltransexec?x=LIaYZt&amp;xs=278443#page=1\">digital transformation</a> aspect of building user trust, safeguarding the business and maintaining the integrity and resilience of mobile apps in our global economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tA comprehensive technology approach not only detects and mitigates potential vulnerabilities at every stage of the SDLC, but also protects the mobile app against emerging threats.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Old World vs. New World Approach</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the traditional landscape of desktop and web application security and now even mobile application security, leaders often took a patchwork approach to solution adoption by combining free open-source tools with commercial tools acquired incrementally. While initially cost effective, this strategy usually resulted in a complex mesh of technologies that each required deployment, training and integration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security managers have long grappled with the challenges piecemeal adoption presents, such as compatibility issues, inconsistent data formats and straddling the delicate balance between overlapping functionalities and unaddressed security gaps. As the toolset expands, so do the expenses and intricacies, particularly when addressing problems like data synchronization failures or the burden of system updates and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although individual solutions may demonstrate ROI sooner, the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a patchwork approach often rises more quickly. In some cases, certain tools prove incompatible with established workflows, leading to underutilization or outright abandonment by frustrated teams. This fragmented security tooling strategy not only taxes budgets but also threatens the overall efficacy of application security and the performance of security teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new world today increasingly adopts comprehensive, all-in-one solutions like <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a>.

For Android apps published on Google Play, developers must state how they collect, handle and protect user data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Apple rolled out App Tracking Transparency (ATT) several years ago to empower users to choose whether an app has permission to track their activity. Along with this, Apple introduced Privacy Nutrition Labels that communicate how apps collect and use data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a particular challenge when accurately reporting privacy information is that mobile applications rely heavily on third-party components, including software development kits (SDKs), open-source frameworks and libraries. As such, both Google and Apple require privacy disclosures to include the data collected by any third-party SDKs the mobile app uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tTo fulfill the new Apple Privacy Manifest requirements, developers must gather multiple data elements across their code and systems.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Apple Privacy Manifests for Mobile Apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its effort to address challenges in obtaining information from third-party SDKs, Apple introduced Privacy Manifests at this year&#8217;s developer conference (WWDC 2023). The Privacy Manifest lists the types of data an application or a third-party SDK collects about a user and the reasons for collecting this data. Apple has indicated that having a report aggregating all the privacy manifests for the mobile app&#8217;s first-party code and any SDKs used in the app will become a mandatory part of the Apple App Store review process in Spring 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improved <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/privacy-by-design?x=LIaYZt&amp;_gl=1*1dziaqr*_ga*MTU3ODc5NDE3MS4xNjc1OTU3MzY0*_ga_TJ8H8840QM*MTcwMTIwOTU5OC42OTIuMS4xNzAxMjA5NjIxLjM3LjAuMA..\">data privacy and security</a> are of the utmost importance for organizations, but they struggle to meet evolving compliance requirements. IDC&#8217;s 2023 DevSecOps Adoption, Techniques, and Tools Survey, respondents indicated <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/mobile-devsecops-security-testing-pitfalls-infographic?x=9z-j5n\">safeguarding user data</a> was one of the top two <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security </a>challenges. Additionally, 19% of respondents stated compliance with data privacy regulations was challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, complying with evolving mobile app privacy disclosure requirements create an added burden for mobile app developers to maintain mobile apps&#8217; privacy, security and integrity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fulfill the new <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/11/15/decoding-apple-privacy-manifests-for-ios-developers/\">Apple Privacy Manifest requirements</a>, developers must gather multiple data elements across their code and systems. As such, developers will need to understand data flows, dependencies and more. Apple&#8217;s XCode IDE provides some assistance, but the largely manual process can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate Privacy Manifest that ultimately could get the app rejected from the Apple App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While developers focus on <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/nowsecure-softwareve?x=uiz62K&amp;pflpid=10536\">building innovative mobile apps</a> that delight their users and support their business, they must properly handle data and respect privacy. <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/\">New tools</a> are emerging to assist developers on their journey. These tools can help developers better understand the flow and usage of sensitive private data in their mobile apps as they build them and readily generate documentation like the Apple Privacy Manifest efficiently and reliably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sponsored by NowSecure</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/12/06/idc-finds-mobile-data-privacy-security-are-critical-but-developers-need-new-tools-to-comply/\">IDC Finds Mobile Data Privacy &amp; Security Are Critical, but Developers Need New Tools to Comply</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com\">NowSecure</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Hacking Experts Discuss Emerging Cyberthreats","link":"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/11/29/hacking-experts-discuss-emerging-cyberthreats/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Ola Alibaloye"},"pubDate":"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 12:30:00 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Industry News"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.nowsecure.com/?p=21983"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>One NowSecure Connect mobile app security testing and mobile DevSecOps virtual conference tradition is our Hack to the Future panel, where we discuss the issues and challenges at the top of hackers’ minds.

The answers might surprise you!&nbsp; The stereotype of the always-on hacker hunched 24/7 over a computer keyboard —and the frequent expectation that security professionals should spend a sizable chunk of their free time growing their skillset —has led to the assumption that hackers prefer hacking to any other pursuit. But the art of hacking requires qualities like creativity, curiosity and empathy that need to be nurtured and exercised. Our panelists offered some of the ways that they combat burnout and simultaneously foster the very things that make them great hackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I actually experienced burnout during COVID, so something that I implemented was vacations,” said Jackson. “For me, taking vacations and literally turning off the computer and walking away has really helped a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin took up gardening and gave herself the grace to take what she calls ‘do nothing days.’ “I will sit there and watch absolutely bad TV, put my phone on do not disturb and give myself the ability to take a break,” she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Paxton-Fear enjoys knitting, crocheting, sewing and digital art. “My partner has described me as bursting with creative energy, and that really, really helps to do something outside of the computer and hacking,” she said. “It really does give me time to decompress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tPeople should treat AI like their family member who talks too much.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n        <cite>&#8211; Jasmine Jackson, Founder, The Accelerated Training Program (T-ATP)</cite>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Calls for Caution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity and connection were top of mind as the conversation turned to the first annual <a href=\"https://squadcon.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SquadCon</a> in Las Vegas and the prevalence of talks discussing the impact of AI. Technologies driven by <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/08/23/key-security-considerations-for-ai-coding-assistants-in-mobile-devsecops/\">generative AI</a> such as chatbots and image generators have exploded into the mainstream far faster than anyone expected. Yet while the average internet user is likely familiar with these tools, far more uses of AI already operate largely unseen.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As companies race to leverage AI to gain efficiency, grow market share, and innovate on complex problems, how can hackers contribute? Despite our concerns, the most important first step is using the tools and technology ourselves to gain the perspective and understanding required to dissect the potential risks. In many respects, our approach to securing AI won’t be that different from securing any new technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our panelists raised concrete concerns about the rapid pace of AI integration — including mitigating bias in datasets, protecting user privacy and preventing the further marginalization of underrepresented communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin shared concerns about AI facial detection capabilities being used for job interviews, for example. “If you can&#8217;t necessarily see my face appropriately because [AI] has a hard time with Black women, what is that saying about my job prospects?,” she asked “That makes me 30% less likely to get the job.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Like every other piece of technology that we’ve ever invented, we’re going to bolt on security and privacy and diversity inclusion issues without considering how that might fit together,” said Paxton-Fear. “In a way, I’m disappointed but not surprised.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jackson hasn’t explored ChatGPT too much other than managing to break it by putting it into an infinite loop, nor is she eager to embrace the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, there was broad agreement that the security community must find a way to counsel about the risks of AI without being alarmist. “People should treat AI like their family member who talks too much,” advised Jackson. “Don’t tell them anything that you don’t want someone else to know.”</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_50053d2c462d4b82c28511aeffa1bf73\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"featured-image-holder js-featured-image-holder\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle='background-image: url(\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-55.png\")'\n\t\t\t\t></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://info.nowsecure.com/2023-TechTalk-Webinar-Series.html?\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTech Talks- <strong>Meet the Experts</strong>\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-left justify-content-start\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://info.nowsecure.com/2023-TechTalk-Webinar-Series.html?' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Learn more</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automakers Drive Data Collection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our discussion wrapped up with a detour into automotive privacy inspired by the Mozilla Foundation’s Privacy Not Included blog.

She asked what kind of information the automotive manufacturers gain access to when people add car mobile apps to their smartphones, such as your contacts list or emails, as well as the fact that many of them sell that data. Paxton-Fear quipped, “I’ve never been so glad that I live in the UK and we have <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-standards-compliance/\">GDPR</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hackers closed with some predictions about how the hacking community will need to evolve to keep up with current challenges and the explosion of new technologies in every area of our lives.

All mobile app developers will be required to submit a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy manifest</a> that details data collection practices and usages when they add or update an iOS app in App Store Connect, the platform used for publishing and tracking performance in the App Store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure Chief Technology Officer David Weinstein recently briefed the mobile app community about the evolution of Apple privacy practices at the <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/NSConnect23/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NowSecure Connect: Stranger Vulns 2</a> <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile app security testing </a>and mobile DevSecOps virtual conference. In the “<a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/NSConnect23/agenda/session/1174758\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy in Mobile: New Mandates &amp; NowSecure Innovations</a>” session available for replay, the NowSecure CTO explained the coming privacy changes and previewed a new solution that aids developers in verifying the security and privacy posture of all third-party components they use to build their mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weinstein reiterated that devs hold responsibility for all code in their iOS apps including first party-code they write and third-party code from SDKs and other tools per the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\">App Store Review Guidelines</a>. In addition, Apple forbids the use of fingerprinting on mobile apps. Read on to learn more about the requirements that you’ll need to comply with or risk the App Store blocking your app from being updated or accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Pillars</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple regards privacy as a fundamental human right and one of its core values. The company’s multi-layered approach to data privacy includes four principles that it uses when thinking about the privacy of Apple products and services. The four Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10053/?time=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy pillars</a> are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data minimization &#8211; Reduces amount of information collected&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On-device processing &#8211; Makes it so data doesn’t necessarily need to leave the device or be stored on the server</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transparency and control &#8211; Empowers users to make better decisions and remove access to data when necessary or desired&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security protections &#8211; protecting data in transit, on the file system or store it correctly in the keychain, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21962\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic.png 600w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic-360x480.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Nutrition Labels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Apple debuted <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy Nutrition Labels </a>to help users learn more about how mobile apps collect and use their data so they can make good choices. The labels cover three categories:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data Used to Track You</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data Linked to You</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data Not Linked to You</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"401\" height=\"835\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21963\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic.png 401w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic-360x750.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Dec. 8, 2020, Apple began requiring developers to complete the data collection disclosures for mobile apps upon submitting them to the App Store. While this information provides much-needed transparency, it’s entirely self reported by developers and based on the honor system. That means some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy Nutrition Labels may be inaccurate</a>, either due to bad intent by the mobile app maker or more likely, because iOS developers lack insight into the privacy practices of the many third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use to build their mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Apple privacy manifests aim to bridge that gap. While the Privacy Nutrition Labels help users decide which mobile apps to trust, privacy manifests provide useful information to mobile app developers about the privacy practices of their dependencies stemming from third-party SDKs. Because SDKs have major implications for mobile app privacy, privacy manifests will old developers more accountable for accurately representing third-party code they include in their builds in their Privacy Nutrition Labels.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tWe’ve been working on crafting tools that will help easily ensure the privacy and security of the application while minimizing App Store surprises.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n        <cite>&#8211; NowSecure CTO David Weinstein</cite>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Manifests</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A privacy manifest captures details about both first and third-party code in your mobile apps. In <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developer documentation</a>, Apple defines the privacy manifest as a “property list that records the types of data collected by your app or third-party SDK, and the required reason APIs your app or third-party SDK uses.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has prepared a list of iOS functionality that has the potential to impact privacy and be misused for fingerprinting. It calls these <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required reason APIs</a>. They include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>File timestamp APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>System boot time APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disk space APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Active keyboard APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User defaults APIs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the above categories, Apple lists approved reasons to access these APIs based on their use cases. For example, one required reason API is NSFileSystemFreeSize, which indicates the amount of free space on the file system. One approved reason allowing this use is to leverage this API to check whether there’s sufficient disk space before writing files to disk. But if your mobile app is a flashlight or calculator, for instance, it shouldn’t need access to disk space or active keyboard APIs according to <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/privacy-by-design?x=LIaYZt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy by design principles</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When developers incorporate any required reason APIs into their mobile apps, they must choose one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect their use of each of those APIs and the data derived from their use. To protect users from possible fingerprinting, Apple allows apps and SDKs to access the required reason APIs only for approved reasons. Developers declare this information as part of the process of completing  privacy manifest files in Xcode. If your mobile app uses a required reason API to benefit users for a reason that Apple doesn’t list, you can submit a request for a new approved reason.</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_93b1510094ced7f75c045bb9afe8f7b5\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"featured-image-holder js-featured-image-holder\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle='background-image: url(\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphical-CTA-500x500-v2-500x400.png\")'\n\t\t\t\t></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy &amp; Security for Developers &#8211; NowSecure Observer\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-right justify-content-end\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Read More</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Store Enforcement Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will offer a grace period for developers to become familiar with the forthcoming privacy requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Beginning in<strong> fall 2023</strong>, Apple will email developers via when an app uses a privacy-impacting SDK without providing a privacy manifest or taps a required reason API without specifying a valid explanation in the privacy manifest. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting in <strong>spring 2024</strong>, the privacy manifest will become mandatory and Apple will begin enforcing that requirement as part of the app review process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-960x502.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21964\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-960x502.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-360x188.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-768x402.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To recap, mobile app developers should now prepare for the privacy changes that will arrive soon. “Reviewing Apple’s evolving privacy requirements, we can see that in 2020, Privacy Nutrition Labels were introduced,” said Weinstein. “At WWDC 23, privacy manifests were introduced. And finally in 2024, we can expect manifest enforcement as mentioned by Apple in its developer documentation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing NowSecure Observer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure sees the opportunity to aid iOS developers in complying with the new Apple privacy mandates. “We’ve been working on crafting tools that will help easily ensure the privacy and security of the application while minimizing App Store surprises,” Weinstein said. Providing greater visibility to sensitive data flows will empower devs to better meet privacy requirements while boosting <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/6-ways-secure-mobile-app-development-efficiency?x=LIaYZt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DevSecOps efficiency</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently available in beta, the <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/\">NowSecure Observer </a>developer tool simplifies mobile privacy and security during the coding stage. It provides real-time visibility into how sensitive data is being used, stored and transmitted by first- and third-party code. It also enables developers to quickly resolve security and privacy issues and avoid App Store surprises and rejections.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-960x617.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21965\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-960x617.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-360x231.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-768x494.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once developers add it to their iOS project, the NowSecure Observer SDK collects telemetry as the developer codes and at runtime. The SDK feeds information to the NowSecure Observer web app so you can see data flows, observe dependencies that have been introduced over time and generate Apple privacy manifests and mobile <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/08/24/4-things-you-can-do-with-a-mobile-sbom/\">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM</a>) reports.

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors in software systems and mobile apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Integrated Development Environments (IDE) come with built-in debugging tools that enable a developer to review the inner workings of your projects line by line, but occasionally these debuggers may not be able to achieve exactly what you want. Even worse, if you’re checking for bugs, reverse engineering, performing <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing</a> or analyzing performance on a mobile app for which you do not have the source code, debugging can quickly become a very daunting task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you lack access to an app’s source code, you can debug an app by conducting static or dynamic analysis. In this post, we will discuss how to leverage <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/frida/\">Frida</a> for manual dynamic analysis to understand the inner workings of an application.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/NSConnect23?promo=FridaNSBlogC23&amp;tr=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-960x502.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21855\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-960x502.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-360x188.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-768x402.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Frida?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frida is a free, open-source dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse engineers, and security researchers created and supported in part by NowSecure researchers. Frida can be used on a variety of different platforms, such as Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and embedded systems. The framework allows users to hook into the memory of running processes and view or manipulate the inner workings of the application. Frida hooks are typically written in <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Javascript</a>, though Frida provides bindings for multiple other <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/c-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leverage the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The large community of Frida enthusiasts generously provides tools and scripts utilizing Frida’s capabilities to assist developers and researchers around the world. You can find these tools in various places on the Internet, however, the official place to find premade Frida scripts is <a href=\"https://codeshare.frida.re/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frida CodeShare</a>. This section will touch on just a few of these helpful publicly accessible tools/scripts. We encourage you to search for more or even contribute your own creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To easily use scripts from the CodeShare, run Frida with the codeshare flag:<br><code>frida --codeshare &lt;author&gt;/&lt;the-script-name&gt; -f &lt;package-name&gt;</code><br><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using this on a device connected via USB, add the&nbsp;<code>-U</code>&nbsp;flag</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the script isn’t included on the CodeShare, you’ll need to save the script to a Javascript file and run it with the following command:<br><code>frida -l &lt;path-to-script&gt; -f &lt;package-name&gt;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tFrida is a very capable debugging tool that should have a place in every developer’s toolkit.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Class/Method Inspection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to see what classes or methods are being used while an application is running. You can use these Frida scripts to log any time a specific class or method is called. In addition, every argument that is used will also be displayed alongside the method’s return value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">iOS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For iOS, <a href=\"https://github.com/0xdea/frida-scripts/blob/master/raptor_frida_ios_trace.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this script</a> provides an easy way to hook Objective-C or native methods. To use it, pass the method declaration that you’re interested in as an argument to the trace function at the bottom of the script. For example, if you wanted to hook any classes that have a method name that ends with the word “Password”, you could use this:<br><code>*[* *Password:*]</code><br>If this syntax looks confusing, you may want to check out <a href=\"https://roadfiresoftware.com/2014/06/how-to-read-and-write-method-declarations-in-objective-c/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this explanation</a> of Objective-C method declarations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FUv8cXD055O_Q7DCPwQ8CdHbgfZSWDt4TZaN-cvHUgwWvwOBMvfTHGGepeEYpdbNUC5nTX_HYF1uLrWiMs1_W6iR04ihVby3IlW_YTr6TMcTyLhQxtIPEMUq7cANtwsaG_oIKH1hcf838WH8npyOSUc\"></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Android</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For Android, use <a href=\"https://github.com/iddoeldor/frida-snippets/blob/master/scripts/trace_class.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this script</a> to hook all Java methods for the provided class. This script is used by placing the full class name in the array at the bottom or by calling <code>traceClass()</code> directly. For example, if you wanted to hook all methods from the <code>SecretKeySpec</code> class, you could use this:<br><code>traceClass(“javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec”)</code></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q5x24i_JgCmrk2-XUS37PaVQ9tHSMAjA3h2Qf30rDZqjt81Yr76a8SV2a4oZUcNDyChz4E_Zu0FbnP1L4dhzIyKg4Ty1bD6Mldzl8U6GNoWbnjZpwk-8trhSKlGOQXtIwTcsVsHSXqpdHxxfjKrZf5I\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">View File Interactions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you may want to inspect what’s getting read from or written to disk. You can use this <a href=\"https://codeshare.frida.re/@FrenchYeti/android-file-system-access-hook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">File System Access script</a> to accomplish that. This script will display every file creation, open, read, and write that an Android app performs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mqhoJkcWcWtSXpH_W4zDc8ZRILcwkD8wwI-8y4jZZ5M2Z0WRFBuroNkb2SBW_nzLt322ksaMBMce5FgWKGUKWX_JJ7xIdZaiIax8E-IGEt_N99_METUrE9KTlRcrNg1RigG6HECKN2Wx1e8adow4ZpI\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dump Application Memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An application’s memory can contain all sorts of sensitive or useful information. The easy-to-use tool <a href=\"https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fridump</a> allows you to quickly dump app memory to disk for further analysis. You can use it with:<br><code>python3 fridump.py -U -o memory_dump &lt;app-name&gt;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Gt5Zpkel8Lhqm2CW2Tz0o7-anpQdJS5fVdM2aKcn_EVSYhSy5930K_wqkuwVeJWqYdo3lbVxzeR52eexCzan97nIuQgpEqu7p4dghN5yXkzHNIflsZNpC3a1RK1m17Tz9CybMPBpesWbbhicCsD9muw\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can search for passwords, API keys, unobfuscated strings, debug symbols and other sensitive information by running <code>strings</code> on the output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trace Method Calls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">frida-trace</a> allows you to dynamically trace function calls by providing class/method names. frida-trace also allows for wildcards, so you can hook multiple calls at once without knowing the complete method names. For example, if you want to monitor the Java cryptographic libraries of an application, you could use:<br><code>frida-trace -U -f &lt;app-package-name&gt; -j '*crypto*!*/i'</code><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"624\" height=\"156\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dkDEmSDYUX3LO4K6PLC1os3DUR_903rctudity5uBCNRhos597yzlA603rsrpcjFumjyZbdaJPNP3VTykcjWo5vff4620w3ddcaQKNcJqVVlUfrCEAADvkWSQbLgv-qo_HP8sfRe8wbi7IxwUtbKjSw\"><br>In the above instance, there were 925 matches for methods that had crypto in the class name. Upon launching the app, it was determined that this app uses AES GCM. The trace also shows the IV that was used to initialize the cipher. From here, you could narrow down your tracing to only classes related to AES GCM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Writing Your Own Scripts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to using prebuilt tools and scripts, it can be helpful to know how to write a basic Frida script. Occasionally tools output too much information and it can be very time consuming to sift through. This section will discuss how to create a basic Frida script for Android using the <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Javascript API</a>. Other platforms may be slightly different, but the idea is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DIY Frida Script</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start writing your script, you must perform the following steps to ensure that you have all the necessary information.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the class and method name you are interested in.\n<ul>\n<li>This can be done by looking at the source code. If the source is not available, try running the app through a decompiler such as <a href=\"https://github.com/skylot/jadx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JADX-GUI</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Determine if this call is found in native code or not.\n<ul>\n<li>If the method is found in a shared object or dylib, then it is native.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Determine if the method has any overloads.\n<ul>\n<li>If there are overloads, take note of the type and total number of parameters that each overload accepts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-Native</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For this example, we will be inspecting the values that are passed into this login verification function:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1Vbcp0H2mFija2w0rkPiFXmelRo_QiDF8PZ8UkDguBoe60vL4dXs2b7udzCNddnnRC0DObAFmqer2JHI-7jtg1-MnWTNFL1HAZGLEugJX5Jp4GjOn4BhIwWx98TWZCpHFvCv9zsngrYNX6QfKlgbO2o\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we want to hook a Java method, we want to ensure that the JVM is loaded before we attempt to hook into the method’s functionality. This can be done by wrapping your hook in:<br><code>Java.perform(function(){})</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we need to assign a variable to the class that we want to hook:<br><code>const verifyLogin =&nbsp; Java.use(“com.insecureshop.util.Util”)</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, we need to hook into the implementation for the method (and overload) that we are interested in. Overload parameters are described by their corresponding Dalvik <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format#typedescriptor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TypeDescriptors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>Util[\"verifyUserNamePassword\"].overload(\"java.lang.String\", \"java.lang.String\").implementation = function (username, password){}</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we’ll overwrite the original functionality of the method. Remember that we must return the proper value from the custom implementation or the app may crash. A completed hook could look like this:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\nJava.perform(function(){\n  \tconst Util = Java.use(&quot;com.insecureshop.util.Util&quot;);\n \t Util&#x5B;&quot;verifyUserNamePassword&quot;].overload(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;, &quot;java.lang.String&quot;).implementation = function (username, password) {\n      \tconsole.log(`Util.verifyUserNamePassword is called: username=${username}, password=${password}`);\n     \t let result = this&#x5B;&quot;verifyUserNamePassword&quot;](username, password);\n      \tconsole.log(`Util.verifyUserNamePassword result=${result}`);\n      \treturn result;\n  \t};\n})\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Native</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Native code is hooked slightly differently than non-native code. Instead of generating a wrapper for the non-native class and overwriting the implementation, Interceptor is used to obtain the native method’s address in memory. In this example, we will be hooking the behavior of the C standard library <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">read</a> call. You can typically use official documentation to understand the parameters and return values of what you are hooking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we need to get the memory address of the method we want to hook. This can be done as follows:<br><code>Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'read');</code>Next, use Interceptor to attach to the memory address:<br><code>Interceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'read'),&nbsp;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>{</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onEnter(args) {},</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onLeave(retval) {}</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br></code>Now, use the <code>onEnter</code> and <code>onLeave</code> callbacks to print out the values of the arguments. If we wanted to print out the contents that were read from each file, the hook could look like this:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\nInterceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName(&#039;libc.so&#039;, &#039;read&#039;), {\n    onEnter(args) {\n      this.buffer = args&#x5B;1]\n    },\n    onLeave(retval) {\n      if (retval.toInt32() &gt; 0) {\n        console.log(`Read ${retval.toInt32()} byte(s)`);\n        const read = Memory.readByteArray(this.buffer, retval.toInt32());\n        console.log(read);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Notice how this is used to store the arguments to be used in the onLeave callback.
