Online marketing, shopping, gaming, making transactions, viewing news/sports, etc., have increased tremendously. You may have encountered times when sites slow down or hang up as an internet user. This usually happens due to heavy network traffic. Also, the reason could be too many images, and plugins which can be looked in to avoid slowing down. SSL Offloading can help you enhance the speed of the server. It is important that you don’t overlook security measures and take care of your website. It may happen that many people are not technical, hence, here, we will discuss SSL Offloading. Also, we are going to discuss its needs, its functioning, its pros and cons. What is SSL Offloading? An SSL offloading reduces the burden of web servers by removing the SSL-based encryption from incoming traffic. This means a separate device can handle the processing of decrypting and encrypting the traffic sent through SSL instead of the web server having to do it all. SSL offloading is designed for SSL acceleration or SSL termination. SSL offloading can help you boost the performance of your web servers and as a result, improve [&#8230;]"}},{"title":"UCC SSL Certificate: The Ideal Choice for Multiple Domain Security","link":"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/ucc-ssl-certificate-for-multiple-domain-security","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"afgnalngasan"},"pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 12:22:41 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"SSL University"},{"#cdata-section":"SSL Certificate"},{"#cdata-section":"UCC"},{"#cdata-section":"UCC SSL Certificate"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/?p=9416"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"A United Communication Certificate (UCC) is a Microsoft Exchange SSL Certificate. It is one of the types of SSL specially designed for Microsoft Exchange and office communication servers. In this article, we will learn about a UCC certificate and how it can secure 250 domains with a single certificate. Also, we will find out why you need it for your organization. What is a UCC SSL Certificate? A Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) is a type of SSL that can secure multiple domains and subdomains using the same certificate. UCC (Unified Communications Certificate) is a budget-friendly certificate because it helps secure many domains and the first level of subdomains with a single certificate. A UCC SSL certificate is also termed a Multi-Domain SSL certificate, or SAN certificate, and helps in protecting various sites present on varied servers. In short, a Multi-Domain SSL certificate secures all FQDN (fully qualified domain names) with only one certificate. UCC SSL can secure up to 250 domains. Of course, the upper cap on the count of domains that a UCC SSL certificate can secure solely depends on the Certificate Authority. Since multiple domains are involved in this certificate, the 1st domain comprises the primary/root domain, and the remaining [&#8230;]"}},{"title":"ECC or RSA – Which One You’d Choose for Web Security?","link":"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/blog/ecc-vs-rsa-which-is-better-choice-for-web-security","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"admin"},"pubDate":"Mon, 22 Jan 2024 09:34:01 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Cyber Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.cheapsslshop.com/?p=12819"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"ECC vs. RSA: Learn how to distinguish between the most popular encryption algorithms with the help of this guide.
