Our users will experience unparalleled scalability, reliability, and a suite of advanced features that redefine web application security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lets-dive-into-the-key-advantages-this-new-upgrade-offers\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let&#8217;s Dive Into the Key Advantages This New Upgrade Offers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Enhanced Scalability and Performance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new interface of Qualys WAS is engineered to handle a higher volume of concurrent users and requests seamlessly, ensuring uncompromised scalability, performance, and reliability, even under increased demand. This capability is crucial for businesses that experience varying levels of user activity, always providing a stable and responsive environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. High Availability and Fault Tolerance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the core of the new interface is a system that emphasizes resilience and fault tolerance by handling unforeseen issues swiftly, ensuring uninterrupted access and consistent service delivery. With automatic failover and recovery mechanisms, we made robustness an integral part in maintaining continuous operations, particularly in critical security environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Advanced Containerization &amp; Microservices Architecture</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption of a containerized microservices architecture marks a significant architectural improvement where each microservice is self-contained and responsible for specific functionalities. This enhancement reduces dependencies, minimizes the impact of changes on the overall system, improves flexibility, and streamlines updates and maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Optimized Infrastructure Load</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new WAS interface significantly reduces the load on shared infrastructure components like pps/papi, leading to enhanced overall performance and availability of the Qualys portal and helping all interconnected Qualys products and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Focused and Efficient Testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a more focused scope of testing, the new WAS interface ensures high-quality standards and minimizes regression areas. This streamlined testing process is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system, ensuring that each update meets higher quality standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Embracing Cutting-Edge Technologies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging the latest technologies like Spring Boot, Hibernate, Kubernetes, and the newest Java versions, the new interface of WAS is a testament to Qualys&#8217;s commitment to align with current industry best practices and innovate using modern, robust platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Consistent and Intuitive User Experience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring consistency is key for Qualys in reducing the learning curve for users and enhancing user satisfaction. The new interface follows the same design principles as other Qualys products, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Aligned with Modern DevOps Practices</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aligning with the common technologies and DevOps practices used in other Qualys products, the new WAS interface facilitates smoother integration and collaboration between different teams and products, enhancing operational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Enhanced Integration Capabilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new WAS seamlessly integrates with various shared services offered by Qualys, like Opensearch, Unified Dashboard, and Audit Log. This integration provides enhanced functionality and value, enriching the user experience and broadening the scope of security management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Improved Search Functionality</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing Opensearch, the new UI offers a powerful and flexible search engine. This feature enables users to find and filter information swiftly, significantly improving the efficiency of data management and analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Unified Dashboard Integration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integration with the Unified Dashboard provides a comprehensive and customizable view of the users&#8217; security posture across different Qualys products and modules. This holistic view is crucial in making informed security decisions and managing risks effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12. Expanded Platform Capabilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new UI&#8217;s API and interface exposure allow for easier integration with other Qualys products, expanding the platform&#8217;s scope and capabilities. This openness fosters a more integrated and versatile ecosystem, benefiting users with a more cohesive security management experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of the new UI for Qualys WAS marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Qualys WAS, offering our customers a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly experience. As we continue to push the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible, we invite you to join us in this exciting new chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"already-an-existing-user-you-have-90-days-for-a-seamless-transition\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Already an Existing User? You Have 90 Days for a Seamless Transition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For existing Qualys WAS users, the new UI offers a suite of benefits that streamline operations and enhance your overall security posture.

Legacy agent versions will continue to support the previous version of this feature in its most basic form, where only VM and PC Network Transmission can be disabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What happens to my current agents configured for legacy “Blackout Windows”?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no impact or change. For the following Cloud Agents, only the network transmission for VM and PC modules is blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cloud Agents for Windows before v5.4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cloud Agents for Linux before v6.2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cloud Agents installed on all other platforms</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does the new RAP Window feature allow me to control all Qualys module features on the agent?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Event-based modules including EDR, EPP, FIM and XDR are not included in this version of RAP Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does the new RAP Window feature allow me to completely subdue the Qualys Cloud Agent so that it does not operate at all?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. As some modules may still be operating, inherent core functionality that these modules may require, such as command-polling, is still running, however, these internal functions are very unobtrusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all scan-based and remediation-based modules are disabled, and no event-based modules are licensed for that endpoint, then there is almost no use of such internal functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enhanced-capabilities-for-vdi-streamlining-agent-provisioning-and-merging\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhanced Capabilities for VDI: Streamlining Agent Provisioning and Merging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enhanced Capabilities for VDI update to the Qualys Cloud Agent introduces a sophisticated logic improvement to address the unique challenges in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments, particularly in agent provisioning and merging, leading to efficient and secure VDI environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Set It and Forget It</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In VDI environments, where virtual desktops are routinely regenerated, managing cloud agents efficiently becomes crucial. Previously, each regeneration created new unique identifiers (UUIDs) for agents, leading to duplicates and unnecessary consumption of Cloud Agent licenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the first boot of a linked clone without a UUID triggers a search in the Asset and VMDR databases to check for previous instances based on metadata like hostname, IP address, and MAC address. If recognized, the agent&#8217;s metadata is updated under the new UUID, eliminating duplicates and conserving licenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a <em>&#8216;Set It and Forget It</em>&#8216; solution: once you define the recognition rules, the Qualys Cloud Platform does the rest, requiring no further configuration at the endpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Asset Identification Service</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our latest service enhancement, the Asset Identification Service, is a game-changer that adeptly merges newly provisioned agents with existing records using key asset attributes (MAC address, Hostname, NetBIOS name, serial number, etc.). This approach is equally effective for both persistent and non-persistent VDI assets, ensuring a unified, efficient record while preserving critical data like creation and initial discovery dates.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image q-image-no-shadow\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" data-attachment-id=\"34849\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/01/23/announcing-the-newest-game-changing-upgrades-of-qualys-cloud-agent/attachment/vdi\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI.png\" data-orig-size=\"1000,671\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"VDI\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI-300x201.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34849\" style=\"width:668px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI.png 1000w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI-300x201.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VDI-768x515.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Top of Form</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features of Enhanced VDI Capabilities</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved Agent Provisioning Logic</strong>: Merge agents based on primary (MAC addresses, BIOS serial numbers) and supporting fields (Hostname, IP address, OS).<ul><li><strong>Primary Fields for Precision</strong>: Merge agents using primary fields such as MAC addresses, BIOS serial numbers, or BIOS/hardware UUIDs that serve as the backbone of the merging process, ensuring accuracy and reliability.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supporting Fields for Flexibility</strong>: In addition to the primary fields, incorporate an additional layer with supporting fields like Hostname, IP address, and OS for enhanced flexibility, adapting the process to diverse IT environments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authoritative Decision Making</strong>: Ensures agent merging only occurs with an exact match of selected criteria.<ul><li><strong>Primary Field Priority</strong>: Agent merging decisively relies on primary fields. Rules for merging cannot be established based on supporting fields alone, emphasizing the importance of primary field selection.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exact Match Requirement</strong>: For a successful merge, there must be an exact match across all customer-selected criteria. This stringent matching process ensures that merging occurs only when all specified conditions are met, preventing inaccuracies and maintaining the integrity of your IT environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Smart Decision-Making with Multiple MAC Addresses</strong>: A smart, comprehensive solution for handling multiple MAC addresses in complex IT environments with multiple network interface controllers (NICs).<ul><li><strong>Smart Decision-Making in Multi-NIC Environments:</strong> Collects all MAC addresses in a comma-separated format, catering to environments with multiple NICs for accurate asset management and streamlined agent merging.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intelligent MAC Address Matching:</strong> The key to our efficient merging process lies in the intelligent matching of MAC addresses, irrespective of their sequence. For instance, if an existing asset is recorded with MAC addresses M1, M2, and M3, and a new agent is introduced with these MAC addresses in any order (e.g., M2, M1, M3), our system recognizes and merges the agent seamlessly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\" https://player.vimeo.com/video/905758357?h=46c23f69c4\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Enhanced VDI Capabilities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enhanced VDI Capabilities are not just an improvement – it&#8217;s a leap forward in VDI asset management, revolutionizing agent provisioning by eliminating duplicates, conserving Cloud Agent licenses, and ensuring seamless consolidation of assets in VDI environments.

execute against those assets or products. The patching job, once successful, will help you eliminate the risk posed by the critical and high QDS vulnerabilities. Once these patches are applied and vulnerabilities are fixed, this report will show the next top 50 patches that you should focus on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"proactive-and-reactive-patching\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proactive and Reactive Patching</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most organizations focus on automating patching processes and often want to patch the most common applications, like updates to browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, as soon as the vendors publish new versions. Such applications are easy to patch, and if they are deployed automatically, they rarely cause any operational problems. The “<strong>Patch Automation</strong>” report under the “Prioritized Products” tab shows the products with the highest vulnerabilities reported in your environment. This report helps in proactively creating zero-touch patch jobs, which can be aimed at automatically patching the applications that get the highest number of vulnerabilities without looking at the vulnerability scan reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1070\" height=\"579\" data-attachment-id=\"34804\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/01/22/reduce-risk-faster-with-the-qualys-risk-reduction-recommendation-report/attachment/image-3-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"3446,1864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Image-3-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-300x162.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-1070x579.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-1070x579.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34804\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-1070x579.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-300x162.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-768x415.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-1536x831.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-3-1-2048x1108.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1070\" height=\"541\" data-attachment-id=\"34826\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/01/22/reduce-risk-faster-with-the-qualys-risk-reduction-recommendation-report/attachment/image-4-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"2618,1324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Image-4-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-300x152.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-1070x541.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-1070x541.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34826\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-1070x541.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-300x152.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-768x388.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-1536x777.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Image-4-1-2048x1036.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another pivot to creating a zero-touch patch automation job is by looking at the VMDR prioritization report.

Similar to log4j, struts are open-source deep-embedded packages and not present in default location, thus, traditional vulnerability scanners have limitations in detecting the struts and vulnerabilities. Let&#8217;s explore the shortcomings of conventional approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Challenges of Traditional Methods:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Directory Dependency:</strong> Traditional vulnerability scanners often rely on standard directories to locate software vulnerabilities. This approach proves inadequate when software is installed in non-standard directories, as these tools may overlook potential vulnerabilities residing outside their predefined search paths.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Process-Driven Techniques:</strong> Implementing more sophisticated techniques, such as examining running processes using commands like &#8216;ps,&#8217; introduces its own set of limitations. If a vulnerable process is not active during the scanning period, the vulnerability remains undetected, leading to a false sense of security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>File System Search Constraints:</strong> Searching the file system using commands like &#8216;find&#8217; is another common method, but it comes with limitations. The scan is often bound by timeout constraints and maximum file depth, which hinders the detection of vulnerabilities deeply embedded in the file system. Consequently, packages residing in intricate directory structures may escape the scrutiny of traditional scanners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lack of Understanding of Risk</strong>: Customers are looking to know the risk of this vulnerability and not just report on hundreds of thousands of detections of Struts2 so that they can prioritize the ones present on critical assets, mapped to their critical applications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Upgrade Is Not Easy for the Business and Lacks Mitigation Guidance:</strong> While the concept of mitigating risk by upgrading the application version seems straightforward theoretically, the practicalities are more complex, especially if the application is integral to critical functions. It&#8217;s only sometimes feasible to upgrade the version promptly. Therefore, customers require effective interim risk mitigation strategies until they can safely update Struts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"manage-the-trurisk-of-apache-struts-using-the-qualys-platform\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Manage the TruRisk of Apache Struts Using the Qualys Platform</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualys provides extensive solutions to detect vulnerabilities and measure TruRisk.

During this incident, an attacker exploited a misconfigured DNS record for the domain assets.npmjs.com, gaining control of an S3 bucket hosting the NPM package registry. This breach enabled the attacker to inject malicious code into widely used JavaScript libraries, which were subsequently downloaded by millions of developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial observation of the attack focused on a npm package named &#8220;bignum,&#8221; which, up to version 0.13.0, relied on an Amazon S3 bucket to download pre-built binary versions of an addon called &#8220;node-pre-gyp&#8221; during installation. A <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7cgc-fjv4-52x6\">GitHub advisory</a> published on May 24, 2023, revealed that these binaries were published on an expired S3 bucket, which a malicious third party had claimed. As unsuspecting users downloaded the affected package, malware capable of exfiltrating data from their computers was delivered, exploiting the opportunity presented by the once-active S3 bucket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and continuous vigilance in safeguarding software repositories and dependencies against subdomain takeover attacks and other malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1070\" height=\"734\" data-attachment-id=\"34728\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/01/11/totalcloud-insights-crafting-effective-indicators-of-compromise-iocs-for-sub-domain-takeover-risk-detection/attachment/anuj-subdomain-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"4830,3312\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Anuj-Subdomain-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-300x206.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-1070x734.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-1070x734.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34728\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-1070x734.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-300x206.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-768x527.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-1536x1053.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anuj-Subdomain-1-2048x1404.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Figure 1: Static S3 website sub-domain takeover</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s discuss the above scenarios in a static S3 website subdomain takeover:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ideal Scenario:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Static Website Creation</strong>: An organization creates a static S3 website.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DNS Record Configuration</strong>: The organization configures a &#8220;CNAME&#8221;

These vulnerabilities are identified as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, posing a significant threat when combined. Moreover, their severity has been recognized by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), leading to their inclusion in the agency&#8217;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This addition to the CISA&#8217;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog highlights the critical nature of these vulnerabilities and the urgent need for awareness and action, especially given that both CVEs are actively exploited in the wild.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>CVE-2023-46805: This vulnerability is an authentication-bypass issue, rated with a concerning CVSS score of 8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CVE-2024-21887: A more severe command injection flaw was found in multiple web components, earning a CVSS score of 9.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The critical factor here is the combination of these two vulnerabilities. When CVE-2024-21887 is used in tandem with CVE-2023-46805, the requirement for authentication is effectively bypassed. This loophole offers threat actors an open door to craft malicious requests and execute arbitrary commands on affected systems, significantly elevating these vulnerabilities&#8217; risk and potential impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-impact-of-dual-zero-day-threats-in-ivanti-connect-and-policy-secure-gateways\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Impact of Dual Zero-Day Threats in Ivanti Connect and Policy Secure Gateways</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These two severe vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect and Policy Secure Gateways have been exploited with alarming consequences. These vulnerabilities simplify the process for attackers to execute commands on the system. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to a series of critical incidents: sensitive configuration data could be illicitly extracted, existing files on the system could be stealthily altered, remote files could be surreptitiously downloaded, and a covert reverse tunnel could be established from the Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliance, potentially amplifying the severity of an attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"vulnerable-versions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vulnerable Versions</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the products.

If it doesn’t feel right, you should probably not proceed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You do not need to install an app to get any job, ever! Real recruiters will call you, email, or set up a multimedia interview call at their expense without any concern – they are set up for it if they are a recruiter.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never accept a check and cash it digitally from an unknown virtual or digital source. Always go to the bank and treat any such check with high suspicion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been a victim of this fake job scam, we encourage you to visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help\">Facebook Help Center</a> and report the incident to them.
