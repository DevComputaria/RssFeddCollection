Russia-state hackers, Microsoft said, used a technique known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for logging into a “legacy non-production test tenant account” that wasn’t protected by multifactor authentication.

The hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant, Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and assign it rights to access every email address on Microsoft’s Office 365 email service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999478#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999478&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/in-major-gaffe-hacked-microsoft-test-account-was-assigned-admin-privileges/feed/","slash:comments":"100"},{"title":"OpenAI updates ChatGPT-4 model with potential fix for AI “laziness” problem","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999209","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/openai-updates-chatgpt-model-with-potential-fix-for-ai-laziness-problem/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Benj Edwards"},"pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:26:51 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"AI assitants"},{"#cdata-section":"AI laziness"},{"#cdata-section":"ChatGPT"},{"#cdata-section":"ChatGPT-4"},{"#cdata-section":"chatgtp"},{"#cdata-section":"GPT-3"},{"#cdata-section":"GPT-3.5"},{"#cdata-section":"gpt-3.5-turbo"},{"#cdata-section":"GPT-4"},{"#cdata-section":"GPT-4-turbo"},{"#cdata-section":"large language models"},{"#cdata-section":"openai"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999209"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Also, new GPT-3.5 Turbo model, lower API prices, and other model updates."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lazy_robot_hero_2-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A lazy robot (a man with a box on his head) sits on the floor beside a couch.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lazy_robot_hero_2.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"675\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/man-with-box-on-head-sitting-near-sofa-royalty-free-image/1840344369\">Getty Images</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates\">announced</a> updates to the AI models that power its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a> assistant.

But let's not kid ourselves: It does a great job of creating videos of cute animals in ridiculous scenarios, such as using roller skates, driving a car, or playing a piano. Sure, it can do more, but it is perhaps the most advanced text-to-animal AI video generator yet demonstrated.</p>\n\n<p>According to Google, Lumiere utilizes unique architecture to generate a video's entire temporal duration in one go. Or, as the company put it, \"We introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model. This is in contrast to existing video models which synthesize distant keyframes followed by temporal super-resolution—an approach that inherently makes global temporal consistency difficult to achieve.\"</p>\n<p>In layperson terms, Google's tech is designed to handle both the space (where things are in the video) and time (how things move and change throughout the video) aspects simultaneously. So, instead of making a video by putting together many small parts or frames, it can create the entire video, from start to finish, in one smooth process.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998725#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998725&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/googles-latest-ai-video-generator-renders-implausible-situations-for-cute-animals/feed/","slash:comments":"80"},{"title":"AI-generated puffy pontiff image inspires new warning from Pope Francis","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998573","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/pope-francis-warns-of-perverse-ai-technology-that-faked-him-in-a-puffy-coat/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Benj Edwards"},"pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:46:43 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"machine learning"},{"#cdata-section":"pope francis"},{"#cdata-section":"The Vatican"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998573"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Francis fears \"the creation and diffusion of images that appear perfectly plausible but false.\""},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cyber_pope_drip_hero-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A cropped portion of an AI-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a puffy coat that went viral in March 2023.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cyber_pope_drip_hero.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"675\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A cropped portion of an AI-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a puffy coat that went viral in March 2023.

As Even Ackerman in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/karel-capek-robots\">IEEE Spectrum</a> points out, Čapek wasn't happy about how the term's meaning evolved to denote mechanical entities, straying from his original concept of artificial human-like beings based on chemistry.</p>\n\n<p>In a newly translated column called \"The Author of the Robots Defends Himself,\" published in Lidové Noviny on June 9, 1935, Čapek expresses his frustration about how his original vision for robots was being subverted. His arguments still apply to both modern robotics and AI. In this column, he referred to himself in the third-person:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For his robots were not mechanisms. They were not made of sheet metal and cogwheels. They were not a celebration of mechanical engineering. If the author was thinking of any of the marvels of the human spirit during their creation, it was not of technology, but of science. With outright horror, he refuses any responsibility for the thought that machines could take the place of people, or that anything like life, love, or rebellion could ever awaken in their cogwheels. He would regard this somber vision as an unforgivable overvaluation of mechanics or as a severe insult to life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This recently resurfaced article comes courtesy of a <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544504/ir-u-r-iand-the-vision-of-artificial-life/\">new English translation</a> of Čapek's play, called <em>R.U.R. and the Vision of Artificial Life</em>, accompanied by 20 essays on robotics, philosophy, politics, and AI. The editor, <a href=\"https://droplets.vscht.cz/people/cejkova\">Jitka Čejková</a>, a professor at the Chemical Robotics Laboratory in Prague, aligns her research with Čapek's original vision. She explores \"chemical robots\"—microparticles resembling living cells—which she calls \"liquid robots.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998255#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998255&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-robot-should-be-chemical-not-steel-argues-man-who-coined-the-word/feed/","slash:comments":"106"},{"title":"OpenWrt, now 20 years old, is crafting its own future-proof reference hardware","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998169","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/openwrt-now-20-years-old-is-crafting-its-own-future-proof-reference-hardware/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Kevin Purdy"},"pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 20:11:33 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"Tech"},{"#cdata-section":"diy routers"},{"#cdata-section":"open source firmware"},{"#cdata-section":"openwrt"},{"#cdata-section":"router firmware"},{"#cdata-section":"routers"},{"#cdata-section":"wi-fi routers"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998169"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"There are, as you might expect, a few disagreements about what's most important."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wrt54g_salter.jpeg\" alt=\"Linksys WRT54G\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wrt54g_salter.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"451\" data-width=\"800\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Failing an image of the proposed reference hardware by the OpenWrt group, let us gaze upon where this all started: inside a device that tried to quietly use open source software without crediting or releasing it.

A large percentage of TVs and monitors do, too, and that proportion is growing. The sensors allow devices to automatically adjust the screen brightness based on how light or dark the surroundings are. That, in turn, reduces eye strain and improves power consumption.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/study-smart-devices-ambient-light-sensors-pose-imaging-privacy-risk\">New research</a> reveals that embedded ambient light sensors can, under certain conditions, allow website operators, app makers, and others to pry into user actions that until now have been presumed to be private. A proof-of-concept attack coming out of the research, for instance, can determine what touch gestures a user is performing on the screen. Gestures including one-finger slides, two-finger scrolls, three-finger pinches, four-finger swipes, and five-finger rotates can all be determined. As screen resolutions and sensors improve, the attack is likely to get better.</p>\n<h2>Always-on sensors, no permissions required</h2>\n<p>There are plenty of limitations that prevent the attack as it exists now from being practical or posing an immediate threat. The biggest restrictions: It works only on devices with a large screen, in environments without bright ambient light, and when the screen is displaying certain types of content that are known to the attacker. The technique also can’t reveal the identity of people in front of the screen. The researchers, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, readily acknowledge these constraints but say it’s important for device makers and end users to be aware of the potential threat going forward.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998032#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998032&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/ambient-light-sensors-can-reveal-your-device-activity-how-big-a-threat-is-it/feed/","slash:comments":"45"},{"title":"Microsoft network breached through password-spraying by Russia-state hackers","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997633","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Dan Goodin"},"pubDate":"Sat, 20 Jan 2024 01:41:43 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"Security"},{"#cdata-section":"kremlin"},{"#cdata-section":"microsoft"},{"#cdata-section":"russian hacking"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997633"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Senior execs' emails accessed in network breach that wasn't caught for 2 months."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/microsoft-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Microsoft network breached through password-spraying by Russia-state hackers\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/microsoft.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"667\" data-width=\"1000\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Russia-state hackers exploited a weak password to compromise Microsoft’s corporate network and accessed emails and documents that belonged to senior executives and employees working in security and legal teams, Microsoft said late Friday.</p>\n<p>The attack, which Microsoft attributed to a Kremlin-backed hacking group it tracks as Midnight Blizzard, is at least the second time in as many years that failures to follow basic security hygiene have resulted in a breach that has the potential to harm customers.

In a digital environment where computers and servers are located all over the world, each with its own internal clock, there's a significant need for a standardized and accurate timekeeping system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997331#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997331&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/inventor-of-ntp-protocol-that-keeps-time-on-billions-of-devices-dies-at-age-85/feed/","slash:comments":"89"},{"title":"$40 billion worth of crypto crime enabled by stablecoins since 2022","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997330","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/40-billion-worth-of-crypto-crime-enabled-by-stablecoins-since-2022/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"WIRED"},"pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 14:48:58 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"cryptocurrencies"},{"#cdata-section":"pig butchering"},{"#cdata-section":"stablecoin"},{"#cdata-section":"stablecoins"},{"#cdata-section":"syndication"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997330"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Stablecoins like Tether also used for scams and sanctions evasion."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crypto-list-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of cryptocurrency breaking through brick wall\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crypto-list.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1260\" data-width=\"2240\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Anjali Nair; Getty Images)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable value like the US dollar, were created with the promise of bringing the frictionless, border-crossing fluidity of bitcoin to a form of digital money with far less volatility.
