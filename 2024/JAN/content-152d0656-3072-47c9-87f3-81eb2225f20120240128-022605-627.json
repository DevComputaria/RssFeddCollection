The officials also agreed to work toward arranging a call between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meetings Friday and Saturday in Bangkok, which followed up on the presidents&#8217; discussions in November in California, took place after a ruling-party candidate opposed by Beijing won Taiwan&#8217;s recent presidential election and U.S. and Chinese military officials resumed a once-frozen dialogue. They played out as attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to threaten global shipping in the Red Sea.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>A senior U.S. official said Sullivan cited China&#8217;s extensive economic leverage over Iran and emphasized that the destabilizing effect of the Houthi attacks on international commerce. The official noted that China has publicly called for lower tensions, but said it was too soon to tell whether Beijing was using its diplomatic muscle to press Tehran on the matter. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations between Sullivan and Wang and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang said Washington should stand by a commitment not to support independence for Taiwan. Wang said Taiwan&#8217;s election, won by Lai Ching-te, the current vice president, did not alter the Chinese position that the island is part of China and that the biggest challenge in U.S.-China relations is the issue of &ldquo;Taiwan independence,&#8221; according to a statement from the ministry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biden has said he does not support independence, but U.S. law requires a credible defense for Taiwan and for the U.S. to treat all threats to the island as matters of &ldquo;grave concern.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. official said it was not clear when the next Biden-Xi conversation would happen, but that the officials hoped it would take place in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang and Sullivan previously met on the Mediterranean island nation of Malta and in Vienna last year before the Biden-Xi meeting in California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November, both sides showcased modest agreements to combat illegal fentanyl and reestablish military communications, keeping the relationship from growing any worse. The U.S.-China Counternarcotics Working Group is set to hold its first meeting on Tuesday. American officials say fentanyl and its precursors are largely manufactured in China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and in recent years has shown its displeasure at political activities in Taiwan by sending military planes and ships. Earlier Saturday, Taiwan&rsquo;s defense ministry said China had sent more than 30 warplanes and a group of navy ships toward the island during a 24-hour period, including 13 warplanes that crossed the midline of the Taiwan Strait &mdash; an unofficial boundary that&rsquo;s considered a buffer between its territory and the mainland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wang also said China and the U.S. should use the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries this year as an opportunity to reflect on past experiences and treat each other as equals, rather than adopting a condescending attitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The countries should &#8220;be committed to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, building a correct way for China and the U.S. to interact,&rdquo; the statement quoted Wang as saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan has said six Chinese balloons either flew over the island or through airspace just north of it, days after the self-governing island held its election. Lai&rsquo;s Democratic Progressive Party largely campaigned on self-determination, social justice and a rejection of China&rsquo;s threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from cross-strait issues, Sullivan and Wang also discussed Russia&rsquo;s war against Ukraine, the Middle East, North Korea, the South China Sea, and Myanmar, the White House said. Sullivan and Wang talked about progress toward holding a dialog this spring between U.S. and Chinese officials on artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sullivan highlighted that although Washington and Beijing are in competition, both sides have to &ldquo;prevent it from veering into conflict or confrontation,&rdquo; according to a White House summary of the meeting.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589389/biden-aide-beijing-iran-relations-yemen-houthis-attacks/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589389"}},{"title":"U.S. Suspends Funding to U.N.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres &ldquo;is horrified by the news&rdquo; that workers with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, may have been involved in the attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, and urged the agency&rsquo;s chief to refer the accused for potential prosecution, his office said in a statement Friday. According to the statement, there will be an &ldquo;urgent and comprehensive independent review&rdquo; of the agency.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The claims come as a black eye for UNRWA, which provides humanitarian assistance and protection to Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank. It has long been regarded with suspicion by Israel and Republicans in the U.S., who argue that it only fuels the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and money going to food, education and health care frees up Hamas to fund hostilities against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;These shocking allegations come as more than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the agency has been providing since the war began,&rdquo; UNRWA Director-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Friday. &ldquo;Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel said it will seek U.S. and European Union support to halt UNRWA operations in Gaza. Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote in a post on X that his ministry wants to ensure the agency &ldquo;will not be part of the day after.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He urged the U.N. to take &ldquo;immediate personal actions&rdquo; against the UNRWA leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While criticism over UNRWA&rsquo;s role in the Israel-Palestinian conflict became even more charged after Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel, the group has also paid a heavy price in Israel&rsquo;s bombardment of Gaza, with more than 150 of its staff killed in the violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A vast majority of UNRWA&rsquo;s 30,000 staff is Palestinian, with 13,000 of those in Gaza. The U.S. State Department said in a statement Friday that 12 UNRWA staff had been accused of links to the attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. &mdash; UNRWA&rsquo;s main donor &mdash; also announced Friday it was suspending additional funding for the organization in the wake of the allegations. &ldquo;There must be complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks of Oct. 7,&rdquo; State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in the statement. The US contributed more than $296 million to the group in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K., Australia, Canada, Italy and Finland also said they are pausing additional funding to UNRWA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senator James Risch, an Idaho Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had warned the Biden administration for years about funding the agency, which he said &ldquo;has a history of employing people connected to terrorist movements like Hamas.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the recent allegations, the U.S. signaled it continues to support the agency. UNRWA plays &ldquo;a critical role in providing lifesaving assistance to Palestinians, including essential food, medicine, shelter, and other vital humanitarian support,&rdquo; Miller said in the statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU also expressed concern over the allegations, and said it expects UNRWA &ldquo;to provide full transparency on the allegations and to take immediate measures against staff involved.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589373/us-suspends-funding-unrwa-hamas-staff-involvement-claims/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589373"}},{"title":"American Museum of Natural History Closes Certain Displays Amid New Federal Regulations","link":"https://time.com/6589334/natural-history-museum-native-american-displays-federal-regulations/","comments":"https://time.com/6589334/natural-history-museum-native-american-displays-federal-regulations/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Mallory Moench"},"pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 15:18:56 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"News Desk"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6589334"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"The American Museum of Natural History has closed certain Native American displays in accordance with new federal regulations."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"\n<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6589334\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6589334/natural-history-museum-native-american-displays-federal-regulations/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP626866681107.jpg\" alt=\"American Museum of Natural History\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Museum of Natural History in New York City is the latest institution across the country to close access to Native American exhibits as authorities return or seek permission from tribes to display artifacts in accordance with a new Biden Administration rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The museum&rsquo;s president Sean Decatur <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/about/statement-new-nagpra-regulations\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">informed staff in a letter </a>Friday of the closure of two of its halls filled with Native American objects, as well as the covering of cases in or just outside three other halls, starting Saturday.

Since December, the company&rsquo;s 9-month &ldquo;Ultimate World Cruise&rdquo; has captivated &mdash; and confused &mdash; a following of avid watchers on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Millions are following the journey through the eyes of the passengers, as they live and post their lives aboard a vessel they&rsquo;ll be on for nearly a year. If it sounds like a reality show, that&rsquo;s exactly what some watchers have turned it into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Icon of the Seas was first revealed in October 2022, the ship spurred the single largest booking day and the highest volume booking week in Royal Caribbean&rsquo;s then 53-year history, according to the cruise line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Icon of the Seas is divided into eight neighborhoods across 20 decks. The ship includes six waterslides, seven swimming pools, an ice skating rink, a theater and more than 40 restaurants, bars and lounges. The ship can carry up to 7,600 passengers at maximum capacity, along with 2,350 crew members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is powered by six dual-fuel engines, which can be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), a fuel alternative that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cruising.org/en-gb/sustainability-data\"  target=\"_blank\">Cruise Lines International Association</a>&nbsp;says reduces sulfur and greenhouse gas emissions.

He continued to deny wrongdoing following the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant, who worked in the company&rsquo;s legal and talent departments.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The suit includes allegations that McMahon, now 78, forced Grant into a sexual relationship in order for her to get and keep a job and passed around pornographic pictures and videos of her to other men, including other WWE employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AP typically does not name accusers in sexual assault cases, but Grant&rsquo;s representatives said she wished to go public. Her lawyer declined to comment Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McMahon&#8217;s statement said that he was leaving the board &ldquo;out of respect&rdquo; for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wwe-wrestling-summerslam-sponsorship-wrestlemania-mcmahon-02aa3e527ce3f5294ef40852826065c7\"  target=\"_blank\">WWE and TKO Group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I stand by my prior statement that Ms. Grant&rsquo;s lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth,&rdquo; he said in the statement. &ldquo;I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McMahon stepped down as WWE&rsquo;s CEO in 2022 amid an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-vince-mcmahon-wrestling-28e22d3c652591f42d47ef0285564623\"  target=\"_blank\">investigation into allegations</a> that match those in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, where WWE is based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-wrestling-vince-mcmahon-96383ccbcf78e48a7ebe579fdeabba73\"  target=\"_blank\">McMahon was the leader</a>&nbsp;and most recognizable face at WWE for decades. When he purchased what was then the World Wrestling Federation from his father in 1982, wrestling matches took place at small venues and appeared on local cable channels. WWE matches are now held in professional sports stadiums, and the organization has a sizable overseas following.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WWE merged last April with the company that runs Ultimate Fighting Championship to create the $21.4 billion sports entertainment company TKO Group Holdings, and McMahon served as that group&rsquo;s executive chairman of the board until Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TKO Group&#8217;s representative referred media inquiries about McMahon&#8217;s resignation to his statement.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/01/vince-mcmahon-resigns-rape-lawsuit-tko-group-holding-sex-trafficking-1235805961/\"  target=\"_blank\">Deadline</a>&nbsp;first reported that he was stepping down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. McMahon does not control TKO nor does he oversee the day-to-day operations of WWE,&rdquo; TKO Group said earlier this week. &ldquo;While this matter pre-dates our TKO executive team&rsquo;s tenure at the company, we take Ms. Grant&rsquo;s horrific allegations very seriously and are addressing this matter internally.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant also names as defendants in the lawsuit the WWE and John Laurinaitis, an ex-pro wrestler and the company&rsquo;s former head of talent relations and general manager. WWE and Laurinaitis did not return requests for comment Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the lawsuit, McMahon lived in the same building as Grant and in 2019 offered to get her a job at WWE after her parents died.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She alleges that he eventually made it clear that one of the requirements of the job was a physical relationship with him and later with Laurinaitis and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few years, McMahon lavished her with gifts including a luxury car, the suit says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also alleges that McMahon offered one of his star wrestlers &mdash; a person not named in the lawsuit &mdash; sex with Grant as a perk in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WWE benefited financially from the commercial sex act venture orchestrated by McMahon, including by having wrestling talent, such as WWE Superstar, sign new contracts with WWE after McMahon presented Plaintiff as a sexual commodity for their use,&rdquo; the lawsuit states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant is seeking unspecified monetary damages and to have the court void a $3 million nondisclosure agreement, of which she alleges she received only $1 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ms. Grant hopes that her lawsuit will prevent other women from being victimized,&rdquo; her attorney, Ann Callis, said in a statement Thursday. &ldquo;The organization is well aware of Mr. McMahon&rsquo;s history of depraved behavior, and it&rsquo;s time that they take responsibility for the misconduct of its leadership.&rdquo;</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589318/vince-mcmahon-resigns-wwe-sexual-misconduct-lawsuit/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589318"}},{"title":"As Trump Vies to Blows Up Border Deal, Migrant Crisis Could Get Worse","link":"https://time.com/6589254/border-biden-texas-trump/","comments":"https://time.com/6589254/border-biden-texas-trump/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Brian Bennett and Nik Popli"},"pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"Donald Trump"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6589254"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Experts say a humanitarian crisis border will likely get worse if Congress doesn't act."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"\n<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6589254\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6589254/border-biden-texas-trump/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1915162134.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants Continue To Cross Southern Border As Washington Lawmakers Struggle To Find Solution\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald Trump is not in office, but he&rsquo;s using his hold on the Republican Party to hold up border funding negotiations in Congress, kneecapping the federal government&#8217;s ability to better address a situation widely viewed as a logistical nightmare and humanitarian crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n<p>A bipartisan group of Senators were rushing on Friday to hammer out a legislative package that would put billions of dollars in new resources toward the southern border, where federal officials have been overwhelmed by a <a href=\"https://time.com/6553088/venezuelan-migrant-crisis-collective-trauma-essay/\" >surge in migrant crossings</a>. In October, President Joe Biden sent an emergency funding request to Congress asking for more agents, officers and deportation flights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late Friday, Biden made clear he is ready to take harsh actions on the border, saying in a statement that the border security package negotiated in the Senate would give him authority to &#8220;<a href=\"http://shut down the border\"  target=\"_blank\">shut down the border</a> when it becomes overwhelmed,&#8221; and, he wrote, &#8220;I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting any border package through both chambers of Congress was always going to be a challenge, but Trump&rsquo;s urging of Republicans to refuse to help the Biden administration address the situation is prompting predictions that the issue may be dead until after the November election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such an outcome could exacerbate an already dangerous dynamic on the border, say immigration experts and lawmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It continues to hamstring the administration in establishing effective border control,&rdquo; says Doris Meisner, a former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. &ldquo;To not provide additional funding means it will continue to be extremely difficult to process people at the border, to place people that don&rsquo;t have valid asylum claims into removal proceedings, to have funding to do return and deportation flights.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his original request to Congress, Biden <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/10/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-supplemental-funding-request\"  target=\"_blank\">asked</a> for funding to hire 1,300 border patrol agents, 1,600 asylum officers, and 1,000 customs officers and drug investigators as well as new border security technology that can detect fentanyl at ports of entry. Biden also requested funds to hold more people in immigration detention and conduct more flights to remove people from the country who don&rsquo;t have a legal pathway to stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a move that was widely viewed as showing how serious he was about getting a deal, Biden  signaled a willingness to change asylum rules, something sought after by Republicans, but that some Democrats had long opposed. Such a change could enable border officials to send some migrants back home more quickly and deter others from coming. &#8220;I believe we need significant policy changes at the border, including changes in our asylum system to ensure that we have authorities we need to control the border,&#8221; Biden said on Jan. 19. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to act,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Now the question&#8217;s for the Speaker and House Republicans: Are they ready to act as well? They have to choose whether they want to solve a problem or keep weaponizing an issue to score political points against the president.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The push for increased border funding comes as illegal crossings have reached a record high, with more than 2.4 million apprehensions in the 2023 fiscal year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters\"  target=\"_blank\">government data</a>. Border patrol agents reported encountering 10,000 migrants per day for multiple days in December, stretching already overwhelmed resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate leaders have been pushing for a bipartisan agreement that links border security funding with money for Ukraine, but that is likely a nonstarter in the Republican-led House. Still, some lawmakers had expressed hope in recent weeks that a stand-alone border package was still viable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to continue to perpetuate the crisis at the border,&rdquo; Republican Sen. Tom Tillis of North Carolina said on Thursday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about politics and not having the courage to respectfully disagree with President Trump&hellip; I didn&#8217;t come here to have a president as a boss or a candidate as a boss.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked by TIME if the situation at the southern border could get worse if that money is not approved, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated the Administration&rsquo;s hope to get a bipartisan border deal signed into law. &ldquo;We&#8217;re having a very important conversation with the Senate, Senate Republicans and Democrats,&rdquo; she said on Friday. &ldquo;We think Congress must act; they need to act. And that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to deal with this issue.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biden Administration is working with Mexican authorities to try to disrupt criminal human smuggling gangs bringing people from all over the world through Mexico to the U.S. border. It is also working to open offices in central American countries to process refugee claims before people make the dangerous journey to the U.S. border.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But those efforts aren&rsquo;t expected to meaningfully address the current crisis. Experts say what the administration needs most pressingly is more personnel and other resources at the border. If the current influx continues unabated, it will only encourage more people to try to cross over, says Meisner. She explained that the lengthy backlogs in processing forces border officials to allow many migrants to enter the U.S.&mdash;often for months or even years&mdash;as they wait for asylum hearings to determine their status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A speedier system that more quickly identified those without legitimate asylum claims and returned them to their home countries would discourage more people from coming to the U.S., she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;People complain &lsquo;fix the border,&rsquo; says Meisner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible to fix the border just in the executive branch. To fix the border requires actions by Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congress &ldquo;is the part of our government that is missing in action at this point,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s meddling in the negotiations came to light on Wednesday in a closed-door meeting with Republicans that was first reported by <a href=\"https://punchbowl.news/archive/12524-punchbowl-news-am/\"  target=\"_blank\">Punchbowl News</a>. In the meeting, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged that Trump wants to make the situation at the southern border one of the key issues of his campaign and has urged Republicans to oppose the deal so that immigration remains a political vulnerability for Biden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;A Border Deal now would be another Gift to the Radical Left Democrats,&rdquo; Trump said on social media on Friday. &ldquo;They need it politically, but don&#8217;t care about our Border. What is currently being worked on in the Senate will be meaningless in terms of Border Security and Closure.&rdquo; The former President added that the &ldquo;ONLY HOPE&rdquo; for a secure border was voting for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson delivered his own warning shot to Senate negotiators on Friday, writing in a new letter that the emerging border deal&mdash;if reached&mdash;would be &ldquo;dead on arrival&rdquo; in his chamber, and reiterated his call for the Senate to pass the House&rsquo;s more stringent immigration bill that aims to restrict migrants&rsquo; asylum eligibility and reinstate family detention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although he did not mention Trump by name in the letter, Johnson previously said that he &ldquo;<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/johnson-speaks-trump-frequently-border-negotiations/story?id=106483545\"  target=\"_blank\">frequently</a>&rdquo; talks about congressional border negotiations with the former President, who urged him to oppose compromising. &ldquo;Many of our constituents have asked an important question: &lsquo;What is the point of negotiating new laws with an administration that will not enforce the laws already on the books?&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnson wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some Senate Republicans are concerned that by giving up on a border security bill in hopes of helping Trump, it allows President Biden and Democrats to claim that the GOP would rather have more chaos at the border than solve the actual problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called Trump&rsquo;s directive to oppose the border deal to help his presidential campaign &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn&rsquo;t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is really appalling,&rdquo; Romney told reporters on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Republicans, however, disagree that Trump is the reason for the dwindling support of the border deal. &ldquo;No one has seen the border deal, and even its advocates admit it will do little to secure the border immediately,&rdquo; Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1750890870558068827\"  target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on social media on Friday. &ldquo;Blaming Donald Trump or any Republican for killing this deal is political malpractice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump further meddled in the Biden administration&rsquo;s dealings on the border this week when he urged states to send their National Guards to the border to support Texas, after the US Supreme Court backed the Biden administration&rsquo;s plan to remove razor wire installed at the border at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott&rsquo;s direction. Abbott has vowed to block the federal government from removing the razor wire.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589254/border-biden-texas-trump/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589254"}},{"title":"Who Needs Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2024?","link":"https://time.com/6589026/holocaust-remembrance-day-2024/","comments":"https://time.com/6589026/holocaust-remembrance-day-2024/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Rabbi Moshe Hauer"},"pubDate":"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"freelance"},{"#cdata-section":"Israel-Hamas War"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6589026"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Rabbi Moshe Hauer wrestles with the meaning of Holocaust Remembrance Day amidst the attacks on Israel and rising antisemitism."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"\n<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6589026\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6589026/holocaust-remembrance-day-2024/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1962974275.jpg\" alt=\"Eve Of International Holocaust Remembrance Day\"/>\n\n\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n<p>Recently, my mother, who escaped Hungary as a young teen in 1943 as the Nazis were closing in, called me from her home in Jerusalem. She was quite agitated, asking why even Israel&rsquo;s loyal friends seem to be promoting compromise on issues fundamental to its security. She begged me to speak to anyone and everyone I know, from community leaders to elected officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world marks Saturday, January 27, as the annual International Holocaust Remembrance Day, it is clear that my mother needs no such day.

The U.N. has yet to condemn the explicitly and admittedly genocidal acts of Hamas against Israel on October 7 while its International Court of Justice is trying Israel for genocide in Gaza. If this is the result of remembering the Holocaust, we Jews would prefer they forgot about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jews surely don&rsquo;t need this day. Many of us have been remembering the Holocaust every day since that dark day in October. The Holocaust is why we do not use the word &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; to describe the monstrous and unspeakable acts of cruelty committed in Be&rsquo;eri and Kfar Aza, the blind hatred that drives others to destroy us even if it destroys them, and the apathy of the nations of the world who &ndash; with the notable exception of the United States and a few others &ndash; are either supporting evil or standing silently by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my mother, for me, and for many Jews, the Holocaust is the precedent, the comparable, the question that, since the Hamas massacres, bewildered and frightened Jews have been asking themselves and anyone who will listen. The Holocaust is why we have no naivete about the tunnel builders, hang gliders, and missile launchers who, in their unflagging genocidal pursuit of the Jews, continue to dream, plan, rearm, and reorganize. It is why we in the U.S. are so frightened by the violent tone of the ubiquitous pro-Palestinian protests and by the intimidation of <a href=\"https://time.com/6333456/jewish-students-college-antisemitism-essay/\" >Jews on campuses</a>. We have seen this all before and shame on us if we allow ourselves to forget and fall prey once again to the empty promises of those masquerading as peacemakers and to the assumption that in the Western civilized world of course Jews will be safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyday since Oct. 7, my mother is reminded of and haunted by the delusions of her grandparents and more than a dozen uncles and aunts who naively chose not to join her parents&rsquo; escape to Palestine as the Nazi menace spread, only to be turned to ashes in Auschwitz. She often muses aloud about how my father, of blessed memory, a Holocaust survivor, would process October 7th in Israel, October 8th in Harvard, and October 9th in the UN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let us not cancel Holocaust Remembrance Day. Let us mark it with those who have traditionally been our friends and supporters in government and the arena of public opinion, those people we have brought year after year to Yad Vashem and other Holocaust memorials, who have wished only good for the Jewish people but who see our situation from the outside.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they have done much good for us, and still do mean well, it has now become obvious that they cannot possibly see the current realities as we do. These friends are now wavering, running out of patience, understandably shaken by the devastating images from Gaza and by their desperate desire to bring the hostages home, hoping against hope&mdash;as do all good people&mdash;for the imminent arrival of the blessings of peace. It is for these reasons they are urging Israel to stop the war short of achieving its critical goal of decisively destroying Hamas and its terror infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a classic Jewish teaching that warns us against judging others until we stand in their place. Things look different from the sidelines than they do from the battlefield. Holocaust Remembrance Day is an opportunity for American and allied leaders and citizens to stand in our place and see Hamas, the United Nations, the ICJ, certain protestors and university leaders, and a long list of others through the eyes of Jews, the survivors of the Nazis and the Jew-haters of each and every generation, experiencing once again an all-too-familiar existential threat. To see them through the eyes of my mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also an opportunity for these allies and friends to stand in the places of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of the leaders and press of the free world who failed miserably in the 1930&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. It is the current generation&rsquo;s opportunity, to do it right, to act decisively against evil by living up to the commitment made by Churchill on February 9, 1941: &ldquo;Give us your faith and your blessing, and, under Providence, all will be well. We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle, nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would make Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024 meaningful for everyone, even my mother. Maybe she would finally feel like people are listening, learning from the history she lived, and will take the right actions now.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589026/holocaust-remembrance-day-2024/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589026"}},{"title":"Taylor Swift Deepfakes Highlight the Need for New Legal Protections","link":"https://time.com/6589263/taylor-swift-deepfakes-legal-protections/","comments":"https://time.com/6589263/taylor-swift-deepfakes-legal-protections/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Solcyre Burga"},"pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 22:31:44 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"News Desk"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6589263"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Ten states have criminal laws against deepfakes, but there is currently no federal law in place."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"\n<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6589263\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6589263/taylor-swift-deepfakes-legal-protections/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Swift.jpg\" alt=\"TOPSHOT-US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GOLDEN-GLOBE-ARRIVALS\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Deepfake pornographic images of <a href=\"https://time.com/6342806/person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift/\" >Taylor Swift</a> have been shared across the social media platform X, highlighting the lack of digital privacy protections for victims across the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t known who generated the fake images of Swift<strong>,</strong> which have been viewed tens of millions of times since Wednesday. On Friday, X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1750765055380263272\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> their team was working to remove all non-consensual nudity from their site, which is &ldquo;strictly prohibited.&rdquo;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users,&rdquo; the company said. Swift has not publicly commented on the matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swift may be the latest celebrity target of deepfakes, but Carrie Goldberg, a New York City based lawyer who works with victims of tech abuse, says that she&rsquo;s seen an increase in children and non-celebrities falling victim to this form of online abuse over the past decade. &ldquo;Our country has made so much progress in banning the non-consensual dissemination of nude images, but now deepfakes are sort of filling in that gap [of legal protections],&rdquo; Goldberg says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deepfakes&mdash;manipulated media files that depict a false image or video of a person&mdash;have <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2023/deepfakes-real-threat.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">been increasing in popularity</a> over the past few years. Previous estimates <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-porn-is-out-of-control/\"  target=\"_blank\">by Wired</a> show that in the first nine months of 2023, at least 244,635 deepfake videos were uploaded to the top 35 websites that host deepfake pornography.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten states&mdash;like Virginia and Texas&mdash; have criminal laws against deepfakes, but there is currently no federal law in place. In May 2023, Rep. Joe Morelle, a Democrat from New York, introduced the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act to criminalize the non-consensual sharing of sexual deepfake images online.The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, but has <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3106?s=1&amp;r=64\"  target=\"_blank\">not seen any progress</a> since. In January, legislators also introduced the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications (No AI Fraud) Act, which would protect Americans from having their images and voice manipulated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advocates warn that this issue especially poses a risk for young women, who are overwhelmingly the victims of deepfakes. &ldquo;Deepfakes are a symptom of a broader problem [of] online violence against women and girls that has historically not been prioritized by tech companies and society,&rdquo; says Adam Dodge, founder of Endtab (Ending Tech-Enabled Abuse), a digital safety education and training company for victims of online harassment. &ldquo;&#8203;&#8203;I&#8217;m hopeful that this Taylor Swift attack shines a bright enough light on an issue that&#8217;s been around for years that we actually see action to prevent and hold accountable the people that are creating and sharing these images.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Legal protections for victims&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deepfakes, which Dodge describes as a &ldquo;form of face-swapping,&rdquo; are alarmingly easy to make. Users don&rsquo;t need any experience with coding or AI to generate them. Instead, online platforms can generate them for online users with just a few clicks and the submission of a photo or video. Deepfakes can be used for explicit content, but can <a href=\"https://time.com/6565446/biden-deepfake-audio/\" >also be used</a> to generate false audio messages which have the potential to disrupt elections, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts warn that there is an expansive system of companies and individuals that benefit from and could be liable for deepfakes. &ldquo;Starting at the very top, there&#8217;s a search engine where you can search &lsquo;How do I make a deepfake&rsquo; that then will give you a bunch of links,&rdquo; Goldberg says. &ldquo;There&#8217;s the products themselves which exist just for malicious purposes&hellip;the individual who&#8217;s actually using the product to create the database, and then the viewers who might be [sharing] it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dodge says that because the internet facilitates the spread of content so quickly&mdash;Swift&rsquo;s deepfakes, for instance, had more than 27 million views and 260,000 likes in 19 hours, <em>NBC News</em> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/taylor-swift-nude-deepfake-goes-viral-x-platform-rules-rcna135669\"  target=\"_blank\">reports</a>&mdash;its nearly impossible to remove all fake content from the internet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deeply concerning when time is of the essence and every second that that image is up it&#8217;s getting shared and downloaded at an exponential rate,&rdquo; he says. Companies like Google and X ban the <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/manipulated-media\"  target=\"_blank\">sharing of any</a> misleading media, but may still be slow to act or take down the media files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holding social media platforms legally liable for the dissemination of deepfakes is difficult due to protections <a href=\"https://time.com/6256887/supreme-court-section-230-internet/\" >under Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act. The law says that &ldquo;no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,&rdquo; meaning platforms like Instagram or Facebook are not responsible for the third-party content uploaded on their site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldberg, however, says it&#8217;s possible to hold a company responsible if there&rsquo;s a unique feature that allows that platform to perpetuate harm. It&rsquo;s how Goldberg won a case to shut down Omegle, an online chat room that allowed for anonymous video streaming, <a href=\"https://www.cagoldberglaw.com/ca-goldberg-pllc-requires-omegle-com-to-shut-down-forever-as-settlement-term-in-product-liability-lawsuit-for-sex-trafficking-our-client/\"  target=\"_blank\">in Nov. 2023</a> for facilitating child sex abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Dodge warns that the U.S. lacks infrastructure needed to properly help victims of deepfakes. &ldquo;Law enforcement is not properly trained or staffed to go after these anonymous attackers and as a result, victims who experienced this meet roadblocks to justice really quickly,&rdquo; he says. Part of that is because investigators may not understand how deepfakes function; Dodge says that many victims he&rsquo;s spoken to have to take on the burden of figuring out how to remove the images themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution, experts say, would require the law to stop protecting companies that profit off of these sorts of images and videos, especially since they are so easy to generate. &ldquo;We can&#8217;t keep somebody from taking our photograph&hellip;you can&#8217;t blame the victim here,&rdquo; Goldberg says. &ldquo;All they&#8217;ve done is exist.&rdquo;</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://api.time.com/6589263/taylor-swift-deepfakes-legal-protections/feed/","slash:comments":"0","post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6589263"}},{"title":"Britney Spears Fans Boosted a 13-Year-Old Song to No. 1 on the iTunes Chart to Beat Justin Timberlake","link":"https://time.com/6589194/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-selfish-itunes-chart/","comments":"https://time.com/6589194/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-selfish-itunes-chart/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Moises Mendez II"},"pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 22:18:41 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"culturepod"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6589194"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"After Justin Timberlake released his first single in six years titled \"Selfish,\" Britney Spears' fans decided to troll him by boosting her song to No. 1 on iTunes."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"\n<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6589194\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6589194/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-selfish-itunes-chart/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/justin-timberlake-britney-spears.jpg\" alt=\"Britney Spears; Justin Timberlake\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Timberlake&rsquo;s past is catching up to his music career. On Thursday, the singer released his first single in six years, titled &ldquo;Selfish.&rdquo; Over the next day, Timberlake&#8217;s biggest competition on the iTunes chart came from his ex-girlfriend, <a href=\"https://time.com/6325910/britney-spears-memoir-free-britney/\" >Britney Spears</a>. On Friday, Spears&rsquo; 2011 song &ldquo;Selfish,&rdquo; from the album <em>Femme Fatale </em>climbed to the No. 1 spot on the iTunes top 40 singles chart, knocking Timberlake to No. 3. (It hasn&rsquo;t cracked the Spotify charts just yet, but the Spears song is getting airplay on the radio.)</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/BritneyTheStan/status/1750936814141976892?s=20\" ><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Selfish&rdquo; by Britney Spears is being played on the radio in the USA &#127482;&#127480; <a href=\"https://t.co/rNKHbC4R6d\"  target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/rNKHbC4R6d</a></p>&mdash; Britney Stan &#10024; (@BritneyTheStan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritneyTheStan/status/1750936814141976892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"  target=\"_blank\">January 26, 2024</a></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fan accounts dedicated to Spears rallied together on Thursday to buy the song to help it climb the charts, following Timberlake&#8217;s release.
