Mainly because it presents such a risk to our users. Our articles tend to focus on how hackers reuse stolen credentials to compromise accounts to commit crimes like identity theft or fraud.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the reality is that phishing is a profitable activity itself. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Hackers are selling your account details</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/security-info/phishing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing attacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have one purpose – to steal your usernames and passwords. Cybercriminals use carefully crafted messages to trick you into visiting a fake website that looks legitimate. But when you ‘login’, hackers collect your password. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, people send these messages via email. But as attacks become more sophisticated they may also be received via text message, phone call or even app notifications on your smartphone. Advanced attacks may use two or more channels at once (email + SMS for instance) to make the message appear more legitimate – and urgent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once harvested, hackers have a choice. To use the credentials to launch their own attacks or to sell them onto other criminals. Usernames and passwords are extremely valuable too. Although a Microsoft 365 account login can be bought on the </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/deep-web-myths-truths-need-know/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dark web</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a few dollars, bank account details are worth more than $4000 each. Even credentials for general websites hold some financial value because so many people reuse their passwords between services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Realising this, hackers now buy and sell compromised credentials to each other. One estimate suggests that there are more than 24 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">billion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> username and passwords combinations for sale on the dark web.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Phishing as a Service</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most worrying cybersecurity trends is the commoditisation of phishing. Virtually anyone can now “rent” tools to automate and simplify phishing, allowing them to get into credential theft. In the same way that you pay a monthly/annual subscription fee for </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/#plans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antivirus software</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or Netflix streaming, low-skill hackers can subscribe to advanced hacking tools on the dark web.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nSome advanced phishing-as-a-service tools, such as Greatness and W3LL Panel, can defeat the two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms used by many services to protect user accounts. And although security tools can help to protect you against these attacks, your best defence is still common sense. Take a look at our </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/10-tips-prevent-phishing-attacks/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 Tips to Prevent Phishing Attacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Passwords still matter</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IT industry is slowly moving away from passwords, but they remain an essential security protection for most web services. To reduce the potential damage caused by your credentials being exposed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use a unique password for every account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously this is easier said than done, so choose a </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure password manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to generate and store logins – much easier than trying to remember them all yourself! This approach ensures that if someone hacks your eBay account, they cannot use the same password to access your bank account (or similar).</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/stolen-credentials-big-business/\">Stolen credentials are big business</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/stolen-credentials-big-business/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Is YouTube Kids Safe?

Every new movie, video game, song or TV show is available in some form on YouTube, be it in the form of trailers and edited scenes or music videos and commentary.</p>\n<p>To its credit, the website’s safety practices have evolved over the years, but anyone can still upload videos to YouTube — many of which are inappropriate for children. Yes, there are content reviews, and the platform does remove videos for violating its terms. But the chances of your child coming across vulgar or violent content intended for adults are still there.</p>\n<p>A child-friendly app is the perfect solution for this issue — YouTube Kids. But how does it filter content? Is YouTube Kids safe?</p>\n<p>Below is a parent&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/internet-safety-for-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online safety</a> guide to YouTube Kids, including how it works, what you can do to make it safer and age-appropriate alternatives you can look into.</p>\n<h2>What Is YouTube Kids?</h2>\n<p>YouTube Kids is an app Google developed to provide a child-friendly YouTube experience. It offers parents control over the content their children can access, the ability to block and approve content and a customized experience for certain age ranges.</p>\n<p>When you first set up your child&#8217;s profile, you&#8217;ll have three age-based content settings to choose from:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31061\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of YouTube kids with three options for choosing content experience: Preschool, Younger, and Older.\" width=\"1920\" height=\"859\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups.png 1920w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups-300x134.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups-1280x573.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups-530x237.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups-1536x687.png 1536w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Content-Experience-Age-Groups-360x160.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Preschool (Ages 4 &amp; under): Content curated for this age range is suitable for children in that stage of development. It focuses on simple concepts through animated stories, colors, shapes and words.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Younger (Ages 5-8): Content for this age range features more diverse interests and a little less cartoons.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Older (Ages 9-12): This content setting features a lot more videos around music, gaming and vlogs. It&#8217;s the closest the app gets to the wider network of videos on the platform and is most likely to see mature content fall through the cracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>YouTube Kids states, &#8220;Systems work hard to exclude mature content, but not all videos have been manually removed.&#8221; The concern here is that the app, despite its added security features and tight parental control settings, could still expose children to content that isn&#8217;t age-appropriate.</p>\n<p>That said, the app offers options for parents to limit and monitor their children&#8217;s YouTube time, from turning search off to pre-approving channels and determining restricted content.</p>\n<h2>Is YouTube Kids Safe?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31062\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/the-parents-checklist-for-a-safer-youtube-kids-experience.png\" alt=\"illustration depicting child on mobile device with a checklist of YouTube safety tips for parents.\" width=\"1441\" height=\"1418\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/the-parents-checklist-for-a-safer-youtube-kids-experience.png 1441w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/the-parents-checklist-for-a-safer-youtube-kids-experience-300x295.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/the-parents-checklist-for-a-safer-youtube-kids-experience-976x960.png 976w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/the-parents-checklist-for-a-safer-youtube-kids-experience-530x522.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1441px) 100vw, 1441px\" /></p>\n<p>While generally safer than YouTube, YouTube Kids is not entirely safe. Because it&#8217;s all community-created content, anyone with an account can upload content. YouTube employs algorithms and content reviews to make sure everything meets their standards, but the content isn&#8217;t approved pre-upload.</p>\n<p>A lot of the website&#8217;s content management relies on viewers flagging inappropriate content in reports, leading to reviews that get the content removed if it violates the terms of service.</p>\n<p>In the time it takes for the content to be seen, reported, reviewed and removed, your children may come across it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what YouTube Kids tries to prevent, though they still warn parents that their children may see such content and encourage them to report it. It&#8217;s simply not 100% risk-free.</p>\n<p>Parents can disable the search feature entirely, limiting their children&#8217;s access to the curated YouTube Kids channels and content. Ideally, this would prevent unwanted content, but inappropriate videos can sometimes make their way through the cracks.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31063\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of YouTube Kids Search Settings asking Do you want search on or off?\" width=\"1918\" height=\"868\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option.png 1918w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option-300x136.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option-1280x579.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option-530x240.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Search-Off-Option-1536x695.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1918px) 100vw, 1918px\" /></p>\n<h2>Types of Ads Displayed on YouTube Kids</h2>\n<p>YouTube Kids has <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6130541?sjid=17327816858209852950-NA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expressed</a> that they &#8220;only show Paid Ads that are approved as family-friendly.&#8221; They also mentioned that paid advertisements undergo a rigorous review process to ensure compliance with the platform&#8217;s policies and that their ads are appropriate for the app.</p>\n<p>Another child-friendly element of these ads is the absence of click-throughs to carts and purchase pages. So, your four-year-old won&#8217;t be able to take your credit card for a spin while on the app.</p>\n<h2>YouTube Kids Parental Controls</h2>\n<p>You can monitor your child&#8217;s activity through the app&#8217;s parental control settings. The dashboard allows you to customize each child&#8217;s profile and set their content based on their age range. You can turn the search feature on and off, block videos or channels and disable video recommendations based on watch history and search terms.</p>\n<p>The controls will be accessible through the parent menu, where you can set a passcode to limit your children&#8217;s accessibility. You can also access them through your own YouTube account.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31064\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-kids-profile-parental-controls.jpeg\" alt=\"Image of a parent using their laptop to access parental control features with a stylus.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-kids-profile-parental-controls.jpeg 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-kids-profile-parental-controls-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-kids-profile-parental-controls-1280x853.jpeg 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-kids-profile-parental-controls-530x353.jpeg 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31065\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of YouTube Kids Profile Parental Controls for a profile named Jody.\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1209\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control.png 1920w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control-300x189.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control-1280x806.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control-530x334.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Parental-control-1536x967.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<h3>Approved Content Only Mode</h3>\n<p>Instead of opting for age-based recommended content, you can use this feature to limit your child&#8217;s access to content you&#8217;ve seen and approved from creators that you know and trust.</p>\n<p>To activate this feature, navigate to your child&#8217;s account and set their content experience to &#8220;Approved Content Only.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Limit Screen Time</h3>\n<p>You can use the parental settings to set a timer for your child&#8217;s session on YouTube Kids. For example, if you set the timer for 20 minutes, it will display a notification on the child&#8217;s app informing them of the remaining time. When the timer runs out, the app shuts down automatically.</p>\n<p>You can easily use this feature by clicking on the timer icon on the app.</p>\n<h3>Track Viewing History</h3>\n<p>Once set up with a child profile, the app automatically begins tracking every video they watch and every search query they use. You can clear the history at any time, but the app maintains a record of their online activity that you can access when you visit their profile.</p>\n<h3>Block Videos</h3>\n<p>This feature can be used on any video to block content you don&#8217;t approve of. You can either block a specific video or an entire channel. It&#8217;s a good idea to routinely check your child&#8217;s online activity on the app and view history to make sure that you block and report any inappropriate content.</p>\n<p>Each video you watch will have a menu attached to it that allows you to block it.</p>\n<h3>Implement Family Link</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://families.google/familylink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Family Link</a> is an app where parents can manage their children&#8217;s devices and screen time as well as monitor their online activity. It works in tandem with YouTube Kids but isn&#8217;t restricted to it. I recommend using Family Link because protecting your <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/cybersecurity-for-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">child&#8217;s online privacy</a> goes beyond the YouTube app.</p>\n<h2>YouTube Kids vs. YouTube</h2>\n<p>The idea behind YouTube Kids was to quarantine a section of YouTube that contains family-friendly, fun and educational content. YouTube has been around for a very long time and hosts millions of videos, with hundreds of new ones every day.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that people use this platform for everything, from cooking and home maintenance, to tutorials on how to tie a tie. YouTube will always overshadow YouTube Kids in the vast amount of information that it holds.</p>\n<p>YouTube Kids is newer. It&#8217;ll never accumulate that wealth of video content. But it gave seasoned creators like animators, voice actors and cartoon franchises a new home and an audience that encourages content creation.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31066\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids.png\" alt=\"Comparison chart breaking down differences between YouTube and YouTube Kids.\" width=\"1441\" height=\"2734\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids.png 1441w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-300x569.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-506x960.png 506w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-337x640.png 337w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-810x1536.png 810w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-1079x2048.png 1079w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/youtube-vs-youtube-kids-530x1006.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1441px) 100vw, 1441px\" /></p>\n<h2>Safe YouTube Kids Alternatives</h2>\n<p>YouTube Kids is a great choice for a safe online experience for your kids. But there are <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/best-learning-apps-for-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other apps</a> and platforms that you can use to nurture their curiosity, educate them and keep them safe from inappropriate or harmful content.</p>\n<p>Apps like <a href=\"https://kahoot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kahoot</a>, <a href=\"https://pbskids.org/video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PBS Kids Video</a> and <a href=\"https://us.playkids.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PlayKids</a> host various games, cartoons and learning materials for children.</p>\n<h2>YouTube Kids FAQ</h2>\n<p>Keep these answers to common questions about YouTube Kids in mind as you explore its kid-friendly content.</p>\n<h3>Are There Ads on YouTube Kids?</h3>\n<p>Yes, YouTube Kids features ads that appear briefly before videos begin playing. Ads that appear on the app undergo a rigorous review process to make sure that they are compliant with the platform&#8217;s policies and that their ads are appropriate for the app&#8217;s audience.</p>\n<h3>What Are the Cons of YouTube Kids?</h3>\n<p>The lack of a pre-upload review process is one of YouTube Kids&#8217; few cons. Content that isn&#8217;t age-appropriate is usually found pretty quickly through the review process, and creators face more thorough vetting, but there remains the possibility of age-inappropriate content being accessible on YouTube Kids.</p>\n<h3>Is YouTube Kids Free or Paid?</h3>\n<p>YouTube Kids is accessible for free, but there is the option to get YouTube Premium, which provides an ad-free experience and slightly more control over your viewing experience for both YouTube and YouTube Kids.</p>\n<h2>Keep Your Child Safe Online With Panda Security</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/internet-parental-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keeping your child safe online</a> is a constant and unending process that requires vigilance and routine check-ins.

Developers release frequent updates to ensure you can experience the latest the web has to offer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than ever, websites are taking advantage of all the new features enabled by HTML5 video and audio, advanced styling and improved speeds. Many sites have stopped supporting older browser versions due to compatibility and security concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers often target vulnerabilities in web browsers, which is why the companies that make them release regular updates to patch any vulnerabilities. Installing the latest versions helps keep your device secure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fortunately, most common browsers include options to automatically update either in the browser themselves or as part of the operating system update tools.</span></p>\n<h3><b> 2. </b><b>Use a Browser With Advanced Privacy and Security Features</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most modern browsers allow you to create an account so you can reduce your reliance on search engines and synchronize your bookmarks between your laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Many even enable you to see the pages you have open on other devices and open them on the device you are using at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many browsers attempt to offer a secure experience, not all succeed. Millions of users know and trust some names due to their advanced security measures. Browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Tor guard against cyberthreats by allowlisting authorized programs and blocking unknown functions.</span></p>\n<h3><b>3. </b><b>Block Pop-Ups</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While desktop pop-ups from your operating system are unavoidable, pop-ups in your web browser can often be switched off. Browser pop-ups typically open new browser windows to push adverts, and while most are just annoying, some can contain malicious links or inappropriate content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most browsers come with filters that automatically block pop-ups and enable you to allow them for those trusted sites where they may be advantageous. Here&#8217;s how to do this on </span><b>Google Chrome:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><b>Settings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, navigate to </span><b>Privacy and security</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on </span><b>Site settings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigate to </span><b>Pop-ups and redirects</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the </span><b>Don&#8217;t allow sites to send pop-ups or use redirects</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31303\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing Google Chrome settings for pop-ups and redirects\" width=\"1920\" height=\"824\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1.png 1920w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1-300x129.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1-1280x549.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1-530x227.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/pop-ups-1-1536x659.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>4. Pay Attention to URL Security Icons</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can easily tell if a website you&#8217;re visiting provides a secure connection. HTTP indicates that the connection isn&#8217;t secure and is susceptible to third-party interference. HTTPS is the secure version of the protocol, encrypting any data or information you share on that site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the two tags will precede the web address you&#8217;re on. Most browsers also display a URL security icon — a lock sign to indicate that the connection is secure and an exclamation point for when it isn&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the browser and extensions you have, you might see some prompted warnings appear when you follow a link that isn&#8217;t secure. Here&#8217;s what these warnings might look like.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31300\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/website-alert.png\" alt=\"Warning pop-up when you open a link that isn't secure\" width=\"852\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/website-alert.png 852w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/website-alert-300x187.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/website-alert-530x330.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These warnings are the result of frequent malicious or suspicious activity connected to that page.

Ad blockers stop webpages from showing you ads, which sounds great until you realize how controversial this subject is and the profound impact it could have on the websites you visit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of websites use ads in a manner that interrupts and bogs down your browsing experience, making misclicks extremely hard to avoid. Some may even have malware attached to their ads, which can lead to dangerous content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By all means, protect yourself using an ad blocker, but do consider allowlisting your favorite and most trusted sites, as the ad revenue is what keeps them in business!</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31250\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2.webp\" alt=\"Safe web browsing tips\" width=\"1440\" height=\"2420\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-300x504.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-571x960.webp 571w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-381x640.webp 381w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-914x1536.webp 914w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-1219x2048.webp 1219w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/safe-web-browsing-tips-part-2-530x891.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>6. </b><b>Enable “Do Not Track” in Your Browser</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many browsers include the ability to send a “do not track” request to websites, which asks them not to collect or track your browsing data. However, what happens depends on how the sites respond to the request — but most websites and web servers don’t change their behavior and would appear to ignore the request. Still, making it clear you don’t wish to be tracked is a good start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every browser should have its own setting for this, but here&#8217;s how to activate it in </span><b>Google Chrome:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><b>Settings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, navigate to </span><b>Privacy and security</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on </span><b>Third-party cookies</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable the </span><b>Send a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; request with your browsing traffic</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> option.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31298\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing how to block third party cookies\" width=\"1903\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track.png 1903w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track-300x149.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track-1280x635.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track-530x263.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/Do-not-track-1536x762.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px\" /></p>\n<h3><b>7. </b><b>Clear Your Web Browser Cache and Cookies</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if websites do decide to track your browsing data, you can limit the impact by regularly clearing your browser cache and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/spring-cleaning-cookies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deleting unwanted cookies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This prevents ads from following you around the web and can also ensure you have the latest version of a webpage downloaded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All major browsers allow you to do this manually, and you can easily clear all your data, but there are also software options that automate the process to make your life easier. Whichever route you choose to go, it may be worth considering allowlisting those sites that you regularly log in to avoid having to re-enter login details constantly.</span></p>\n<h3><b>8. </b><b>Turn on Private Browsing</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/incognito-mode-is-not-private/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private browsing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protects your private information and blocks some websites from tracking your search and browsing data. It won’t hide your activity from your internet service provider, but it does reduce the accumulation of cookies and can be helpful if you are buying presents online for a significant other.</span></p>\n<h3><b>9. </b><b>Use a VPN</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual proxy networks, or VPNs, help you maintain your privacy by encrypting your data and internet requests before they ever hit the internet. The technology works the same no matter how you have connected to the internet — the </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/difference-vpn-vs-proxy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">encrypted data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is sent to the VPN server, which decrypts the requests before sending them to the online destination. The information is then sent back through the same process, meaning that sites, advertisers and internet service providers can’t track what you are doing. </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/vpn/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VPNs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as the one included in Panda Dome use the most secure encryption protocols on the market to ensure the only person who can see your data is you.</span></p>\n<h3><b>10. </b><b>Use a Password Manager</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of password leaks that occur when websites are hacked makes it very dangerous to reuse the same password for a range of different sites. To prevent password leaks from being too damaging, you need to use unique passwords on every website. These should also be strong passwords — long, unpredictable passwords that contain numbers and symbols.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, remembering all those different passwords is almost impossible — that’s where a password manager</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panda Dome Passwords</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comes in. They encrypt and securely store your login information for all the websites you use and help you log in automatically — leaving you to remember just one master password.</span></p>\n<h3><b>11. </b><b>Ensure You Have Up-to-Date Antivirus and Firewall Protection</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need antivirus and firewall protection software on your computer, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even if you&#8217;re cautious when navigating links and files.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Threats can be hidden in even the most reputable websites or files, and ensuring you are protected with a smart antivirus platform is well worth a small investment in time. The most reputable antivirus software solutions currently available use big data and AI to monitor every running application and detect attacks before they happen.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Closing Thoughts on </b><b>Safe Web Browsing</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internet can be an unpredictable place. Safe web browsing practices should be every web surfer&#8217;s priority, especially since the majority of our important information is stored in the digital world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the right browser, the right features, and the right </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/vpn/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VPN</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be the difference between disaster and safe web browsing.

Rise in AI-powered Chatbot Attacks</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2024, <strong>we anticipate an increase in attacks on AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT or Bard</strong>. Hackers may attempt to manipulate prompts to extract sensitive information from datasets that AI programs may have missed or left unfiltered.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Automation and AI-driven Phishing Development</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals are expected to leverage chatbots for phishing campaigns in 2024, creating more convincing messages. Additionally, <strong>chatbots like ChatGPT can be used by hackers to program malware, scripts, and automations</strong>, further resembling the operations of a legitimate service-oriented business.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Surge in Vishing Attacks</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI&#8217;s ability to <strong>recreate human images, faces, and voices will lead to an increase in vishing attacks</strong> based on deepfake technology. These attacks are more effective as they use real data, adapt to context and the victim, and exploit traditionally considered secure methods like voice or facial recognition.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Cybersecurity Workforce Crisis</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, a challenging point is the projected crisis in the cybersecurity sector. Leading strategic consulting firms, including Gartner, forecast a need for more cybersecurity professionals while the workforce&#8217;s actual numbers decrease. This gap is influenced by <strong>factors such as costs, management difficulties, and a lack of strong corporate culture in certain business segments</strong>.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. New Attacks Exploiting AR/VR Headsets and QR Codes</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WatchGuard predicts a surge in attacks exploiting augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets, as well as QR codes, in 2024. <strong>These technologies have experienced rapid growth</strong>, reaching a point where expansion brings about increased security issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>These are the top 5 predictions from WatchGuard and <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/\">Panda Security</a> for 2024</strong>.

The strange boxy barcodes were often used on Covid passes (remember them?) to prove vaccine status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now we are familiar with how to use them, businesses are deploying QR everywhere.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What is ‘quishing’?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QR codes are incredibly versatile. You can encode virtually anything in in one of those squares, from website addresses to WiFi passwords to contact details and more. And anyone can make their own using </span><a href=\"https://www.qr-code-generator.com/free-generator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free QR code tools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing a new opportunity, hackers are generating QR codes that direct victims to fake websites. Just like a traditional </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/security-info/phishing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">phishing website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the user will then be encouraged to disclose sensitive personal information like passwords or credit card details. Sometimes the victim may also be encouraged to download malware from the site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So by adding ‘hacked’ QR codes to emails, instant messages or social media replies, hackers can trick people into visiting fraudulent websites.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why is quishing effective?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two reasons why quishing is effective. First, <strong>you cannot ‘read’ the encoded website without scanning</strong> <strong>the QR code</strong>, making it hard to identify if the address is legitimate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, it is common practice to <strong>use </strong></span><strong><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/shortened-urls/\">URL shorteners</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> when creating QR codes</strong> to make them perform more effectively. But even if your QR code scanner app shows the website address before you visit. It is impossible to accurately determine where the shortened URL points to. Which means you may expose yourself to additional risk by clicking through the link.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How to defend against quishing?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that defending yourself against quishing is very similar to protecting yourself against regular phishing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, <strong>never scan a QR code from an unknown source</strong>. If attached to an email or message from a known </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and trusted</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sender, or printed in a magazine, the code is likely to be safe. But if the image comes from an unknown account, or you see one out in public (stuck to a wall for instance), you should </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scan it because you cannot verify its authenticity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, <strong>keep your wits about you</strong>. If you do scan an unknown QR code. Make sure you do the usual checks of the destination website before entering any personal information or downloading any files. Make the sure the website is secure (check for the padlock icon in your address bar) and that the address itself is correct (facebook.com NOT facebookmail.com etc).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, <strong>enable </strong></span><strong><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/google-authenticator-what-is-it/\">muiti-factor authentication</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on your online accounts. If you are tricked into visiting a fraudulent website and you do disclose your password, cybercriminals will still not be able to use that information. The reason is because they do not have access to your other authentication tools (such as the Google Authenticator app). Hopefully you never find yourself in this position however.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Use your common sense</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the emergence of new threats like quishing, many of these attacks can be easily avoided by remaining aware and using your common sense.

The incidents include the personal information of millions of Americans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>LoanDepot</strong>, one of the biggest mortgage lender providers in the USA, suffered a major ransomware attack. In a short </span><a href=\"https://loandepot.cyberincidentupdate.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement on its website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the company confirmed that it had to take some systems offline after a cyber incident. LoanDepot has yet to confirm the type of information stolen. However, mortgage companies collect and store sensitive personal information such as social security numbers. There is no information on how many million people have been affected by the breach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Nationstar Mortgage LLC</strong> (dba Mr. Cooper), another large mortgage provider in the USA, also suffered a cyberattack recently. Hackers were stealing company information for about a month. The stolen data includes personal details such as full name, address, SSN, and date of birth. The fraudsters have stolen the details of approximately 15 million people. This incident is particularly unpleasant because the stolen info is not only of Mr. Cooper&#8217;s customers but also of people who have applied for a loan from the company but were not approved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LoanCare, which performs <strong>loan sub-servicing functions</strong> for smaller mortgage companies, also reported a <strong>data breach</strong>. After an investigation, the company determined that there were personal information in the compromised data. Bad actors stole <strong>names, addresses, SSNs</strong>, and even <strong>loan numbers</strong>. The number of people affected by the breach is approximately 1.3 million. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LoanCase has begun sending letters to the affected customers that provide  <strong>free 24-month access</strong> to identity monitoring services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple lawsuits have already been filed against the companies for failing to protect personal information. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Why are mortgage companies so attractive to hackers?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortgage service providers collect extremely sensitive information about their customers and applicants. Hackers cannot only find all the pieces of the puzzle needed to commit fraud but can also see additional details about potential victims that are not easily available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such info includes copies of tax returns, banking info, and detailed information about workplaces, salary, and even the type of car people drive. Such data points help hackers target victims in the most lucrative way possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Victims are advised to be vigilant, keep an eye on credit reports, and always be protected with <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/\"><strong>high-quality antivirus software.</strong></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mortgage-companies-cyber-attacks/\">Multiple mortgage companies hit by cyber attacks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mortgage-companies-cyber-attacks/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Safe shopping this sales season","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/safe-shopping-sales-season/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/safe-shopping-sales-season/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Thu, 11 Jan 2024 12:53:53 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Tips and Best Practices"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"panda dome"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30850"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2024/01/compras-seguras-rebajas-2024-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Safe shopping this sales season\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">January has arrived and what marks this month on a global scale are sales.

That&#8217;s why we want to give you some tips on how to shop online safely during the 2024 sales.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What are the risks of so many sales in all kinds of sectors and shops?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sales and the buying frenzy on the web during the sales season are becoming the best breeding ground for cybercrime these days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant increase in online transactions is often exploited to deploy a whole arsenal of digital threats, which become more sophisticated year after year, including social engineering attacks, malware deployment and various scams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most representative threats include the following:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Phishing</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/types-of-phishing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> manifests itself through fraudulent communications that fake legitimate companies. Such emails and text messages contain links or attached documents that, when opened, could result in the risk of personal and financial data being compromised. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Online scams</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This threat comes in many different forms. From fictitious refunds to misleading sales, with the aim of stealing information or, directly, money.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Malware</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/types-of-malware/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malware</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acts silently and can be devastating. This is because it involves compromising the devices of individuals and businesses, extracting digital assets without consent.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The risk of online shopping at specific time of the year </strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been proven that when specific times of the year arrive, such as the sales in this case, the online dangers are increased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales days are days in which many more users (and we are not just talking about absolute numbers, but people who do not shop online during the rest of the year) make use of e-commerce.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals take advantage of this situation. They carry out strategies to try to trick users who may not have the appropriate knowledge to avoid falling into the trap. In addition, the more transactions there are, the more likely they are to succeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will now discuss some of the dangers to which users are exposed when making an online payment.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Some of the dangers to which users are exposed</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Information saturation:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  The huge number of offers can lead to information saturation, making it difficult for consumers to really judge the quality of offers.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fake sales promotions:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some shops may pump up prices before sales and then offer discounts that are not as significant as they appear to be.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Momentum buying:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Time pressure and tempting offers can drive consumers to make impulse purchases without serious consideration.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Tips for safe shopping during 2024 sales </strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Panda Security we are aware of how careful you have to be when shopping online, that&#8217;s why we want to give you some essential tips for this sale.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Check the security of the website</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Make sure that the website where you enter your credit card information is secure. Check that the URL begins with &#8220;https://&#8221; and look for a padlock icon in the address bar.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use secure payment methods.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Making payments through payment platforms such as Google Pay, Apple Pay or PayPal are the most popular and safest options for consumers as they do not directly share card details with the merchant.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Avoid using public networks.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Avoid making card transactions over public Wi-Fi networks, as they may be less secure. Use secure and trusted connections.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Monitor your transactions.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Regularly review your statements for suspicious activity. If you find any unauthorized transactions, contact your bank immediately.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don&#8217;t store data on websites.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Avoid letting websites save your card information, even if they offer the option.

Bots.\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /><p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day the world sends billions of emails and instant messages, posts hundreds of millions of social media updates and shares vast numbers of photos with friends and family. Then there’s online shopping, banking, remote working, video conferencing and more, all passing through the internet, connecting us wherever we are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even as internet usage grows, it makes up just a fraction of total online traffic. In fact, one recent report suggests that these human-led activities account for just 27% of internet use. So where does the other 73% come from?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malicious bots.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bad bots break passwords</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security researchers estimate that nearly three quarters of online traffic is caused by cybercriminals and scammers. They have been using smart systems (‘bots’) to automate many of the common tasks involved in hacking and online theft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take credential stuffing, a popular technique for breaking into an online account:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hacker acquires a list of stolen usernames and passwords.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They choose a target website, like Amazon, and begin testing the stolen credentials to see if they can access an account.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take control of the account and use to place fraudulent orders or steal personal information.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repeat the process for the next credential pair.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a human, this process can take a few minutes for each username / password combination. And for a target list that contains hundreds or thousands of credentials, testing them all could take weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now imagine you could automate this process. Using bots, the hacker can do the credential checking process automatically, which is much quicker than having to do it themselves. Bots can even attack several websites simultaneously, allowing the hacker to increase their chances of success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For cybercriminals, line any legitimate business, time is money. So they invest in attacks that yield the biggest results soonest. With bots they have found a way to maximize their reach quickly and cheaply.</span></p>\n<h2><b>More than simply stealing passwords</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a way to make money online, criminals have probably already found a way to automate it with bots. Bots can be used to take web services offline with a </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/ddos/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for instance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other bots may ‘scrape’ personal information from public websites and feed it into a machine learning algorithm to improve future hacking attempts. They can also create fake website accounts, defraud advertisers, create and send spam (including SMS messages) and more.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Good technology used for bad</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bots are an incredibly useful technology. Think of the chatbots used by many websites to help you locate the product or service you need, using AI-driven questions and responses to give you information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, bots have become a very valuable tool for criminals – and the amount of malicious bot activity grows every year. Expect to see another significant rise in attacks next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, make sure your personal information is secured against bot attacks with </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panda Dome Passwords</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (to strengthen and secure your login credentials) and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/premium/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panda Dome Premium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (to prevent your device becoming a bot).</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/why-internet-so-busy-bots/\">Why is the internet so busy?
