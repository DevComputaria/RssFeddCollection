The Houthis have been responding to the ongoing conflict in Gaza by attacking shipping lanes in the Red Sea, attempting to use the geopolitically critical Gulf of Aden to strangle one of the world&rsquo;s most important commercial routes, and therefore escalating pressure on the West to end the conflict.</p>\n<p>Of course, the US has been completely unreasonable in its unconditional backing of Israel&rsquo;s military campaign, and rather than confronting the problem directly, it has proposed another idea &ndash; to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bba68661-6c9b-41b5-ab74-d573b3a27c54\">outsource both blame and resolution to China</a> and ask Beijing to help end the conflict. This is not a new tactic by Washington, as it has done the same thing with the Russia-Ukraine war, crafting a narrative that it is China&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;</em> to end it, of course, conveniently on terms that are favorable to America.</p>\n<p>In reality, the US has absolutely no chance of getting China to end these respective conflicts, primarily because it is in China&rsquo;s best interests not to secure outcomes that amount to geopolitical gains for America. However, that is the point in itself, as the US wants to intentionally frame Beijing as <em>&ldquo;the bad guy&rdquo;</em> and therefore push the perception that Beijing is a challenge to the international order and a threat to peace. The US is effectively trying to gaslight China by making it look morally bad for conflict Washington itself creates and not agreeing to the outcomes Washington wants. It is a blame game.</p>\n<p>American foreign policy has little room for compromise and is driven by a zero-sum mindset that emphasizes absolute strategic gains for the US at all costs. The US does not negotiate with its adversaries for the sake of peace, but rather attempts to maintain a long-term strategic posture in the hope they, through pressure or other means, eventually capitulate to US preferences. For example, the US position regarding the Ukraine war has never been to negotiate with Russia or respect its strategic space but to attempt to impose a strategic defeat on Moscow and enable further expansion of NATO, which in turn is another vehicle for American pressure. Even as this approach is proving increasingly ineffective, there&rsquo;s no shift in Washington&rsquo;s foreign policy in sight.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b37a5185f5405e633a6fef.jpg\" alt=\"RT\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/591308-tanker-costs-surge-red-sea/\">Fuel tanker costs surge on Red Sea crisis – Bloomberg</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Similarly, the US has been happy to offer unconditional backing to Israel in its war in Gaza, despite claiming to push for peace. Washington has allowed the conflict to continue and avoided calling for a ceasefire at all costs. It then responds harshly to the instability the conflict creates, such as attacks from the Houthis. Logically speaking, Houthi attacks would stop if the US ended the conflict in Gaza, but that&rsquo;s just how US foreign policy thinking works. There must never under any circumstances be concessions regarding the strategic status quo, only a doubling down on the current position with any options necessary. That&rsquo;s the thinking that led Washington to scrapping the Iran nuclear deal and allowing a peace process with North Korea to collapse.</p>\n<p>Now, the US is articulating a strategy whereby when conflict occurs, it tries to outsource responsibility by blaming the lack of peace on China. As the narrative generally goes, <em>&ldquo;If only China would act and stop this, then there would be peace,&rdquo;</em> whether it be in Gaza, Yemen, Ukraine, or wherever. Of course, that peace is strictly conditional on terms the US has set and not terms that China itself might want to set. If Beijing does press for peace but on alternative terms to what America wants, such as attempting to mediate in Ukraine rather than pushing for the collapse of Russia, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/04/china-xi-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-diplomacy-global-south/\">those peace terms are quickly rejected and condemned by the mainstream media.</a></p>\n<p>What we have is a no-win situation where Beijing is framed as a perpetuating, if not instigating, force in conflicts, no matter what it does. China is portrayed as actively preventing peace, or alternatively, enabling the <em>&ldquo;enemy&rdquo;</em> side to continue its perceived aggression and offering terms that favor said <em>&ldquo;enemy,&rdquo;</em> and therefore is complicit in antagonism towards the West. China is therefore made out as a threat to the international order and world peace unless it agrees to exactly what the US wants, which of course, logically works against the interests of China as a whole. Why, for example, would China agree to crippling Russia? Or turn against its strategic partner, Iran? This narrative always and deliberately ignores the role that the US has played in instigating, escalating, and perpetuating the given conflicts at hand and pushes the <em>&ldquo;good vs. evil&rdquo;</em> binary rather than acknowledging the complex realities of geopolitics.</p>\n<p>In reality, China is always careful to explicitly take no sides in such conflicts and strives for balance, such as when it mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, for the US, which thinks only about zero-sum political gains as opposed to peace in the interests of all, this will never ever be acceptable. Therefore China remains a villain and a threat.</p>\n<p></p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b5a8fc85f540072f09308e.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jan 2024 01:08:40 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"Germans expected to make their own bomb shelters – Bild","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/591383-germans-build-own-shelters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/591383-germans-build-own-shelters/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b59e2185f540116f20f83e.jpg\" /> Germany’s new contingency plan reportedly lays out what should ordinary citizens should do if a war breaks out <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591383-germans-build-own-shelters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>The national draft emergency defense plan reportedly sees ordinary citizens</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Germans will be expected to turn their homes into bomb shelters in case a major war breaks out in Europe, newspaper Bild reported on Saturday, citing a draft document from the country&rsquo;s Defense Ministry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the report, the ministry is set to complete the work on the classified &lsquo;Operational Plan&rsquo; (OPLAN) by April.

Watching the Biden administration wave in record flows of lawless migrants &ndash; with total disregard for the harms caused to American citizens &ndash; is painful, so seeing Abbott defy the federal government is soothing.

The trend has certainly gotten far worse under Biden, but Republicans have campaigned on the immigration issue for decades without taking the obvious steps needed to secure the border.</p>\n<p>Case in point: Republicans controlled both houses of Congress when Trump took office in 2017, but the border wall that he promised was never built. There were no mass deportations of illegal aliens. Nor were there mass arrests of the traitorous employers who enable the influx by hiring people who can&rsquo;t legally work in the US. Taxpayers were forced to continue footing the bill, as always.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the ruling-class expectation for law-abiding citizens: Work hard and shut up while paying for us to undercut your wages and make your communities more crowded and less safe. Those who whimper too loudly are branded with the scarlet R-word (racist).</p>\n<p>That same ruling class will make sure that Abbott&rsquo;s border maneuverings have no significant effect. The Biden administration has fought much harder to block the state&rsquo;s security measures than to police the border. Despite claiming that it doesn&rsquo;t have enough border agents to secure the border, the administration had plenty of manpower to rip out the concertina wire that Texas troops were using to seal off high-traffic crossing points. When Texas put floating barriers in the Rio Grande River, the administration sued the state, claiming that Abbott was endangering migrants.</p>\n<p>The Texas National Guard has seized control of a park at a key crossing point, but Biden can simply federalize those troops to get his way, as some Democrat politicians have already suggested. He wants to ensure that Border Patrol agents can do their important work of removing the state barriers to avoid inconveniencing the immigrants who flout US law.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b33908203027711c277b88.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Texas Dept. of Public Safety officers guard an entrance to a park near the US-Mexico border, Eagle Pass, Texas, January 11, 2024.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591303-republican-governors-texas-border/\">25 US Republican governors back Texas in standoff with Biden</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Biden has greased the invasion skids like no president before him. Nearly 2.48 million illegal aliens were encountered by Border Patrol agents in the government&rsquo;s latest fiscal year, which ended on September 30, and there was an all-time high of more than 300,000 last month alone.</p>\n<p>Those who are &lsquo;encountered&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t turned back. The administration has released millions of illegal immigrants and bogus &lsquo;asylum seekers&rsquo; into the country, ostensibly to await court hearings. Those hearings won&rsquo;t happen for years, or even decades, and many immigrants will simply skip them when their court date finally arrives. Millions more have come through the border as &lsquo;gotaways&rsquo;, without being &lsquo;processed&rsquo; by the Border Patrol.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the surge in border traffic has been accompanied by increases in child trafficking and drug trafficking. Fentanyl transported across the border by drug cartels is killing thousands of Americans every month. More than 112,000 Americans died from drug overdoses between May 2022 and May 2023, primarily from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. At the same time, there has been a 56-fold increase in the number of Border Patrol encounters with people who had been flagged on the US terrorist watch list.</p>\n<p>The situation has gotten so bad that Americans of all political stripes and demographic categories see it as not merely a crisis, but an invasion.

New York Mayor Eric Adams was so flustered that he claimed the migrant influx will <em>&ldquo;destroy&rdquo;</em> America&rsquo;s largest city.</p>\n<p>The problem is, although this is fun to watch, it&rsquo;s a distraction from the fact that the border remains wide open, and shifting the consequences around the country isn&rsquo;t a victory. Confuse, divide, conquer. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>\n<p>In any case, Texas has no legal authority to deport the millions of illegal aliens coming across the border or those already in the state. And if it did have the power to do so? Both major political parties have already demonstrated that they have no intention of removing the cheap labor favored by their donors.</p>\n<p>The Texas-Washington DC tensions may be eased if Biden is able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to beef up border security. He&rsquo;s seeking to trade some tough-sounding (but ineffectual) immigration measures to get Republicans to approve more than $60 billion in additional funding for another disastrous Washington project: The Ukraine proxy war.</p>\n<p>The longer-term goal is to finally achieve the ruling-class dream of <em>&ldquo;comprehensive immigration reform,&rdquo;</em> which basically means amnesty for millions of illegal aliens already here and some fake gestures on border security.</p>\n<p>Law-abiding citizens will continue to suffer the consequences and incur the costs, and their votes will be disenfranchised over time.

The administration has insisted that only the federal government has authority over border enforcement, including the detention and deportation of illegal aliens, and the White House has blamed former President Donald Trump for leaving behind a broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>US voters are apparently more inclined to believe Abbott&rsquo;s assessment of the situation. A <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590298-us-border-crisis-seen-as-invasion-poll/\">Rasmussen Reports</a> poll released earlier this month showed that 65% of voters believe the border issue is not just a crisis, but an <em>&ldquo;invasion.&rdquo;</em> A majority of respondents in every demographic and political category, including 55% of Democrats, agreed that their country is being invaded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>The numbers</strong></p>\n<p>Border Patrol agents encountered more than 300,000 illegal immigrants crossing into the US in December, an all-time high for a single month. Illegal border crossings have surged since Biden took office in January 2021 and began dismantling Trump&rsquo;s policies. Nearly 2.48 million illegal aliens were encountered at the border in the government&rsquo;s latest fiscal year, which ended on September 30, compared with just 458,000 during Trump&rsquo;s last full fiscal year in office. Those figures don&rsquo;t include millions of so-called <em>&ldquo;gotaways&rdquo;</em> who crossed into the country without being confronted by federal officers.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.12/thumbnail/6580967185f5403f210d571f.jpg\" alt=\"Republican Presidential candidate former U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during a campaign rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center on December 17, 2023 in Reno, Nevada\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/589289-us-donald-trump-mass-deportations/\">Trump vows ‘largest deportation in American history’</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s administration released nearly 1.4 million illegal aliens into the US in the last fiscal year, in many cases letting them stay in the country while awaiting court hearings for dubious asylum claims, according to the <a href=\"https://cis.org/Arthur/Biden-Funneled-Nearly-14-Million-Illegal-Aliens-US-FY-2023-Alone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Center for Immigration Studies</a> in Washington. The backlog of cases is so large that some asylum seekers may be waiting in the country for decades before they are given a court date, and many simply choose not to show up for their hearing when the time finally arrives.</p>\n<p>Republican leaders have also argued that Biden&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;open-borders&rdquo;</em> policies are jeopardizing national security. More than 172 illegal immigrants encountered by Border Patrol officers in the last fiscal year had been flagged on the nation&rsquo;s terrorist watch list. That compared with only three such encounters during Trump&rsquo;s last year in office.</p>\n<p>Critics have blamed the border crisis for rises in drug smuggling and human trafficking, too. More than 112,000 Americans died from drug overdoses between May 2022 and May 2023, mostly from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. <em>&ldquo;Every state is a border state under the Biden administration&rsquo;s policies, and hardworking Americans are paying with their lives,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;US Senator Katie Body Britt, an Alabama Republican, said earlier this month.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Biden&rsquo;s conundrum</strong></p>\n<p>The standoff with Texas puts Biden in an awkward position politically at a time when he is campaigning for re-election later this year and most Americans are displeased with his performance on border enforcement.

Previous cases included an effort by Kentucky to nullify a 1798 federal law that enabled the government to deport aliens deemed a threat to national security. South Carolina passed a state law in 1832 trying to nullify federal tariffs that were disproportionately burdensome to southern states.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/585969-us-democracy-political-violence/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Civil war 2.0?

Abbott has tried to ramp up pressure on Biden and other Democrats over the border crisis by busing illegal aliens to Democrat-controlled cities. Those efforts have brought the immigration issue home in places such as New York City and Chicago. New York Mayor Eric Adams has warned that the migrant influx <em>&ldquo;will destroy&rdquo;</em> his city, and he has criticized Biden for failing to alleviate the crisis.</p>\n<p>Republican lawmakers, such as Representatives Chip Roy of Texas and Clay Higgins of Louisiana, have applauded Abbott&rsquo;s defiance of the federal government. Higgins went so far as to say, <em>&ldquo;The feds are staging a civil war, and Texas should stand its ground.&rdquo;</em> Arkansas Governor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahHuckabee/status/1750581732389327060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a> said, <em>&ldquo;If President Biden won&rsquo;t defend us, states will have to defend themselves.

And one particular incident here in France has just shifted the nascent movement into overdrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alexandra Sonac, a 35-year-old cattle and corn farmer from the south of France, and two of her three family members were struck by a car in the dark early morning hours at a farmers&rsquo; highway blockade near Toulouse. Sonac and her 12-year-old daughter <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68066310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">were killed</a>, while her husband is in intensive care. The incident is still under investigation, but to add insult to injury, the three Armenian occupants of the vehicle that struck the family were reportedly under an expulsion order.</p>\n<p>The symbolism here is glaring. A productive farmer resisting government economic oppression was killed by someone who has enjoyed the benefits of government laxity. Just <a href=\"https://fr.statista.com/statistiques/1373500/part-obligations-de-quitter-le-territoire-realisees-par-pays-ue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12%</a> of expulsion orders were carried out by France between 2015 and 2021, one of the lowest rates in Europe, according to recent statistics.</p>\n<p>French farmers&rsquo; complaints converge with those of their counterparts across the EU. They&rsquo;re angry with their own governments, but only because these elected officials have insisted on sliding into the fitted straitjacket imposed on them by the unelected technocratic tyrants in Brussels and their top-down, ideologically driven policies. There&rsquo;s a good reason why French farmers this week have ripped up and <a href=\"https://x.com/f_philippot/status/1750133942441709612?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">burned</a>&nbsp;the same EU flag that President Emmanuel Macron insists on placing alongside the French tricolor in his various appearances.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.12/thumbnail/657af9e6203027619e52c099.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: People place flowers in front of the middle school where school teacher Samuel Paty was murdered, October 18, 2020, Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, France.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/589059-muslim-student-paris-teacher/\">France’s teachers can’t do their job for fear of upsetting Muslim students</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Farmers all across the bloc have similar demands. They want a fair price for energy while the EU not only has imposed&nbsp;costly climate policies that treat fossil fuels like the plague, but has also decided, <em>&ldquo;for Ukraine,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;to destroy its own supply of cheap Russian gas that drove Europe&rsquo;s economy. Then, again for Ukraine, they decided to lift import duties on goods and services from Ukraine, allowing the EU to be flooded with truckers who undercut local providers and with equally undercutting farm products that don&rsquo;t even meet the EU standards with which European farmers are forced to comply at their own expense. Farmers don&rsquo;t want handouts, but they want governments to lay off the increasingly heavy taxation as their solution to filling state coffers emptied as a result of their constantly misplaced priorities. They also want their national governments to defend their interests against Brussels&rsquo; attempts to replace them with cheap foreign imports through endless free trade deals with countries whose farmers don&rsquo;t operate under the same regulatory diktats, all while Brussels pushes member states (notably the Netherlands) to buy out farms whose cattle waste doesn&rsquo;t serve its climate change policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that the average person sympathizes, since they&rsquo;re equally fed up with their incompetent heavy-handed government serving as a white glove for Brussels&rsquo; iron fist. They <a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/amp/news/The-Ukrainian-War-Benefits-the-French-Arms-Industry-Lecornu-20240118-0012.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see</a> that their gas and electricity costs are endlessly climbing, and their buying power is circling the drain, all while the French defense minister, for example, talks about how the Ukraine conflict, that has served as a convenient pretext for&nbsp;Europe&rsquo;s transfer of wealth from the people to the elites, is such a wonderful opportunity for the military industrial complex.&nbsp;And when the French National Assembly <a href=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/politique/institutions/assemblee-nationale/300-euros-de-plus-par-mois-lassemblee-augmente-les-frais-de-mandat-des-deputes-811fbba0-bad0-11ee-afe8-d81ceac7fa4c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">approved</a> themselves a &euro;300 ($327) a month increase in their own allowances this week, just to offset the inflation that&rsquo;s crushing the average citizen, it serves as yet another example of their total tone-deafness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of January 24, a massive row of tires and manure was set ablaze by angry French farmers right in front of the prefecture of Agen, in southwest France. Some farmers present denounced the move, others voiced their support, but all agreed to being fed up. More tellingly, police and firefighters on the scene dragged their feet in reacting as the smoke extended almost to the height of the adjacent building, considered a symbol of the French state. Apparently, even frontline workers who serve the state&rsquo;s institutions are getting fed up with the establishment elites. And not just in Europe, but elsewhere in the West.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Canadian Freedom Convoy truckers and their supporters were vindicated in Canadian Federal Court this week when a judge ruled that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s government constitutionally violated fundamental rights and freedoms when it evoked the Emergency Act against protesting opponents to the government&rsquo;s Covid mandates, which they considered a violation of basic rights and freedoms. The fact that the government ordered bank accounts blocked as a deterrent against protesting should have been the first big hint of growing authoritarianism, but apparently it took a federal judge to spell it out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>German farmers and truckers who began convoying across the country earlier this month told me in Berlin that they were inspired by the Freedom Convoy as they railed against the German government&rsquo;s imposition of more taxes on the diesel that fuels their farm vehicles, already pricy as a result of the government&rsquo;s misguided energy policies driven by ideological, knee-jerk opposition to fossil fuels and to cheap gas from Russia. In both the Freedom Convoy and farmer cases, grotesque attempts by government officials to portray protesters as some kind of right-wing radicals, to absolve elites from responsibility, have fallen flat among the general population.&nbsp;</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65a66f9a85f54054174b49d0.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator wears a sticker on his jacket reading: &quot;Too much is too much&quot; in front of Berlin&#039;s landmark Brandenburg Gate during a protest of farmers and truck drivers, on January 15, 2024 in Berlin.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590733-germany-protest-farmers-truckers-drivers/\">‘Extremists stoking rage’: The German government seeks to downplay protesting workers' plight</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Truckers, bakers, students, firefighters, and police are already showing signs of solidarity with the farmers, backed by an overwhelming and quantified silent majority. And these national movements are finding common cause with each other around Europe and the Western world. Attempts to foster division by pitting big farms against small ones or right against left fall flat.</p>\n<p>French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who only started in the job on January 9 and probably still hasn&rsquo;t found all the washrooms at his new office, trudged down to the rural southern Rhone region last weekend. Attal said that <em>&ldquo;our farmers are not bandits, polluters, people who torture animals, as we sometimes hear.&rdquo;</em> Where does he hear that? In Brussels? His seduction skills could use some work. It&rsquo;s like showing up for a date and saying, <em>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re not as psycho as I heard you were.&rdquo;</em> What a charmer. Can&rsquo;t wait to see how this diplomatic savant is going to resolve this whole mess.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A meeting last Monday between Attal and farming reps included a delegate for the Young French Farmers Union. I spoke with several of their counterparts in Berlin at that protest earlier this month &ndash; young entrepreneurs, so well-spoken and educated. These young farmers say they work 80-hour weeks and feel there is so much red tape or prohibitions from the EU that it&rsquo;s paralyzing. And yet France is desperate to encourage young people to adopt farming as a profession at a time when it&rsquo;s a dying business. Gee, big mystery why that might be, geniuses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The tragic deaths of Alexandra Sonac and her daughter this week will forever stand as a symbol of struggle against the oppression of the working class by an authoritarian global governance that&rsquo;s fomenting chaos as it caters to special interests increasingly divorced from those of the average citizen. No amount of tinkering by the offending governments will quell the growing unrest. Only a deep and fundamental rethinking of their relationship with their citizens, whose interests they&rsquo;re supposed to serve exclusively, would have any hope of resolving this deepening crisis.&nbsp;</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b2664d85f54069c65563e6.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 14:02:12 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"US Supreme Court approves first nitrogen execution","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/591269-supreme-court-nitrogen-execution/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/591269-supreme-court-nitrogen-execution/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b25fd520302722403e3230.jpg\" /> The US Supreme Court has denied a request to halt the country’s first ever execution by nitrogen gas on Thursday <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591269-supreme-court-nitrogen-execution/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>Kenneth Eugene Smith will be put to death using a method that advocates say is painless</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>The US Supreme Court has denied a request to halt the execution of a convicted murderer by nitrogen gas.

Thus, foreign policy played a crucial part in New Hampshire as the neocon faction headed by Nikki Haley, who represents the militant McConnell-Cheney wing of the Republican Party, attempts to stay relevant.</p>\n<p>Much to the delight of the defense industry, the presidential election cycle is happening at a precarious moment on the global stage, where military conflicts &ndash; complete with the participation of nuclear powers&nbsp;&ndash; are raging in both the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Many Republicans cannot imagine Haley anywhere near the levers of power at such a dangerous juncture. At least Trump can say that he kept America out of new military conflicts during his four years as president, a rare feat by modern US standards.</p>\n<p>On the question of national defense, it&rsquo;s also necessary to mention Trump&rsquo;s arch-nemesis, US President Joe Biden, who secured a write-in victory in New Hampshire. Undoubtedly, the greatest point of contention between the MAGA camp and the US leader is the situation on the US-Mexico border, where every year millions of illegal immigrants pour into the country at great expense to both safety and financial resources.</p>\n<p>This month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott attempted to halt the madness by installing barbed-wire fencing along the Rio Grande. Those efforts were quickly dashed by the Supreme Court, which is supposedly weighed in favor of the Republicans.

Its budget went from &euro;364 million ($395 million) in 2020 to &euro;859 million, while its staff has nearly doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200. Its <em>&ldquo;standing corps&rdquo;</em> is supposed to be the EU&rsquo;s first uniformed and armed police force, to number 10,000 by 2027.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Leijtens, 60, is a former lieutenant-general in the Dutch police who once commanded a Dutch security mission in Afghanistan and fought corruption in the Caribbean, among other things. He was appointed director-general of Frontex in December 2022, with the mission of establishing <em>&ldquo;secure and well-functioning external borders&rdquo;</em> of the EU.&nbsp;</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b024df20302760336afbd9.jpg\" alt=\"Texas National Guard soldiers stand guard on the banks of the Rio Grande river at Eagle Pass, Texas, January 12, 2024\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591171-supreme-court-texas-border/\">US Supreme Court allows Biden to dismantle Texas border fence</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Sometimes it is pretended that you can simply put a cap back on the bottle and then the migration will be stopped. But that is a misconception,&rdquo;</em> he said. Instead of turning back immigrants on the borders and the high seas, or swiftly deporting those whose asylum claims are ruled groundless, Leijtens has proposed a four-step plan for <em>&ldquo;good border management.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Step one is a crackdown on people-smuggling and illegal crossings, while opening up legal immigration. Step two is ending <em>&ldquo;alarmism&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;superficial preoccupation&rdquo;</em> with migration, which <em>&ldquo;is a reality,&rdquo;</em> he said. Step three is to ensure the EU knows exactly who is coming in, and step four is properly processing asylum applicants and deporting those who fail, because <em>&ldquo;the rule of law prevails here.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Last November, the European Parliament passed amendments to the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), seeking to curb illegal immigration. The changes call for processing asylum seekers at the external border and deporting failed applicants immediately.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>More than a million people applied for asylum in the EU last year, most of them in Germany, almost reaching the record of 1.3 million from 2015. Though around half of the applicants were rejected, only one in five have been deported, because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. In 2023, Frontex registered 380,000 <em>&ldquo;irregular&rdquo;</em> border crossings into the EU, a 17% increase over the previous year.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;This talk of &lsquo;stopping people&rsquo; and &lsquo;closing borders&rsquo; cannot be our narrative all the time. My job is to create a balance between effective border management and compliance with fundamental rights,&rdquo;</em> Leijtens told Die Welt.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>He is willing to make deals with Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, because the EU <em>&ldquo;depends on the capabilities and will of these countries&rdquo;</em> to combat <em>&ldquo;irregular migration.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;However, Brussels <em>&ldquo;must provide something in return: visa facilitation, more legal routes into the EU, and economic support,&rdquo;</em> Leijtens added. He has ruled out negotiations with Libyan militias, however, describing them as human rights violators and potential war criminals.</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b04be185f5406c903671cb.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 23:33:50 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"IDF suffers its deadliest day in Gaza","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/591174-israel-idf-highest-casualty-rate/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/591174-israel-idf-highest-casualty-rate/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65b044022030275b8b377cbd.jpg\" /> Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed revenge after 21 IDF soldiers were killed in one attack, the most since the war in Gaza began <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591174-israel-idf-highest-casualty-rate/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>The Israeli prime minister has vowed retribution after Hamas killed 21 troops in a single attack, the most since the war began</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retribution on Tuesday against Hamas after&nbsp;the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) lost 24 soldiers in Gaza.

First, why will it not work? Second, why would it be harmful if it <em>did</em>? That rule holds in Germany, where the really bad idea of banning the party Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland (AfD) is currently getting much debate.</p>\n<p>The background of this debate is simple. Founded a decade ago, the AfD has established itself as a lasting feature of the political landscape. A populist right-wing party (roughly comparable to, for instance, the Austrian FP&Ouml;), it brings together politicians and voters across a spectrum of positions. In the AfD, this spectrum ranges from very solidly conservative to far right.</p>\n<p>Still comparatively small, the AfD is significant. With currently just over 40,000 members, it holds 78 of 736 seats in the <em>Bundestag</em>, the central parliament in Berlin. Importantly, it is also well-represented in 14 of 16 regional parliaments, where it occupies 242 seats of 1898 (for all regional legislatures taken together). In terms of its impact on national debates, it clearly punches far above this quantitative weight.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, however, the AfD is on a roll, on both the central and regional levels. If Germans were to vote for the <em>Bundestag</em>&nbsp;now &ndash; and thus in effect the chancellor&rsquo;s office &ndash; the AfD would net <a href=\"https://www.merkur.de/politik/waehlergunst-umfrage-schock-fuer-scholz-spd-verliert-weiter-in-der-zr-92777862.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">23%</a>. That can be compared with the traditional center-left SPD, leading the hapless coalition government, at 14%. All parties from the ruling coalition (SPD, Greens, and the market-liberal FDP) together muster just 31% approval.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65aa2e332030276fde4578de.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Sahra Wagenknecht, member of the Bundestag, speaks at a press conference in Berlin, Germany, on December 12, 2023.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590926-political-force-germany-sarah-wagenknech/\">A ‘pro-Russian monster’ or a force for common sense? A new party is reshaping the German political landscape</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>On the regional level, the picture is largely the same, with particularly pronounced AfD advances in the area of the former East Germany. For the <em>Land</em> of Brandenburg, for instance, a <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/regionales/berlin/article249578892/Umfrage-SPD-liegt-in-Brandenburg-hinter-AfD-und-CDU.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poll</a> has the AfD in the lead with 28%, easily beating both the CDU mainstream conservatives (18%) and the SPD (17%). Adding insult to injury, AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla is also surpassing the SPD&rsquo;s Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the personal-popularity scale, which is admittedly a low bar, as Scholz has managed to become one of the most disliked German politicians ever.</p>\n<p>No wonder that Germany&rsquo;s under-qualified and somewhat hysterical <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article249578672/Robert-Habeck-AfD-will-aus-Deutschland-einen-Staat-wie-Russland-machen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minister of the economy</a>, Robert Habeck, in whose head all of Russia seems to live rent-free, is publicly hallucinating that the AfD wants to make Germany like Russia. (The irony is, of course, is that with Habeck&rsquo;s own mismanaged ministerial portfolio, quite a few Germans would welcome having Russia&rsquo;s growth rates.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such rhetoric, as well as the timing of when the idea of an AfD ban is being floated, betrays the fact that the attempt to popularize the idea of outlawing the AfD is an opportunistic response to its increasing electoral clout, which of course cannot be openly admitted. So, those in favor of a ban argue that the AfD is an extremist party.</p>\n<p>But crucially here, extremism has a specific, legally (and narrowly) defined <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/verfassung/parteienrecht/parteiverbot/parteiverbot-node.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meaning</a>.&nbsp;According to the German Constitution (Article 21.2), the Constitutional Court (and only that court) can prohibit a party when it substantially endangers the constitutional order of the Federal Republic or its existence itself. An important and often overlooked caveat, is it is&nbsp;<em>not</em> enough for a party to display hostility to the constitutional order. A prohibition is only an option if the party does so in an <em>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/verfassung/parteienrecht/parteiverbot/parteiverbot-node.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active-combative, aggressive manner</a>,&rdquo;</em> as Germany&rsquo;s Ministry of the Interior puts it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Only two parties have ever been banned, a far-right one in 1952 and a far-left one in 1956. Other attempts to proscribe parties (or to be precise, the same party) have also failed twice: In 2003 and again in 2017, the Constitutional Court refused to outlaw the very far-right NPD (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands).</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why trying to ban the AfD is a bad idea in the sense that it is unlikely to work:</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65a66f9a85f54054174b49d0.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator wears a sticker on his jacket reading: &quot;Too much is too much&quot; in front of Berlin&#039;s landmark Brandenburg Gate during a protest of farmers and truck drivers, on January 15, 2024 in Berlin.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590733-germany-protest-farmers-truckers-drivers/\">‘Extremists stoking rage’: The German government seeks to downplay protesting workers' plight</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>In general, under the principle of <em>Parteienprivileg </em>(party privilege), German law fortunately makes it hard to prohibit parties. To satisfy both statutory law and interpretative precedent two key criteria must be met: A party must be proven to be fighting against Germany&rsquo;s constitutional order and also to have a real chance of success.</p>\n<p>The second criterion is why, in 2017, the Constitutional Court did not prohibit the NPD, although its program is openly extremist in a fascist register. Put simply, the Court found that the NPD is sufficiently mean but insufficiently important for a ban.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Considering the AfD, its opponents could of course argue that it has real influence and is going to have more. But the AfD&rsquo;s enemies would still have a much harder time than with the NPD: While the NPD&rsquo;s program is clear about policies that are principally irreconcilable with the German constitution, that is not the case with the AfD. In programmatic terms, it is a populist-right party (for which I, full disclosure, feel no sympathy) but it is not fundamentally challenging the German constitution. <em>If</em> a prohibition case were to rely exclusively on party programs, trying to ban the AfD would be hopeless.</p>\n<p>Yet such cases also depend on another kind of evidence. To outlaw a political party requires a large body of incriminating material of the type that only security services can collect. To put it bluntly, before you can hope to get a party proscribed, you need to spy on it &ndash; a lot&nbsp;&ndash; and including by undercover agents inside that party. That is, by the way, the real relevance of German domestic security services (in the regional <em>L&auml;nder</em> and on the federal level) officially categorizing the AfD as, in essence, <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/verfassungsschutz-darf-afd-als-verdachtsfall-beobachten-a-b4061d12-da2c-4e6c-ba24-956c837eaf53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suspect</a>. This classification says little about the chances of any prohibition procedure. What it really means is that the snoops can get to work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is this issue &ndash; the question whether the AfD is systematically lying about its real nature and intentions &ndash; that has made <a href=\"https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/neue-rechte/2024/01/10/geheimplan-remigration-vertreibung-afd-rechtsextreme-november-treffen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent revelations</a> about at least one secret meeting with other far-right representatives so resonant. Discussions there featured conspiratorial plans for expulsions, including of holders of German passports (euphemized as <em>&ldquo;remigration&rdquo;</em>), which runs directly counter to the constitution. Yet even such meetings, on their own, will not suffice for a ban.</p>\n<p>But here too, there is a downside for the proponents of a prohibition attempt. If one of the three institutions (the parliament, the federal assembly, and the government) legally empowered to do so were to actually initiate a case with the Constitutional Court, then all undercover agents would have to be de-activated at once. Indeed, it was the fact that agents were still active inside the NPD that scuppered the first prohibition attempt&nbsp;against that party in 2003.</p>\n<p>Now add the fact that such cases take years, and a paradoxical effect emerges. Starting the procedure would free the AfD from domestic security interference, at least officially, and in the sense that no evidence from any continuing spying could be used against it.</p>\n<p>The fact that prohibition cases take so long to decide also means that there is no chance to deal with the current rise of the AfD through banning it. Any ban would be far too late to have an effect on, for instance, upcoming regional and federal elections. Indeed, if a prohibition case were initiated now, it would probably only allow the AfD to profit by playing the victim card.</p>\n<p>And last but not least, there is another paradoxical effect of a prohibition attempt. If (when) it fails, in legal theory, the Constitutional Court will only find there is not enough evidence&nbsp;for a ban. But in political reality, the AfD would present such an outcome as proof that it is as clean as can be. Guess which story would be more resonant with the voters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/659ea1a485f54062e80ef9b6.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Theurer (FDP), (L) State Secretary of the Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transport, talks to protesting farmers at the Opera House in Stuttgart, southern Germany on January 6, 2024\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590400-germany-berlin-massive-protests/\">The German government is ripping off the farmers who feed the country</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>That brings us to the second angle under which trying to proscribe the AfD is a bad idea. In the improbable case of a successful prohibition, the ripple-on effects on German politics would be highly detrimental. For one thing, many voters would see the ban as foul play, an abuse of an emergency option to deal with a political competitor. And they would be right. Because even if we assume the worst about what the AfD really is and wants, we also have to apply the same skepticism to those who want to ban it and their motives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly, the issue is a textbook case of polarization. As a fresh <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article249472328/AfD-Verbot-42-Prozent-der-Deutschen-befuerworten-Verbotsverfahren.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poll</a> shows, 42% of Germans would welcome initiating a banning case. How many are against it? Also 42%. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, those politicians who make up the AfD, and the voters who side with the party, would obviously not simply disappear. On the contrary, they would seek to reorganize and start over. And the experience of prohibition would only alienate them more from the political system. And since the AfD is <em>not</em> a small party with a minuscule number of voters, that effect would be especially detrimental.</p>\n<p>Finally, the overall legitimacy &ndash; in the practical sense of principal acceptance by many citizens &ndash; of Germany&rsquo;s remaining parties, in particular those having participated in a prohibition campaign against the AfD would decline further. Ironically, the very parties claiming to be fighting incipient authoritarianism, would be perceived not only as using authoritarian tactics but as doing so for selfish and dishonest purposes. And with good reason.</p>\n<p>Is this a dilemma? Maybe. Can it be resolved by banning the AfD? No, definitely not.</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65afc43f20302729e12e46fd.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 14:50:45 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"NATO signs $1.2 billion ammo deal","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/591156-nato-ammunition-contract-ukraine/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/591156-nato-ammunition-contract-ukraine/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65afcb832030275b8b377c7c.jpg\" /> NATO has signed contracts worth $1.2 billion to purchase 220,000 155mm artillery shells <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591156-nato-ammunition-contract-ukraine/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>The US-led bloc is struggling to meet Ukraine’s demand for 155mm artillery shells</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>NATO has signed contracts worth $1.2 billion to purchase hundreds of thousands of artillery shells to replace those sent to Ukraine, the military bloc announced on Tuesday.

This particular piece was authored by Robert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, who are also not known to be alarmist.</p>\n<p>Their argument is as follows: North Korea has attempted to pursue a process of normalization with the US, particularly during the Donald Trump administration in 2018-2019, and failed after Trump walked out on the February 2019 meeting in Hanoi. After that effort failed, Pyongyang has now effectively &ldquo;given up.&rdquo; It believes it has no options left, and has continued developing its nuclear program and increasingly hardening its position, emboldened by the geopolitical context in respect to Russia and China.</p>\n<p>It might be noted early on that this assessment does not give &ldquo;hard&rdquo; evidence of North Korea pursuing such a path, and relies only on changes in Pyongyang&rsquo;s rhetoric to argue that the DPRK&rsquo;s claims are not &ldquo;bluster&rdquo; but a true reflection of its strategic position. Many things have changed since 2019 that should be taken into consideration: the Biden administration has no interest in negotiating with North Korea, a hostile Presidency has came to power in Seoul under Yoon Suk-yeol, who is pro-Japan and has abandoned the reconciliatory approach of Moon Jae-in, while the US&rsquo; confrontation against both Russia and China has given the DPRK new options to try and subvert the isolation it experienced during the era of American unipolarity.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65a9fc0320302779a950f4ad.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects unmanned underwater nuclear attack craft ‘Haeil’ in an undated photo released on March 24, 2023\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/590920-korea-underwater-nuclear-weapon/\">North Korea tests ‘underwater nuclear weapon system’</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Because of this, the US has completely lost its ability to hold North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and ballistic missile programs to account, with new sanctions now being blocked at the UN by Moscow and Beijing, and existing ones not enforced. North Korea is increasingly capable of hitting the American homeland with ICBMs. This is also making unilateral, pre-emptive military action by the US against the DPRK an increasingly unrealistic prospect. But why would this enable Kim Jong-un to pursue a war of choice against South Korea and, should he start one, would he truly have a chance of winning it?</p>\n<p>North Korea&rsquo;s entire diplomatic strategy from the 1950s onwards has always been to exert maximum leverage for itself as a small country, by creating crisis. This is the Juche ideology&rsquo;s ultimate focus on independence and sovereignty at all costs, even to its own population. To this end, the DPRK has always been provocative, whether it be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_axe_murder_incident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">killing US soldiers with axes</a>, capturing the US spy ship USS Pueblo, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67889551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shelling South Korean islands indiscriminately</a> or even sinking a South Korean warship during an exercise. In doing so it aims to force the hands of not only its enemies but also of those who are friendly to it.</p>\n<p>Recognizing its critical strategic position, Pyongyang has absolutely no problem dragging Moscow and Beijing into a crisis whether they like it or not, and was happy to cause significant trouble during the Sino-Soviet split. Therefore, in an era when China and Russia are both in a state of tensions &ndash;even confrontation&ndash; with the US, North Korea ultimately calculates opportunity for itself and extended leverage. Kim Jong-un will recognize that neither state in such a geopolitical situation could tolerate the fall of his regime and the reunification of the Korean peninsula on US-centric terms, which, for China, places an American military presence right next to its own border.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65a6778785f54014bc573044.jpg\" alt=\"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a meeting with North Korean Foreign Minister Choе Son-Hui\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/590739-us-hostile-north-korea-policies/\">US policy on North Korea destabilizing region – Lavrov</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Indeed, even though Kim Il-sung started the Korean war in 1950 and subsequently faced defeat from the US and its allies, China still saved him &ndash; and back then it was much weaker than it is now. So, would Kim Jong-un fancy his chances in unleashing a full-scale war again on the Korean peninsula on the premise China would be forced to intervene? That isn&rsquo;t beyond the realm of possibility. Does Kim want the US and China to normalize and improve ties? Of course not, because it means they will cooperate <em>against him</em> to force him to denuclearize. As for the benefits of such a reconciliation for the global economy &ndash; why would Kim care about that when his country is impoverished and isolated from said global economy anyway?</p>\n<p>So where does this leave the DPRK? It leaves Kim Jong-un with a window of time to achieve a series of geopolitical objectives and goals, in a context which is favorable to him, and therein raises the prospect of a serious escalation of tensions in some way. We&rsquo;ve already seen how similar considerations led to a full-scale war, or two now, in the Middle East. We can&rsquo;t determine whether they will lead to the outbreak of a conflict on the Korean peninsula, but it would be foolish to rule out the possibility, given the world we live in today.</p>\n<p>Multipolarity has arrived and it heralds the collapse of the US-centric, unipolar order which imposed stability by force as a one-way street. Many obviously assume the DPRK&rsquo;s Soviet-era military could be destroyed by overwhelming US and allied power in the same way Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s was in 1991 and 2003, but that was a different world. Here, you have a nuclear capable DPRK that has overseas backers who, while never wanting such a conflict, can&rsquo;t afford to see the state fail. North Korea has made attempts at peace but met with America&rsquo;s absolute unwillingness to compromise &ndash; therefore, what options does Kim have left to deal with South Korea?</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65af130185f5400bf7713bd9.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 01:15:52 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"Washington demands probe into Palestinian teen’s death","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/591115-american-palestinian-teen-shot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/591115-american-palestinian-teen-shot/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.01/thumbnail/65af0dac203027427f748701.jpg\" /> The State Department has spoken up about the fatal shooting of Tawfiq Ajaq, who grew up near New Orleans before moving to the West Bank <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/591115-american-palestinian-teen-shot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>American citizen Tawfiq Ajaq was fatally shot in the West Bank</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>The US State Department on Monday urged Israel to investigate the death of a 17-year-old American citizen in the West Bank last week.</p>\n<p>Tawfiq Ajaq, 17, was fatally shot on Friday near the village of al-Mazraa Al-Sharqiya, northeast of Ramallah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;We have called for an urgent investigation to determine the circumstance of his death,&rdquo;</em> State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters at a briefing in Washington on Monday.</p>\n<p>The US is <em>&ldquo;devastated about the killing&rdquo;</em> and is continuing to <em>&ldquo;engage closely with the government of Israel to ascertain as much information as possible,&rdquo;</em> Patel said.

The long-term ruler of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was deposed, and the radical elements in Sinai started rearing their heads.
