These tools and infrastructure are then used to conduct ransomware attacks by another party who is not directly connected to the creation of the malware.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using RaaS, a person with even basic IT knowledge can launch ransomware attacks without developing the malware or handling the complex infrastructures.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How RaaS Works?</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RaaS operates on a similar principle to software-as-a-service (SaaS) but with a malicious intent. In SaaS services, users are able access software applications &amp; services remotely over the internet. Service provider develops and maintains the total infrastructure, user just pays the fee required to use the service. Usually this fee is collected in the form of subscription based fees.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RaaS operates on the same principle. Here, the developers of the software are commonly known as &#8220;</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">operators</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; but can have different names like leader, developers, or system administrators as well. They are the brain behind the whole operation as they develop and maintain the ransomware software along with the associated infrastructure. RaaS developers  create malware with a high chance of penetration success and a low chance of discovery. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, this package is offered to other less technically skilled cybercriminals who lack the brain to develop such sophisticated tools but are interested in carrying out ransomware attacks. This second party is known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affiliates</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Affiliates can sign up and obtain access to the ransomware toolset. Both the operators and affiliates can perform in groups and perform cyber attacks in harmony. For a successful ransomware attack, the affiliates then payback an amount to the operators as the “service charge” thus the business continues.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some special cases, a perpetrator group can have strong penetration testing teams but may lack the necessary ransomware software. RaaS model works as a blessing as they could just work as affiliates and use existing ransomware tools to compromise a target. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>A workflow of how RaaS Model Works</strong></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-8955 size-full\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/How-RaaS-Model-Works.jpg\" alt=\"RaaS model workflow\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RaaS and Rise of Ransomware Attacks</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it lowers the entry barrier for cybercriminals and enables less technical individuals to participate in malicious activities, RaaS has contributed hugely to the proliferation of ransomware attacks in recent years.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By utilizing RaaS, affiliates can launch ransomware attacks without needing to develop the malware themselves or handle the complexities of infrastructure management. The operators behind RaaS platforms typically take a percentage of the ransom payments collected by the affiliates as a commission.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Stay Safe</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like other malicious activity, the RaaS event will probably continue to occur and has no straight-up remedy.

Everyone is excited with the new possibility and using it with a lot of enthusiasm. However, criminals have extended the “use” to “misuse” and in the cyberworld <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/hackers-chatgpt-phishing-malware-domain-scams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">we can already see the scammers are utilizing the new technology</a> to run even more malicious activities. In this article, we will look into some examples where AI tools are used to scam people and discuss some ways to be safe from falling into such traps. Let’s get into it. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8928\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ChatGpt-blog.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" /></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Usage of AI &amp; ChatGPT by Cybercriminals</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, it is important to understand that tools like ChatGPT which are powered by artificial intelligence do not create cyberthreats on their own. In fact there are several  professional AI <a href=\"https://www.saasaspire.com/blog/best-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Chatbots</a> are helping grow businesses to the next level. It’s the human cybercriminals who use, rather misuse, AI as a tool to launch cyber attacks more efficiently and effectively. Let’s look at some ways AI can be used to create cyberthreats:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Automated Attacks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: ChatGPT can write codes quite efficiently and this efficiency is only increasing day by day. It can be used to write scripts to create automated attacks that scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them. Which in turn can lead to more frequent and widespread attacks that are harder to detect and defend against.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Self Changing Malwares</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: How </span><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/types-of-malware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a malware</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is prevented is, when the malicious intent is discovered by an operating system (like Windows) it will be red flagged and patches will be distributed that stops that particular malware from causing any future harm. However, with the power of AI, now it’s possible to create such malware that changes itself ever so slightly to bypass the security firewall and continue to wreak havoc. So, AI can be used to create more sophisticated malware that is better at evading detection and spreading throughout networks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Benefits in Social Engineering:</b> <a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-social-engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social engineering attacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can cause significant financial and reputational damage to individuals and organizations. Apart from automating the manipulation process, identifying vulnerabilities in human psychology, AI can be used to create fake social media profiles or chatbots to create convincing personas or scenarios that can be used to trick users into revealing sensitive information.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Phishing Email Creation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Even before the existence of tools like ChatGPT, more than 60% of cyber attacks were somehow initiated by a phishing email. Back then, almost every convincing email had to be human written. Now, with the power of AI, it has almost become a child’s play to create highly convincing phishing emails that are more likely to trick victims into giving up sensitive information.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The image below is an example of how ChatGPT can be used in tricking email creation</span>. It only took seconds to write this mail with AI. It requires only a bit of tweaking and it’s ready to go as a phishing bait.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8927\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-test.jpg\" alt=\"ChatGPT Phishing Email Test\" width=\"793\" height=\"857\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Deep Fakes Videos and AI Generated Image:</strong> AI can now create deep fake videos that can be used to spread misinformation or impersonate individuals. While videos are still a bit on the primary level, with powerful tools like MidjourneyAI it’s possible to create a pitch-perfect image which can trick even to most of the veteran human eyes. Recently such an event created quite a fuss worldwide when </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/artificial-intelligence-photo-competition-won-rejected-award-ai-boris-eldagsen-sony-world-photography-awards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a photographer submitted an AI generated photo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a photography contest and actually won the competition!</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Way to Safeguard From AI Generated Scams</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the sole purpose of AI generated text is that they appear authentic and convincing, AI-generated scams can often be difficult to detect. However, there are certain things you can do to protect yourself:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Avoid unsolicited messages</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Be wary of messages or emails from people you don&#8217;t know, especially if they are offering you something that seems too good to be true. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Grow The Habit of Verifying Sources</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Check the sender&#8217;s email address and verify if it&#8217;s legitimate. Scammers often use a slightly different email address that looks similar to the real one, so the habit of checking the authenticity of an email domain can save you a fortune.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Check the content, thoroughly</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you receive an email with a link or an attachment, don&#8217;t click on it without verifying the content. Hover over the link to see the URL, and scan the attachment with anti-virus software. Be wary of any malicious links.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Usage of two-factor authentication</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Enable two-factor authentication on your accounts to prevent hackers from accessing your information even if they manage to get your password.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Always Update your </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>software</b>: As we’ve learnt earlier that operating systems and software are always evolving to face the cyberthreats, it’s your duty to Keep the computer and smartphone operating systems and antivirus software updated to protect against known security vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Report suspicious activity</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you receive a suspicious message or email and can’t decide the authenticity for yourself, report it to the relevant authorities or contact the company it claims to be from to verify if it&#8217;s legitimate. This is beneficial in two ways, first, you get to be sure of the authenticity, there is no one stopping you to go forward if it’s a legitimate email.

It is the most precious thing any institution or individual can probably have. However, as things turn into digital, the probability of data breach or data loss is also eminent. And in such an event, only the habit of data backup can save the day. Let’s get to know more about data backups and their importance in cybersecurity</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of Backup Day</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know there is actually a day named </span><b>Data Backup Day</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? It’s a yearly observance that reminds people to back up their important data regularly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of this day is quite an interesting one. The initial idea for a World Backup Day originated from a Reddit thread where a user suggested that there should be a day dedicated to reminding people about the importance of backing up their data. The suggestion received a lot of attention and support, and the first World Backup Day was celebrated back on March 31, 2011.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, </span><b>World Backup Day has become an annual event, with the aim of encouraging individuals and businesses to take the necessary steps to protect their valuable data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The day is celebrated by hosting events, sharing tips and best practices for data backup, and raising awareness about the importance of data protection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some confusions as different parts of the world observe similar days like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Backup Day</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on different dates. However, keeping the date aside, the message of Data Backup Day remains the same – to encourage individuals and businesses to take proactive measures to protect their data from loss, theft, and other forms of damage.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8920\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-1-06.jpg\" alt=\"Backup day\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Data Loss Occurs</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand the importance of data backup it’s required to know why data loss occurs in the first place. Various reasons can contribute initiating an event resulting a data loss, let’s take a brief look:</span></p>\n<p><b>Hardware failure</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This is one of the most common reasons for data loss. Hardware failures can occur due to various reasons such as hard drive crashes, power outages, physical damage to storage devices, etc. This kind of damage can happen anytime as all the electrical devices are prone to sudden damage without any prior notice.</span></p>\n<p><b>Human error</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Data loss can occur due to human error too. Accidental deletion, formatting the wrong drive, overwriting files, mishandling the storage media are some of the common mistakes that can lead to data loss.</span></p>\n<p><b>Natural disasters</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Though not that common, natural disasters such as floods, fires, earthquakes, and hurricanes can damage the hardware storing data and cause data loss.</span></p>\n<p><b>Theft or loss of devices</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you do not have the habit of backing up data regularly, losing or theft of laptops, phones, or other storage devices can lead to data loss.</span></p>\n<p><b>Software issues</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Apart from faulty hardware issues, data can be lost due to software issues too. Viruses, malware, bugs, and software crashes can corrupt or delete precious data.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cyber attacks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Cybercrime is the talk of the modern era. Most of the big companies and organizations are always under the continuous threat of data breach by the cyber criminals. Hackers can steal, delete or corrupt data by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks and wreak havoc to the entire system.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of Data Backup</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data backup is essential because it helps protect valuable information against data loss or breach, which can occur due to various reasons discussed above. Let’s look at some reasons why data backup is essential to have:</span></p>\n<p><b>Protection against data loss</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Data loss can occur due to various reasons, and it can be devastating for businesses and individuals. Data backup helps to protect against data loss by creating a copy of the data that can be restored in case the original data is lost.</span></p>\n<p><b>Business continuity</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In case of a disaster or a system failure, data backup ensures that business operations can continue without interruption. This is critical for businesses that rely heavily on data and cannot afford to lose access to it for an extended period.</span></p>\n<p><b>Compliance with regulations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Many businesses are required by law to backup their data, especially those that deal with sensitive information such as healthcare, finance, and legal industries.</span></p>\n<p><b>Improved data management</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Regular data backup can help businesses manage their data more efficiently. It can also help identify data that is no longer needed or duplicate data that can be deleted, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient data management process.</span></p>\n<p><b>Peace of mind</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Knowing that data is backed up and can be restored in case of data loss can provide peace of mind to individuals and businesses alike.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different Methods of Backing Up Your Data</span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8921 size-full\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-2-02.jpg\" alt=\"Different methods of data backup\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data can be backed up in various of methods, let’s take a look at a few of them</span></p>\n<p><b>Full Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A complete backup of all the data on a system or device. It includes all files, folders, and system data. Full backups can take a long time to complete and require a large amount of storage space too.</span></p>\n<p><b>Incremental Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: An incremental backup only backs up data that has changed since the last backup, whether it&#8217;s a full or incremental backup. This type of backup is faster and requires less storage space than a full backup.</span></p>\n<p><b>Differential Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A differential backup also backs up data that has changed since the last backup, but it includes all the changes since the last full backup. Differential backups take longer than incremental backups but require less storage space than a full backup.</span></p>\n<p><b>Mirror Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A mirror backup creates an exact copy of the data being backed up, including all files and folders. This type of backup is useful when you need to create a duplicate of a system or device.</span></p>\n<p><b>Snapshot Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A snapshot backup captures the state of a system or device at a specific point in time. This type of backup is useful for systems or devices that are constantly changing, such as databases or virtual machines.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cloud Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A cloud backup stores data in a remote server over the internet. This type of backup provides a reliable off-site backup solution that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hybrid Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A hybrid backup combines on-premises backups with cloud backups to create a comprehensive backup solution. This type of backup provides the benefits of both local and cloud backups, including fast backup and restore times and off-site data protection.</span></p>\n<p><b>Local Backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There could be two types of local backups. Firstly, there are external hard drives, a very popular backup option due to its usability, availability and storage options. Data can be transferred effortlessly as well. Then there are removable devices like CD / DVD roms or USB flash drives or memory sticks. They are all portable and a practical way to store data. However, removable drives have ratherlow storage options. In addition, both types are prone to physical damage. They can break over time, lost or stolen.</span></p>\n<p><b>FTP backup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol used to transfer files over the internet. This could also be used in data backup. An FTP server could be used to store backup files over the internet. The server is usually located in a different place than the data which is being backed up. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Backup Recovery Methods</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of recovering backed-up data depends on the backup method used. If you know the method used for backing up data then you also have ample idea how to recover it. Let’s look at some steps how to recover</span></p>\n<p><b>Identify the location</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Determine where your backup data is stored. If it’s in a cloud-based backup service, log in to your account to access your backup data. If an external hard drive storage was used, connecting the drive to a computer or any other readable device should be enough to restore it.</span></p>\n<p><b>What data needs to be restored</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Next step is to identify the files or folders needed to be restored. For example, if you&#8217;re restoring data due to a hardware failure or data corruption, you may need to restore all the data from your backup.</span></p>\n<p><b>Verifying the restored data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Once the data is restored, verify that it is complete and accurate. Check that all the files you expected to be restored are present and that they are not corrupted.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to test your backup and recovery process regularly to ensure that it works correctly and that you can recover your data in case of an emergency.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/importance-of-data-backup\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">World Backup Day: Why Data Backups are Important in Cybersecurity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">REVE Antivirus</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/importance-of-data-backup/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"What is Social Engineering and How Cyber Criminals Use It","link":"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-social-engineering","comments":"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-social-engineering#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Shahriar Rahman"},"pubDate":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 10:00:45 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"BD English"},{"#cdata-section":"Blog"},{"#cdata-section":"English"},{"#cdata-section":"India"},{"#cdata-section":"Best Cyber Security Tips"},{"#cdata-section":"cyber security tips"},{"#cdata-section":"cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"phishing"},{"#cdata-section":"social engineering"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/?p=8908"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Social engineering is a highly effective technique for cybercriminals as it targets the weakest link in any security system: human beings.

Malwares is their weapon of destruction, once it enters the victim’s machine it takes care of the crime. However, to get the initial entry, the perpetrator carries out some tricks (i.e. phishing, baiting, tailgating etc.). All of these methods are often collectively called social engineering. In this article we will discuss more about it.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Social Engineering &#8211; Defined.</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social engineering, the term is often used in the context of cybersecurity, where attackers use techniques to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or steal sensitive information.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, it refers to the</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Use of psychological manipulation and deception to influence individuals or groups of people to divulge confidential information, perform actions or take decisions that are not in their best interest. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social engineering attacks may happen in different forms, such as phishing emails, pretexting, baiting, or tailgating, and can target anyone from individuals to large corporations. The success of a social engineering attack often relies on exploiting the trust, fear, or lack of knowledge of the victim. It is mostly used by cybercriminals to circumvent security protocols and gain access to confidential information or networks.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Most Common Ways of Social Engineering Attacks</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social engineering attacks often are a collective method of several techniques. Here are some of the most common ways of such attacks:</span></p>\n<p><b>Phishing</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Phishing is a very common name in the world of cybersecurity. It is also the most common type of social engineering attack. Here attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from reputable sources (such as banks, social media, or other trusted organizations) to trick victims into clicking on a link or downloading a malicious attachment. Once the attachment is opened, malware makes its way to the computer or the device.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pretexting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In this type of social engineering attack, the attacker creates a false scenario or pretext to convince victims to reveal sensitive information or perform actions they wouldn&#8217;t normally do. This approach requires the attacker to interact with the victim more proactively. The exploit follows once they’ve convinced the victim that they are legitimate.</span></p>\n<p><b>Baiting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Baiting is a phishing attack in a different form. It involves enticing victims with a reward or incentive to click on a link or download a file, which then infects their computer with malware.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spear Phishing:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing, where attackers create personalized messages to trick specific individuals into divulging sensitive information or clicking on a link.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tailgating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Tailgating is a physical social engineering attack, where an attacker follows an authorized person into a restricted area, bypassing security protocols. Pretexting can play a role here too.</span></p>\n<p><b>Impersonation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Impersonation is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker pretends to be someone else, such as an executive or IT support, to gain access to sensitive information or systems.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watering Hole:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a watering hole attack, attackers target a specific group of people by infecting a popular website or online community they are known to visit with malware.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important to note that these are just a few examples of social engineering attacks, and attackers can use a variety of other tactics to manipulate their victims.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Why Social Engineering is Cyber Criminal’s Favorite</b></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8910\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/a0dcbd09f2.jpg\" alt=\"dangers of social engineering\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is mostly because it can be a highly effective way to trick people into giving up sensitive information or taking actions that can compromise their security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals use social engineering to exploit human psychology and behavior. The actions they take lead the victim to reveal sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, or click on a link that installs malware on their device. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The social engineering technique is even more popular among cybercriminals because it can be relatively easy to execute when compared to more technically advanced attacks. It requires little or no technical expertise, investment, and completely relies on the attacker&#8217;s ability to persuade and manipulate their victims.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Dangers of Social Engineering</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dangers of social engineering are significant and can have serious consequences. They include:</span></p>\n<p><b>Data breaches:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineering attacks can </span><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/how-to-prevent-data-breach\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lead to data breaches</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that result in the theft of sensitive information, such as personal or financial data. This information can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities.</span></p>\n<p><b>Financial loss:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineering attacks can trick people into giving away their financial information, such as credit card details or bank account passwords. Cybercriminals can then use this information to steal money from their victims.</span></p>\n<p><b>Malware infections:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineering attacks can also be used to distribute malware, such as viruses, Trojans, or </span><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/bd/mitigate-ransomware-attack-loss\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ransomware</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Once installed on a victim&#8217;s computer, the malware can steal data, damage files, or even take control of the system.</span></p>\n<p><b>Reputation damage:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineering attacks can also damage a person&#8217;s or a company&#8217;s reputation. For example, if a hacker gains access to a company&#8217;s social media account and posts inappropriate content, it could damage the company&#8217;s image and cause a loss of trust among customers.</span></p>\n<p><b>Psychological impact:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineering attacks can have a psychological impact on victims. For example, victims may feel violated, embarrassed, or angry after falling for a social engineering attack. They may also experience anxiety or stress as they try to rectify the situation and prevent further damage.</span></p>\n<h3><b>How to Prevent Social Engineering Attacks</b></h3>\n<p><b>Be wary of unsolicited requests:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don&#8217;t share sensitive information, no matter who or how asking for it. Information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details, do not share with anyone.</span></p>\n<p><b>Verify the identity of the person requesting information:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always thoroughly verify the identity of the person requesting information, especially if it&#8217;s through an email or phone call. Check their email address or caller ID, and if in doubt, hang up the call or skip the email.</span></p>\n<p><b>Use strong passwords:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ensure you use strong passwords that are not easily guessable by others. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</span></p>\n<p><b>Regularly update your software:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All the famous software regularly push updates and patches to safeguard and provide a smoother experience. Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches and software updates to minimize vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p><b>Be mindful of what you share online:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Avoid sharing sensitive information online, such as your full name, address, and date of birth as they could be used to initiate a full scale social engineering attack.</span></p>\n<p><b>Educate yourself: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As social engineering is targeted towards human vulnerability, it’s very important to learn about the different types of social engineering attacks and how to recognize them. This knowledge will help you identify potential attacks and avoid falling victim to them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Use two-factor authentication:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to social engineering attacks. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8914\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-2-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Social engineering is a highly effective technique for cybercriminals because it targets the weakest link in any security system: human beings.</strong></span> Even with the best security measures in place, it is difficult to protect against a well-executed social engineering attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To protect against social engineering attacks, individuals and organizations should be vigilant, educate themselves and their employees about these tactics, and implement security measures such as two-factor authentication and firewalls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, social engineering attacks can be devastating for individuals and organizations alike.

Some examples of sensitive PII include social security numbers, financial account numbers, health records, biometric data, and login credentials.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Non-sensitive PII</span>, on the other hand, is information that alone or in combination with other information </span><b><i>cannot directly identify</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a particular individual or pose a significant risk if disclosed. Examples of non-sensitive PII include demographic information such as age, gender, race, occupation, or educational level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While both sensitive and non-sensitive PII require protection, sensitive PII requires more stringent security measures due to the potential harm it could cause if it falls into the wrong hands. Organizations and individuals must take extra precautions to ensure that sensitive PII is encrypted, stored securely, and transmitted only over secure channels. Non-sensitive PII may still require some level of protection, but the risks associated with its disclosure are generally less severe.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can PII be Compromised ?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal identifiable information (PII) can be stolen in a variety of ways, including:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/top-5-security-tactics-safeguard-business-phishing-attacks\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><b>Phishing:</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is the most common method of stealing PII. Phishing attacks use fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick victims into giving up sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.</span></p>\n<p><b>Malware:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Malware, such as viruses, Trojans, and spyware, can be used to steal PII. Once a </span><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/types-of-malware\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">malware infects a device</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it can collect information from the device, such as keystrokes, screenshots, and files.</span></p>\n<p><b>Social engineering</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This is a technique that hackers use to manipulate victims into giving up their personal information. Social engineering can be done through phone calls, emails, or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or government agency.</span></p>\n<p><b>Data breaches:</b><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/how-to-prevent-data-breach\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Data breaches occur</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when hackers gain unauthorized access to a company&#8217;s database or server and steal the PII of customers or employees.</span></p>\n<p><b>Physical theft:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Physical theft of devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets can also lead to the theft of PII if the device contains sensitive information that is not properly secured.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Safeguard PII</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies have to collect PII for various reasons. However, as we’ve seen in the past, due to different data breaches, personal information collected by companies are often lost and fall into the hands of malicious parties. So, it’s the collector’s responsibility to ensure the safety of collected personal information. Here’s how to safeguard the collected PII </span></p>\n<p><b>Identify and classify PII:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The first step is to identify all the PII your organization collects, processes, stores, or transmits. Then classify them based on their sensitivity and level of risk.</span></p>\n<p><b>Implement access controls:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Implement access controls to restrict access to PII to only those who need it to perform their job duties. Use role-based access control (RBAC), two-factor authentication (2FA), and encryption to ensure that only authorized users can access PII.</span></p>\n<p><b>Secure storage and transmission:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> PII should be stored and transmitted securely. Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. Implement strong password policies, firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monitor and audit:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Monitor and audit PII access and use to detect and prevent unauthorized access or misuse. Implement logging and alerting systems to track PII usage, access attempts, and suspicious activities.</span></p>\n<p><b>Train employees:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Train employees on PII handling, security policies, and best practices. Educate them on how to detect and report phishing attacks, social engineering, and other cyber threats.</span></p>\n<p><b>Dispose of PII securely:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> PII should be disposed of securely when no longer needed. Use secure data destruction methods such as shredding, wiping, or degaussing to ensure that PII cannot be recovered.</span></p>\n<p><b>Stay compliant:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ensure that your organization complies with all relevant data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following these steps can definitely help safeguard PII and protect your organization from cyber threats and data breaches.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PII vs Personal Data</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and personal data are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings and legal implications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While both terms used to describe information that can be used to identify an individual, PII is a specific type of personal data that is considered sensitive and requires special protection.</span></p>\n<p><b>Personal data refers to </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. This can include things like a person&#8217;s name, address, date of birth, email address, social media posts, location data, and more. Personal data can be used for a variety of purposes, including marketing, research, and personalization of services.</span></p>\n<p><b>PII</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, on the other hand, </span><b>refers to specific types of personal data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be used to identify an individual, such as a social security number, driver&#8217;s license number, passport number, financial account numbers, and biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition. PII is considered more sensitive than other personal data because it can be used for identity theft or fraud.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, while all PII is personal data, not all personal data is considered PII. Both types of information need to be handled with care and protected from unauthorized access or misuse. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to protect PII as it can be used to commit identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities. Both the data collector and the person should be responsible for safeguarding it.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/things-to-know-about-personally-identifiable-information-pii\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Things To Know About Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">REVE Antivirus</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/things-to-know-about-personally-identifiable-information-pii/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"What is Data Breach?

No exception on the most valuable asset of this modern world either. Yes, <strong>in this data driven world, information or data is the most lucrative fruit that the cybercriminals are after</strong>. In this article we will know about data breach, how it occurs, steps as well as types of data theft and more.  </span></p>\n<h3><b>What is Data Breach</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start with the basic question, <strong>how do we define a Data Breach</strong>? </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short &#8211; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a data breach is an event where some individual or institution’s data is taken over (and often misused) by some third party without the consent of its respective owners.</span></span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is an incident where confidential, sensitive, or protected information is accessed or disclosed without authorization. This can happen to individuals, organizations, or even government agencies. The information that is stolen or exposed can vary widely and may include personal information, such as social security numbers, credit card details, email addresses, login credentials, medical records, and financial data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Data breaches can occur in a variety of ways</strong>, such as through hacking, <a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/types-of-malware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">malware attacks</a>, phishing scams, physical theft of hardware or storage devices, or insider threats. The consequences of a data breach can be severe, and can result in financial loss, identity theft, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Steps of Data Breach</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The steps of a data breach can vary depending on the specific circumstances, but generally include the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Initial Access:</span></strong> The first step of a data breach is gaining access to the target system or network. This can be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in software, using stolen credentials, or through phishing attacks.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Reconnaissance</strong>:</span> Once the attacker has gained access, they will typically conduct reconnaissance to gather information about the target system and identify the data they are interested in. This may involve searching for specific files or databases, or scanning the network for other vulnerable systems.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Data Exfiltration</span>:</strong> The attacker will then attempt to exfiltrate the stolen data from the target system or network. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as copying files to an external device or sending them to a remote server controlled by the attacker.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Covering Tracks</strong>:</span> After the data has been exfiltrated, the attacker may attempt to cover their tracks by deleting logs and other evidence of their activities. This can make it more difficult for investigators to identify the source of the breach.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>What To Do In An Event Of Data Breach?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data breach may be detected through various means, such as monitoring for unusual activity on the network or through reports from affected users. Below steps should be taken immediately to appease the situation as much as possible</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blocking Unauthorized Access</span>:</strong> The attacker may use the stolen data to gain further unauthorized access to other systems or networks. This can allow them to continue stealing data or to cause further damage. It should be an immediate task to block any further unauthorized access.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Containment</span>:</strong> Once a data breach has been detected, steps should be taken to contain the damage in its current position. This may involve disconnecting affected systems from the network, resetting passwords, or blocking access from certain IP addresses.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Investigation</span></strong>: A thorough investigation should be conducted to determine the extent of the breach, identify the data that was stolen, and determine the source of the attack.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Notification</span></strong>: Affected parties, such as customers or employees whose personal data was compromised, must be notified of the breach and advised on steps they can take to protect themselves.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Remediation</span></strong>: Steps should be taken to remediate any vulnerabilities that were exploited in the breach, such as patching software or strengthening access controls.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>How to Prevent Data Theft?</b></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8515 size-full\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/small-sized-2.jpg\" alt=\"Investment on cybersecurity\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/small-sized-2.jpg 600w, https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/small-sized-2-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data theft is a serious concern for individuals, businesses, and organizations alike. It can lead to financial losses, damage to reputation, and even legal implications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent data breaches, it is essential to implement strong cybersecurity measures, such as using complex passwords, regularly updating software and security patches, encrypting sensitive data, limiting access to information on a need-to-know basis, and providing regular training to employees and users on how to recognize and avoid cyber threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some steps in detail that you can take to prevent data theft:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Using strong passwords:</span></strong> Weak passwords are one of the easiest ways for hackers to gain access to your data. Use complex passwords that include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Two-factor authentication:</span></strong> Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, such as a text message or a fingerprint, in addition to their password.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Data encryption</span>:</strong> Encrypting sensitive data such as credit card information, social security numbers, and personal health information can help protect it from unauthorized access</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Limited access to data</span>:</strong> Only grant access to sensitive data to those who need it for their job. This helps prevent accidental exposure or intentional theft.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Keeping up to date:</span></strong> Regularly update your computer&#8217;s operating system, applications, and security software to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Employees training on data security</span>:</strong> Educate your employees on data security best practices, such as not clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Network activity monitoring:</span></strong> Keep an eye on network activity and look for signs of suspicious behavior, such as large data transfers or unauthorized access attempts.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Using a virtual private network (VPN):</strong> </span>A VPN can help protect your data when accessing public Wi-Fi networks by encrypting your internet traffic.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data is everywhere, from our brain cells to the cellphone we hold in our hands, everything is filled with data. And we constantly share these data with one another as they are very very important to our everyday communication. However, that is only true when they are shared with the right authority. Personal or sensitive data in the wrong hands could be devastating. A collaborative effort should be implemented to prevent any types of data-theft and the overall security of data. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/how-to-prevent-data-breach\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">What is Data Breach?

However, as the day progresses, more and more new techniques evolve. Vishing is one of them, it’s phishing done or initiated over a voice call. Let’s know more about this and ways to stay safe. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vishing vs Phishing</span></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8869\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vecteezy_confused-man-with-question-mark-concept-flat-illustration_.jpg\" alt=\"FAQ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vishing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">phishing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are both types of social engineering attacks and use many of the same tactics, the main difference between them is the medium used to perform the attacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, vishing uses the phone to perform an attack. The attacker will call the victim or trick the victim into calling them, and verbally attempt to trick them into doing something. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishers, on the other hand, use electronic, text-based forms of communication to perform their attacks. While email is the most common and well-known phishing medium, attackers can also use text messages (also called </span><a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-smishing\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smishing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), corporate communications apps (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.), messaging apps (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, etc.), or social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) to perform their attacks.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different Types of Vishing Scams</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vishing attacks can be as varied as phishing attacks. Some of the most common pretexts used in vishing include:</span></p>\n<p><b>Account related Issue:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Someone may pretend to be from a bank or other service provider claiming that an issue exists with a customer’s account. They will then ask for personal information to “verify the customer’s identity.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Fake Government Representative:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A vishing attack may include an attacker masquerading as a representative of a government agency, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Social Security Administration (SSA). These attacks are typically designed to steal personal information or trick the victim into sending money to the attacker.</span></p>\n<p><b>Fake Tech Support:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social engineers may pretend to be tech support from large and well-known companies like Microsoft or Google. These attackers will pretend to help to fix an issue on the victim’s computer or browser but actually install malware.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Recognize It’s a Vishing Call?</span></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8707 size-large\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stuck-940x470-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"personal cybersecurity tips\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stuck-940x470-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stuck-940x470-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stuck-940x470-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/stuck-940x470.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s sometimes difficult for people to tell when they are being vished. Victims often don&#8217;t realize the helpful person on the other end of the phone is conning them until after they&#8217;ve handed over their credentials. However, there are some warning signs that can help them spot potential frauds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases,</span><b> callers are self-appointed experts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or authorities in their fields. They can masquerade as computer technicians, bankers, police, or even victims themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if these callers are legitimate, it shouldn&#8217;t be difficult to authenticate their professional affiliation with a simple phone call. If they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t provide the information necessary to verify their identity, they can&#8217;t be trusted. If they do provide contact info, it&#8217;s still important to independently verify the legitimacy by using an official public phone number to call the organization in question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it&#8217;s tempting to give in under pressure, </span><b>a frantic sense of urgency is a huge red flag</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Users should take a couple of deep breaths, and then write down any information the person provides on the call without providing any details of their own.

People who believe an issue could be authentic should use another phone to call a publicly acknowledged phone number.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preventing Vishing Attacks</span></h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8416 size-full\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/computer-1591018_1920-small.jpg\" alt=\"computer unlocked\" width=\"600\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/computer-1591018_1920-small.jpg 600w, https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/computer-1591018_1920-small-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it’s somewhat easier to prevent phishing attacks using technology, for vishing it’s not the same as it takes place in a direct call with the user. So, prevention and awareness is the key thing here. As a person you should be aware of these scams and be protective about your personal data. Here are some advices to follow-</span></p>\n<p><b>Never Give Out Personal Data:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vishing attacks are commonly designed to trick the target into handing over personal information that can be used for fraud or in other attacks. Never provide a password, multi-factor authentication (MFA) number, financial data, or similar information over the phone. Never ever no matter what!</span></p>\n<p><b>Always Verify Phone Numbers:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vishers will call while pretending to be from a legitimate organization. Before giving any personal data or doing anything that the attacker says, get the caller’s name and call them back by using the official number from the company website. If the caller tries to talk you out of doing so, it’s probably a scam.</span></p>\n<p><b>Beware of Gift Cards Trick:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vishers will commonly demand payment for unpaid taxes or other fees in gift cards or prepaid Visa cards. No legitimate organizations will request a gift card or prepaid credit as payment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Never Provide Remote Computer Access:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vishers may request remote access to your computer to “remove malware” or fix some other issue, specially to some unknown unrecognized unauthorized person. Never provide access to your computer to anyone except verified members of the IT department.</span></p>\n<p><b>Report Suspected Incidents:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Vishers commonly will try to use the same scam on multiple different targets. Report any suspected vishing attack to IT or the authorities so that they can take action to protect others against it.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-a-vishing-attack\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">What is a Vishing Attack?

Everyone is trying to get an idea where to invest, what to look for in a modern endpoint security software. However, while focusing on the rather technical terms and trying to solve the conundrum, many often forgot to look at the common, basic features a cybersecurity should offer. Lets’ not do that, let’s focus on the basics before diving deep into the complicated, personalized features. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the top 10 common mistakes made while evaluating an endpoint security product</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ignoring Customer Reviews</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common mistake we often make while making a decision for our enterprise is, we tend to not take into consideration the reviews of the previous users. Who else than the people who have used the product beforehand, can tell you better about the product? Check the review &amp; ratings, go through customer feedback, try to grasp what the market is saying about the vendor and solution.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      2. Not Thoroughly Reviewing Service Provider Organization’s History</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not always true that more time in business always results in a better product. However, it’s proven that a seasoned organization tends to have more credibility and capability. Be sure to look for that credibility in your vendor. Experience is not something you can buy overnight, you have to gradually gather it. A stable, successful product will have that more often than not. A credible vendor or service provider will almost always provide top class customer experience and could <a href=\"https://www.saasaspire.com/blog/hospitality-vs-customer-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">understand the thin line between customer service and hospitality</a>.  </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      3. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Checking Quality Support Ability &amp; Promptness Beforehand</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, the seller &#8211; buyer relationship is maintained till the sale is made for the most types of products. Typical products do not require prolonged support after a sale is made. However, unlike other sectors, in the world of cybersecurity solutions, the customer-vendor relationship begins once the sale is done! After sales service and support is an essential part here. Is the cybersecurity solution able to provide prompt support? How is their support structure? Will that fulfill your requirements? Make sure you check on that before taking any decision.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      4. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Considering Ease Of Updates And Rollouts</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cyber world is changing rapidly. To cope up with the trend and ever-evolving cyber threats, an admin needs to keep all the machines updated to the latest security patch on a regular basis. Make sure to consider the ease of rolling out new updates and initiatives in the solution you are choosing. Especially if the solution has remote deployment and update features.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      5. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Considering Ease Of Integration</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An endpoint is any connected device to the network. That includes mobile devices, desktops, laptops, servers, and IoT devices. The solution you are choosing, can it be integrated to all of them? Compromising only a single endpoint is often enough for a full scale attack. So, you need to keep secure all the endpoints and that brings out the importance of the ease of integration.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      6. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forgetting About Own Specific Requirements</span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8874\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1056305928-checklist-600x400-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power of a smart sales pitch is, it can often baffle you with the shiny features and make you forget what you’re looking for in a new solution in the first place. Don’t be perplexed, choose a solution that addresses all of your initial requirements.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      7. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing To Properly Judge Organizations’ Current Situation</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approaching blindly and failing to consider the number of users and the number of endpoints needed to protect.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to set a realistic budget. </span>Most expensive solution doesn’t necessarily mean the best solution. The one that suits best with your requirements, does.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to pinpoint the biggest cybersecurity risks. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas Data Loss might be the biggest security threat for Government or healthcare sector, for other industries, DOS attack or Malware, Ransomware attack might be the most problematic. Precautions should be taken likewise.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      8. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Aware Of Various Product Types</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, there is the endpoint protection platform (EPP), a reactive solution and Endpoint detection and response (EDR), a proactive solution. There are other solutions like Endpoint Cloud (EPC) and Endpoint Security (EPS). Before taking any decision, the awareness of various product types should be there.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      9. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Misconception That Small Organizations Would Not Attract Hackers</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, cybercriminals assume that SMBs have small budgets and less robust cybersecurity, which makes smaller businesses easier targets for cyberattacks. So, if you are an owner of a small business, do not make the mistake of running your business without proper cybersecurity protection.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      10. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sticking To Only One Option</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of options in the modern cybersecurity solutions market. Comparing enough options or vendors in the market is always a good idea.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing the <a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">right cybersecurity solution</a> for your organization can be a challenging task.

And, as the mobile phone has intertwined with everyday life, it has become a top target for the cybercriminals too. As a result, a lot of mobiles are getting hacked more often than not. In this article we will tap into some basic  </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How a mobile can be compromised?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be many different ways a phone can get compromised. Most common way is phishing, where you click a link containing malicious software. You inadvertently click a suspicious link and go one step closer to being hacked. Downloading malicious apps is another way your phone can be hacked. And another way how your phone can be compromised is when you access an unauthorized wifi network. The network administrator can pull some strings and hack your phone.   </span></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Signs that your mobile might be hacked</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s highly important to know about the signs that tell you there’s a high chance your phone might be hacked. Let’s look at some most common ones &#8211;</span></p>\n<p><b>Strange or Unauthorized pop-ups:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One apparent sign of a hacked phone is non stop pop-ups. Bright, flashing ads or X-rated content popping up on the phone is a big indicator that your phone is probably compromised. </span></p>\n<p><b>Sudden increment of battery drainage:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your phone’s battery is draining faster than normal without any specific reason, it could be a sign that your phone has been hacked. Usually phone battery life depends on the screen on time and apps running in the background. If you do not drastically change the time you look at the phone everyday there’s no reason the screen on time should take up a chunk of the bratty life. Usually a hacked phone runs several background process which results in big battery drain</span></p>\n<p><b>Data usage rate going up without particular reason</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one is also similar to the previous cause. There are many reasons for high data usage (for example, increased use of a new app). But if your phone behavior has stayed the same and your data usage has skyrocketed, it’s time to investigate. Mostly because background apps are probably taking up a big chunk of the data which you never have authorized.</span></p>\n<p><b>Phone Temperature rises rapidly</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also a related phenomenon. The reason behind a phone becoming hot while using is mostly apps running in the background with high processing needs. It could be possible that your Internet connection and data are being used more rapidly than usual which contributes to higher temperature.</span></p>\n<p><b>Unauthorized Texts or calls</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every phone user is likely to remember the usage of their phone throughout the day. So, if you notice texts or calls from your phone that you didn’t make, you may have had your phone hacked.</span></p>\n<p><b>No messages or calls</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other could also be true. If you are no longer receiving calls or messages, the hacker might have obtained a clone of your SIM card from the service provider and your original sim might have become obsolete.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How to get rid of the malware from smartphone</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it’s confirmed that your phone is under attack then it’s wise to take steps to remove the malware from the device. There are a few ways to do so, let’s take a look at them. </span></p>\n<p><b>Deleting app / apps responsible for the malware</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suspicious apps are the most common source of inviting malware in your smartphone. In the case of your phone being hacked, take an inventory of your apps and delete anything that came from non-authorized third-party sources. All the apps should be available in the authorized store (Google play store or Apple App store), come from reputable developers and contain good reviews. Anything else should not stay on your phone and should be deleted=</span></p>\n<p><b>Running anti-malware software</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-malware software can help you identify and target malware lurking on your phone. This should be run regularly, but if you haven’t done so recently, now is always a good time to start. Modern cybersecurity software like REVE Antivirus Mobile Security helps protect your devices and online privacy. Use this to get rid of the malware from your device.</span></p>\n<p><b>Resetting the device</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resetting the phone will remove most of the malwares, however this should be considered as the last resort. Because, a factory reset will wipe out any data stored in the device, including images, videos, contacts or any documents that are saved in the phone&#8217;s built-in memory. That’s why it’s absolutely necessary to back-up any data that is important to you and you need once the phone is in its optimum state. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Some frequently asked questions on Phone Hack</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8869 size-full\" src=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vecteezy_confused-man-with-question-mark-concept-flat-illustration_.jpg\" alt=\"FAQ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This almost sums up the scenario of malwares on smartphones. However, there are some frequently asked questions. Let’s wrap up the discussion by answering those</span></p>\n<p><b>What is the most common way of hacking a phone?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers use a variety of methods to compromise cell phones including, Phishing attacks, <a href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/what-is-smishing\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Smishing attacks</a>, Spyware, Scareware, Vulnerable Wi-Fi network, Malicious apps etc.</span></p>\n<p><b>Can I reset my phone to remove viruses?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, a factory reset is one way to potentially remove a virus from an infected mobile device. However you should back-up your data before doing so as resetting a device wipes out all data.</span></p>\n<p><b>Does turning off your phone stop hackers?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, turning off your phone can stop hackers, as most cyberattacks targeting cell phones require the device to be turned on. However, if the malware is installed on your device, as soon as you turn it on, the malicious app will start doing its job.</span></p>\n<p><b>Can hackers hear you?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Affirmative, hackers generally try to gain access to your phone’s camera and microphone. If they are successful, there is nothing between them and hearing everything you say and record.</span></p>\n<p><b>Can someone hack your phone and turn on your camera? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, cybercriminals can hack phones to gain access to their cameras.</span></p>\n<p><b>Does airplane mode block hackers?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can temporarily block hackers while the device is not connected to Wi-Fi or a cellular  network.</span></p>\n<p><b>What can a hacker do with your phone number? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers often compromise phone numbers in order to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify 2FA requests </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send malicious links </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete vishing attacks</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reveantivirus.com/blog/en/can-a-smartphone-be-hacked\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Can A Smartphone be Hacked?
