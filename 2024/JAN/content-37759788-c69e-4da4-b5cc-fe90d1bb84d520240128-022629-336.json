Their version includes detailed footnotes</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GUEST ANALYSIS</strong> &nbsp;&#8212; Allowing Russia to win&nbsp;its war in Ukraine would be a self-imposed strategic defeat for the United States.&nbsp;The United States would face the risk of a larger and costlier war in Europe. The United States would face the worst threat from Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as a victorious Russia would likely emerge reconstituted and more determined to undermine the United States — and confident that it can. A Russian victory would diminish America’s deterrence around the world, emboldening others with an explicit or latent intent to harm the United States. A Russian victory&nbsp;would create an ugly world in which the atrocities associated with Russia’s way of war and way of ruling the populations under its control are normalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most dangerous of all, however, US adversaries would learn that they can break America’s will to act in support of their strategic interests.&nbsp;The ground truths of this war have not changed: Russia still explicitly intends to erase Ukraine as a concept, people, and state; Ukraine’s will to fight remains strong; Russia has made no operationally significant advances this year; and Ukraine’s will combined with the West’s collective capability (which dwarfs Russia’s) can defeat Russia on the battlefield.&nbsp;US interests still include preventing future Russian attacks on Ukraine and helping Ukraine liberate its people and territory. Supporting Ukraine is still the best path for the United States to avoid higher costs, larger escalation risks, and a greater Russian threat. What’s changing is Americans’ perceptions of their interests, not the interests themselves. That American perceptions are changing is not an accident. It is, in fact, precisely the effect the Kremlin has been seeking to achieve. The Kremlin’s principal effort is destroying America’s will by altering Americans’ understanding of their interests, and this effort appears to be working.&nbsp;If Russia wins in Ukraine because of the collapse of Western aid, it will be because Russia has managed to shape&nbsp;Americans’ understanding of reality such that the United States willingly chooses to act against its interests and values without realizing that it is doing so.&nbsp;Russia will have manipulated America into abandoning its own interests in a fight it could and should have won.&nbsp;That’s a dangerous lesson for China, Iran, and other US adversaries to learn. America’s security now and in the future, in Asia and the Middle East as well as in Europe, depends on remaining solidly connected with our strategic interests and values and demonstrating that we will not fall prey to efforts to manipulate our perceptions of those interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ASSESSED RISKS OF FAILURE IN UKRAINE FOR THE UNITED STATES</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another war under worse conditions</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A self-imposed defeat in Ukraine will confront the United States with the real risk of another war in Europe with higher escalation risks and higher costs. Cutting aid to Ukraine will not freeze the frontlines, as ISW has assessed. It will instead diminish Ukraine’s ability to hold off the Russian military and accelerate Russia’s military drive further and further west because the fundamental driver of this war — the Kremlin’s intent to eradicate Ukraine’s identity and statehood — has not changed. Putin regularly restates this intent, most recently on December 19. If Russia defeats Ukraine’s conventional military, Ukrainians will likely turn to an insurgency, as their will to defend against the existential threat remains strong. Such an insurgency will likely last years if not decades and is unlikely to be contained within Ukraine’s borders. The United States and NATO will likely face a Russian military deployed along the NATO border from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean and face enormous costs and risks in deterring further Russian aggression against NATO itself, as ISW has assessed. In an alternative scenario in which Russia gets a reprieve via a premature ceasefire or insufficient Western aid that halts Ukraine’s advance, but without allowing Russia to complete its conquest, Russia will rebuild and launch new attacks on Ukraine. The United States would face the high likelihood of another Russian invasion of Ukraine to complete the conquest at a higher cost of Ukrainian lives and US taxpayer dollars, the same or worse escalation risks, and under conditions that favor Russia, including degraded global support for Ukraine, degraded cohesion within Ukraine, a strengthened Putin regime, a stronger Russian military and narratives, more advantageous starting lines for Russia compared to February 2022, and higher Russian immunity to coercive measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Listen to Cipher Brief CEO &amp; Publisher Suzanne Kelly’s conversation with Nataliya Bugayova on ‘The Fight’ Podcast focused on Life and War in Ukraine, available wherever you listen to podcasts</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States risks needlessly choosing a path antithetical to its interests and values when it can still help Ukraine succeed. The military challenge facing Ukraine&nbsp;is great but not insurmountable.&nbsp;The&nbsp;West already has in its arsenals the capabilities necessary to address nearly all challenges confronting Ukraine on the battlefield, as ISW assessed.&nbsp;Russia, on the other hand, has not yet gotten onto the right side of the capability curve.&nbsp;The Kremlin has been investing in regaining its offensive capability in Ukraine and with time Russia may be able to do so, but it has not been able to do so yet. The window to expel Russia from Ukraine remains open. The West has the tools to deny Russia the reprieve on the battlefield and access to global resources Russia needs to reconstitute and end the war on the West’s terms and in the West’s interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Greater Russian threat to the United States</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Russian victory in Ukraine would present the West with a reconstituted and emboldened Russia that is more determined to undermine the United States. There is no going back to the pre-2022 status quo. The United States is on track to be blindsided by Russia’s transformation — again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has permanently changed Russia. It has cemented an ultra-nationalist ideology that believes in expansion by force and that is inherently anti-Western.&nbsp;A Russian victory in Ukraine is a certain path to another Putin or worse.&nbsp;Putin has been consolidating Russia’s elites and society around his pro-war agenda through a ‘get out or get in line’ approach.&nbsp;His invasion necessarily relies on Russians who support the war, are willing to rally support, or are simply willing to get in line. This reliance has illuminated and nurtured the full range of Russian nationalists — from the ultra-nationalists&nbsp;willing or seemingly willing to pursue Putin’s expansionist goals in Ukraine regardless of the cost to those largely subscribed to Putin’s goals but diverging on ways to achieve them.&nbsp;Putin has chosen not to silence and, in some cases, has empowered the Russian milblogger community and the nationalist constituency they represent, as they have shown themselves to be effective at rallying Russians in support of the war.&nbsp;Russian nationalists in power and society are intent on restoring Russia’s greatness and undermining the United States.&nbsp;They are inherently anti-Western. They are also, ironically and depressingly, the closest thing to civil society Russia currently has. If Russia loses in Ukraine, their future is uncertain. Their power will most certainly grow if Russia keeps its gains in Ukraine, however, as Putin will have demonstrated by success that Russia can afford to pay horrific costs and still win because the West will eventually back down. He and his successors will seek to apply that lesson to a larger game — the destruction of NATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next Russian leader after Putin may or may not be like or worse than Putin if Russia loses in Ukraine. A&nbsp;Russian victory in Ukraine is a nearly guaranteed path to another Putin or worse,&nbsp;however, because of the political imperatives that an empowered nationalist community would create.&nbsp;Putin recently revived his expansionist narratives that deny Ukrainian territorial integrity as part of his presidential campaign, likely to appeal to these communities.&nbsp;The nationalists will carry Putin&#8217;s intent forward (the same intent toward Ukraine, the United States, and NATO that led to the full-scale invasion) and may even generate and pursue a more extreme version of this intent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin is rallying Russians for a long-term fight with the West. The anti-Western narrative will become the foundation of the Kremlin’s next national myth if Russia wins. The narrative of confrontation with the West has increasingly defined Putin’s rule. Missing Putin’s accumulating grudge is exactly why the West has been strategically surprised by Putin in the past. The 2022 invasion has taken anti-American narratives in Russia to new heights. Confrontation with the West has become the Kremlin’s central domestic justification of this war and a key justification for its own increasingly authoritarian rule — after the initial justifications about denazification, demilitarization, etc. became less resonant. Anti-Western rhetoric in Russia comes in many forms: from the Kremlin talking heads discussing a potential nuclear strike on the US; to Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev’s insinuations about a civil war in the US; to constant explicit and thinly veiled threats against NATO states, including Russian propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov’s statements that one “Sarmat” [nuclear] missile is enough to drown the United Kingdom; to falsely blaming the United States for the Kremlin’s failures, and even implying that the United States supports terrorism in Russia. It is easy to dismiss these statements as lunacy. But narratives rule Russia, they have got us where we are today with Russia, and they will shape Russia’s foreign policy for years to come. If Russia wins in Ukraine, these narratives will serve as the basis for the next Russian national myth.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing?

Russia has significantly depleted its military capability in Ukraine. But, unlike in 2022, the Kremlin today is acutely aware of its capability gap and seeks to close it. Russia is pursuing large-scale military reforms,&nbsp;revamping its defense industrial base (DIB), investing in technological adaptation, and reconfiguring its international web of capability partners.&nbsp;The Russian military uses Belarus’ trainers and training grounds to augment Russian force generation capabilities.&nbsp;The Kremlin has accelerated its militarization of Russian society by instituting mandatory patriotic and military education in Russian schools, among other measures, as it seeks to expand Russia’s future recruitment base via the indoctrination of its population.&nbsp;The Kremlin’s progress is constrained by its decision to employ half-measures for DIB revitalization, as well as the invasion cannibalizing Russia&#8217;s long-term military reforms.&nbsp;But the potential for Russia to rebuild its military should not be underestimated if the Kremlin gets a reprieve or a win in Ukraine and can focus on reconstitution with full force, new knowledge, stronger commitment, and a resilient web of military capability partners — like Iran and North Korea — that the Kremlin has codified throughout the invasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia would absorb — not just control — any areas of Ukraine and Belarus it seizes, expanding Russia’s military footprint and resource base. Russia has made alarming progress in normalizing a continuous military presence in Belarus, including securing unprecedented basing access and freedom of movement even beyond Belarusian military infrastructure. A Russian victory in Ukraine would free up the Kremlin’s capacity to finalize its control over Belarus. But in such a case the Kremlin will likely go beyond control and use Russia’s ‘digestion’ playbook (its brutal rapid version in Ukraine and a softer slower version in Belarus) to erase local identity in any areas of Ukraine and Belarus that Russia manages to control.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Subscriber+Members have a higher level of access to Cipher Brief Expert Perspectives and get exclusive access to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/dead-drop\">The Dead Drop</a>, the best national security gossip publication, if we do say so ourselves.  Find out what you’re missing. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Upgrade your access to Subscriber+ now</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin is likely to pursue an outright absorption of Belarus and areas of Ukraine it manages to seize for two reasons. First, Ukraine and Belarus&nbsp;are core to Putin’s vision of the Russian world and also to Putin’s accelerated effort to reverse the Slavic demographic decline to prevent a looming social cohesion crisis in Russia.&nbsp;(For similar reasons Putin has been obsessed with increasing the birth rate among Slavic Russians, russification of non-ethnic Russians, and deporting and reeducating Ukrainian children in Russia.)&nbsp;Second,&nbsp;unlike in the pre-2022 world, Putin may assess that the only way to solve the Ukraine and Belarus problem for good (that is, to eliminate the risk that they might drift away from Russia in the future) is to absorb any areas Russia manages to control. Any areas in Ukraine or Belarus that Russia gets would also become permanent de facto or de jure Russian military basing. (Russia occupies 17.8 percent of Ukraine today, compared to 7.1 percent in 2021, and stands in this scenario — at a minimum — to absorb this territory to transform it into a lodgment from which to launch future offensives. The end of Western military aid would allow Russia to expand the area it controls dramatically.) Expanded Russian basing along NATO’s border will impose major risks, costs, and obligations on the alliance to defend against this expanded Russian posture. Absorbing parts of Ukraine and Belarus would significantly increase Russia’s power, adding millions of people, including the skilled labor and industrial assets that remain and the territory not scorched, for the Kremlin to use for the reconstitution of the Russian military.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Russian victory in Ukraine would increase the likelihood of military action against other Russian neighbors.&nbsp;The Kremlin still intends to re-establish control over its other neighbors.&nbsp;Only now the Kremlin may&nbsp;have to&nbsp;rely on force to regain influence, as several former Soviet countries have tried to diversify away from Russia while the Kremlin has been preoccupied with Ukraine.&nbsp;The Kremlin is acutely aware of this drift, with Kremlin outlets suggesting that Russia should invade Kazakhstan,&nbsp;Medvedev threatening Georgia with Russia’s capability to annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia,&nbsp;and Kremlin proxies trying to destabilize Moldova.&nbsp;In a world in which Russia keeps its gains in Ukraine,&nbsp;little will stop Putin from integrating other territories it chooses to perceive as its sphere of influence by force via its hybrid schemas (e.g., breakaway republics) or an outright absorption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin would resume its presently constrained effort to expand its global military footprint and broader influence.&nbsp;The Kremlin still intends to expand its foothold in the Arctic and establish control over the Northern Sea Route, pursue broader influence and military basing in Africa, and it has maintained its campaign in the Balkans.&nbsp;The Kremlin will pursue these and other efforts with new energy, legitimacy and resources if it solidifies its gains in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin would get closer to a real opportunity to break NATO.&nbsp;Putin sought to use its invasion of Ukraine to break NATO — an objective he failed at but continues to pursue.&nbsp;A key Russian threat to NATO is the risk of the Kremlin manipulating NATO into disavowing its principles.&nbsp;NATO will be discredited if Russia keeps its gains in Ukraine and its defense guarantees will be undermined. NATO’s Article 5 — the commitment to mutual self-defense — is not a magic shield. It draws its legitimacy in part from the United States’&nbsp;persistent decision to commit to its partners. American leaders must remember, as the Russians surely do, that any NATO state under attack can invoke Article 5, which states that in the case of an armed attack on a member state, each other member state shall take “forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary&#8230;.” Article 5 does not automatically and legally commit every member of NATO to use military force to defend a member under attack. Each NATO state will have to decide how to act. The question of the resolve of all NATO member states to go to war in defense of a member under attack is thus paramount in the efficacy of Article 5 in deterring aggression. That efficacy, therefore, is not at all independent of the demonstrated willingness of the United States and other NATO states to stand by commitments to non-NATO states. If the United States&nbsp;abandons Ukraine, as it abandoned its partners in Afghanistan, the certainty that the United States would fight Russia in defense of, say, one of the Baltic States, will be harmed.&nbsp;There is every reason to think that the United States will, in fact, honor its Article 5 obligations — but also every reason to fear that Putin and his successors will assess that it will not, in this scenario. Deterrence would be weakened, and the risk of a NATO–Russia war would increase. Putin will go after NATO’s cohesion with new force, as in this scenario Russia will have an expanded military footprint on NATO’s border and an increased ability to target societal and political cohesion within the alliance. Russia will also accelerate its information operations trying to convince Americans that the United States simply does not need NATO — a campaign that is more likely to succeed in a scenario where the Kremlin already managed to convince the United States&nbsp;to decrease or cease its support to Ukraine.&nbsp;The future of NATO is bound up with the future of Ukraine much more tightly than most people understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Degrading America’s will</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia targets what it perceives to be the US center of gravity — America’s will to act. The Kremlin is using its information-based warfare together with military operations to persuade the United States to choose inaction in Ukraine. If Russia succeeds, it will not only result in catastrophic consequences for Ukraine, but also establish that the Kremlin’s reflexive control&nbsp;is an effective asymmetric warfare capability against the United States — for other US adversaries to use if they can master it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin seeks to strip America of its will to act. This is one of the very few ways, and certainly the fastest, for Russia to gain the advantage in Ukraine and restore its power globally.&nbsp;The Kremlin perceives the United States to be the only sovereign state that stands — in terms of will and capability — between Russia and the Kremlin’s ‘rightful’ place in Ukraine and globally. Moscow sees the United States as an enemy. The Kremlin thus seeks not just to compete with the United States but to diminish US power and global influence. The&nbsp;US Department of Defense (DoD) defines a center of gravity&nbsp;as a source of power that provides moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act. The Kremlin has limits on its ability to compete with or meaningfully degrade US physical strength.&nbsp;The Kremlin has been, therefore, focused on diminishing America’s will to act, which it likely sees as America’s center of gravity.&nbsp;Russia seeks to shape America’s behavior to act against its interests and values, to strip the United States of the will to act altogether, and to convince the world that the United States can and should be dismissed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin is engaged in several lines of effort in support of this objective:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Russia seeks to undermine Americans’ belief in the value of action as such. Putin needs the United States to choose inaction in Ukraine, otherwise, Russia cannot win. This model has worked for Putin domestically, where the Kremlin has established inaction as a default response by Russian citizens to external and internal stimuli. Putin convinced Russians that an alternative to him is either worse or too costly to fight for. The Kremlin seeks to convince the United States that Ukraine’s victory is unattainable, too costly or not in America’s interest.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Russia seeks to undermine the perception of US credibility, power, leverage, and righteousness around the world to diminish America’s ability to inspire others to act. Even when preoccupied in Ukraine, Russia is investing in anti-US narratives, often supported by physical means, from Africa to South America. The Kremlin is also targeting US allies and partners — a core pillar of US power — while simultaneously investing in an anti-US coalition in support of the same effort.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Kremlin is targeting global will to act. Putin is working to create an international order that would simply accept, and never fight, Russian principles — such as the Kremlin’s claimed right to own Ukraine and commit atrocities inside of Russia and globally at will.  Russian officials frame this effort as Russia’s goal to “architect a fair global future.”<br></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If Russia wins in Ukraine, US adversaries will learn that the United States can be manipulated into abandoning its interests in a winnable fight.&nbsp;Russia cannot achieve its objectives in Ukraine if Ukraine’s will to fight persists along with adequate Western support. The Kremlin&nbsp;has long understood that one of the very few ways to reconcile its goals and means in Ukraine is to slow Western support to buy Russia time to regain the battlefield initiative and rebuild capability (which is what happened in winter 2022–2023)&nbsp;or, ideally, convince the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;to stop supporting Ukraine altogether. The Kremlin has invested heavily in this effort. A recent display of confidence by Russian propagandists and Putin&nbsp;amid hesitations in Western discourse likely indicates the Kremlin’s perception that the&nbsp;United States is starting to&nbsp;act in Russia’s interest.&nbsp;If the West cuts its support for Ukraine,&nbsp;it will likely be because the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;let Russia shape its behavior — as the fundamentals of this war, such as US interests, capabilities, and Ukraine’s will to fight, have not changed.&nbsp;The global anti-Western coalition will learn that it can asymmetrically defeat the West through manipulation and by outlasting it.&nbsp;Learning how to diminish US decision superiority is a dangerous lesson for US adversaries, especially China, to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scenario would necessarily mean that one of the few Russian capabilities that poses a real threat to the United States — information-based warfare — has received a major boost. Russian information-based warfare and reflexive control specifically have been among the stronger Russian capabilities and a core element of Russia’s strategy against the United States for years. Reflexive control is how Russia fights, and it is one of the true ways in which Russia poses a threat to America beyond its nuclear arsenal. Russia’s true sphere is its global information space — communities penetrated by the Russian narratives, including in the United States. If Russia wins in Ukraine, it will likely mean that Russia has managed to change America’s perception of itself, its interests, and the risks and costs it is willing to incur — and for what purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>What national security news are you missing today?  Get full access to your own national security daily brief by upgrading to<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\"> Subscriber+Member</a> status</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Altering America’s will is no small thing. America is an idea. America is a choice. America is a belief in the value of action. US domestic resilience and global power come in no small part from people and countries choosing the United States and from Americans preserving their agency to act with intent. An adversary learning how to alter these realities is an existential threat — especially when ideas are that adversary’s core weapon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A geostrategic environment that favors US adversaries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing Russia to win in Ukraine would result in a reshaped global order that favors US adversaries and normalizes the following ideas:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia (and other states strong enough) deserves its perceived sphere of influence, regardless of its neighbors’ will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Predators can redraw borders by force and victims must justify their right to exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western international institutions fail to fulfill&nbsp;the very missions they were built for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia can treat people in areas it controls any way it wants, including subjecting them to perpetual atrocities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States will face an international environment in which moral relativism further resurges and values further erode, fueled by arguments to the effect&nbsp;of&nbsp;if Russia won, maybe they were not that bad, maybe it wasn’t a black and white issue after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These principles are antithetical to the rules-based international order, which remains a pillar of US prosperity and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An ugly world</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia winning in Ukraine would result in a world accepting of the&nbsp;Russian way of war and of life.&nbsp;Billions of people are watching this war. They will not remember the nuances. They will remember the results, including the principles that humanity collectively confronted or tolerated. If Russia wins, many horrific practices that the Kremlin is trying to justify will be normalized. To name a few:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atrocities as a way of war that are not only not condemned but are often lauded by the Russian media, such as Russia’s deliberate attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brutality as a way of life — both as a means to control civilian populations and to discipline warfighters,&nbsp;like the horrific practice of late PMC Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin having his own men executed with sledgehammers and ‘Prigozhin’s sledgehammer’ then becoming a lauded symbol within the Russian nationalist community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A playbook for ‘disappearing’ or ‘digesting’ a nation through an identity and statehood eradication campaign that Russia is undertaking across occupied Ukraine, including forceful deportation of children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Russia wins, it will refocus its information efforts on rewriting history and launching narratives for why the abovementioned actions were justified through its information sphere of influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RISKS OF ESCALATION</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of failure for the United States in Ukraine is higher than the risks implicit in helping Ukraine win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will always be a risk of escalation, including when Putin invades Ukraine again if Russia is allowed to freeze the lines.&nbsp;In this scenario, however, the United States would likely face an even larger escalation risk because Russia will be closer to a direct confrontation with NATO.&nbsp;Basing US policy on the assumption that the United States can never run the risk of a nuclear escalation means the United States has subordinated its national security to any nuclear power. Unless the United States chooses to do so, accepting the risk now to decrease the chances of a larger risk of escalation in the future remains a prudent course of action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The West needs to recalibrate its perception of escalation based on the experience of the past two years.&nbsp;The Kremlin has shifted its multiple stated ‘red lines’ and has not changed its response even to direct attacks on its prized Black Sea Fleet, as well as drone strikes and operations deep into Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin remains a rational actor and often a risk-averse one.&nbsp;He invaded Ukraine at a moment when he expected minimal resistance from Ukraine and the West as evidenced by his assessment that Russia could conquer Ukraine in a matter of days.&nbsp; He also invaded only after he had ensured that his domestic grip on power was solid.&nbsp;Both facts are indicative of a risk-aware actor.&nbsp;Putin&nbsp;also&nbsp;has been cautious about testing the limits of the Kremlin’s information control — as the stability of his regime in part depends on it. Putin still refuses to call Russia’s war a war and is not precisely defining his vision for the end of the war. The “special military operation” framing likely reaches the limit of what Putin assesses he can demand of the Russian people, as he&nbsp;tries to conceal the sacrifices that Russian people will need to make to support this war — i.e., mobilization.&nbsp;His assessment of his regime’s stability has self-confined him to suboptimal ways of fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk of nuclear war is inherent in any attempt to resist the aggression of any nuclear-armed state.&nbsp;It will be manifest if Russia attacks Ukraine again or if it threatens or attacks NATO. It will be present if China attacks Taiwan. An American policy that refuses to accept any risk of nuclear use anywhere is a policy of permanent and limitless surrender to nuclear-armed predators. Such a policy will encourage their predation and it will also encourage other predators such as Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Russian victory in Ukraine would create a world fundamentally antithetical to US interests&nbsp;and values with an empowered anti-Western coalition.&nbsp;US deterrence power and geopolitical standing will diminish. The cost of&nbsp;protecting the homeland and operating globally will rise, as will the number of national security issues the United States will have to tackle. More states and groups will challenge America at home and abroad. Latent adversarial intent is more likely to transform into action — which is how we got here in the first place, when Russia perceived the West to be weak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The asymmetry goes both ways: Ukraine is the lynchpin on which the future of Russia’s power hinges.&nbsp;Russia’s ability to reconstitute; to maintain and increase its control and influence over its neighbors; the power of the Kremlin’s global narratives and ability to manipulate US will and perceptions; and the strength of Russia’s coalitions, including with US adversaries, all depend on whether Russia wins or loses in Ukraine. Helping Ukraine win would not only prevent Russia from erasing an independent nation and save the Ukrainian people from Russian atrocities and murder but would also land an asymmetric blow to the Russian threat and the anti-US coalition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as Ukraine remains committed to defending itself against Russia’s aggression, the best course of action for the United States is to commit to the path of helping Ukraine win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone’s Business.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-high-price-of-losing-ukraine\">The High Price of Losing Ukraine</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-high-price-of-losing-ukraine/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Enabled by Iran: Houthis Push Forward with Attacks in the Red Sea","link":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/enabled-by-iran-houthis-push-forward-with-attacks-in-the-red-sea","comments":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/enabled-by-iran-houthis-push-forward-with-attacks-in-the-red-sea#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Suzanne Kelly"},"pubDate":"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 14:59:17 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Houthis"},{"#cdata-section":"Iran"},{"#cdata-section":"Red Sea"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/?p=45452"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>SUBSCRIBER+EXCLUSIVE REPORTING – Despite warnings from multiple countries, the Iranian-backed, Yemen-based Houthi militia are continuing attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, adding a new <span class=\"more\">[...]</span> <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/enabled-by-iran-houthis-push-forward-with-attacks-in-the-red-sea\" class=\"post_link inline\">More <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-right\"></i></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/enabled-by-iran-houthis-push-forward-with-attacks-in-the-red-sea\">Enabled by Iran: Houthis Push Forward with Attacks in the Red Sea</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div class='memberful-global-teaser-content'>\n<p><strong>SUBSCRIBER+EXCLUSIVE REPORTING</strong> – Despite <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/01/04/background-press-call-on-recent-attacks-by-the-houthis/\">warnings</a> from multiple countries, the Iranian-backed, Yemen-based Houthi militia are continuing attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, adding a new complexity to tensions in the region and adding significant cost to the commercial shipping industry. </p>\n<p>“The actions that we’ve seen from these Houthi forces are destabilizing,” Pentagon spokesman Brig.

Looking back at the arguments months later, I was right on three points but wrong on one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States and Europe have indeed begun to lose patience with a war that is costing billions and is interfering with domestic elections. The chances of a successful counter-offensive were overrated, and Ukraine did indeed fail to win back substantial amounts of territory. And thirdly, I stressed that a negotiated deal would be disastrous for Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I was wrong was in thinking that a negotiated deal (however disadvantageous) would be available for Ukraine when it finally decided that it could no longer win. In fact, President Putin gave the strong impression in his press conference on 15<sup>th</sup> December that he wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/vladimir-putin-peace-russia-ukraine-president\">carry on</a> and achieve his original goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having weathered a torrid year, which included the <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-wagner-groups-march-to-infamy\">Wagner mutiny</a> and being forced to relocate the Black Sea Fleet from Crimea, Putin now sees an opportunity to make real territorial gains. He also knows that the West’s capacity and willingness to sustain a long campaign is limited. Furthermore, the diversion of Western political attention (and some American military hardware) towards Israel and Gaza was an unexpected windfall for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine is not ready for talks either. The summer of 2023 was not as disastrous as Western pundits are claiming. Fortunately, Kyiv discovered very early that the Leopard tanks were not ‘game changers’ and by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-awards-medals-after-claiming-hits-leopard-tanks-us-bradleys-ukraine-2023-06-11/\">losing several Leopards</a> in one day in mid-June, Ukraine did not expend too many precious lives on repeated attempts to break through Russia’s layered defences in a utopian thrust to the Sea of Azov. Instead, they launched a successful missile campaign against the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and a number of drone and missile attacks against Russian air force bases, destroying transport aircraft and long-range bombers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> However, as President Zelensky’s Commander-in-Chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/05/zelenskiy-denies-ukrainian-generals-claim-war-is-at-stalemate\">correctly observed</a> there is now a deadlock along the whole eastern front.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing?

For Ukraine, the war will return to being primarily defensive. This is a good thing. It is much easier to defend than to attack, and Russia will lose thousands of troops in trying to gain ground. But it is a 600km defensive line and Ukraine needs to install similar obstacles to those used so successfully by the Russians last winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, United States support will become increasingly problematic. It is possible, even likely, that President Biden will finally unblock a $60 billion package of <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/06/politics/biden-ukraine-aid/index.html\">military assistance</a> but that may well be the final one of that size, even if Biden were to win the Presidential election in November. If Trump were to win, there may be no further aid to Ukraine at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This poses some major questions for Europe. So far, Europe has treated this war as a discretionary conflict rather than an existential one. The genuine prospect of a Russian dominated bloc which could threaten Poland, Georgia, Moldova and above all, the Baltic States, should be enough to shake Europe out of its complacency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Europe needs to work out whether it could continue to support Ukraine militarily if U.S. assistance were to end. If so, it needs to start three-shift working in its ammunition factories, starting soon. For example, Thales in Belfast, which manufactures the highly successful Swedish NLAW anti-tank missile, should be working a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 155mm artillery shells need to be churned out in bulk across all of Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level of effort would require emergency budgets and would inevitably impact domestic spending on hitherto untouchable social programmes. Europe needs to work out now whether it can replicate the U.S. logistics chain which has been so effective in getting munitions to eastern Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members enjoy unlimited access to Cipher Brief content, including analysis with experts, private virtual briefings with experts, the M-F Open-Source Report and the weekly Dead Drop &#8211; an insider look at the latest gossip in the national security space.  It pays to be a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Subscriber+Member</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Europe needs to get serious about three issues which have been discussed ad infinitum. Is it going to seize the £300 billion of Russian assets in the West or not? Is it going to close the gaping loopholes on purchasing Russian energy products on the secondary market? And is it not time to suspend all Russian visas to Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirdly, Ukraine’s EU membership needs to be fast-tracked. Even after the welcome recent news about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67722252\">accession talks</a>, French President Emmanuel Macron spoiled the effect by suggesting it would <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61383632\">take a decade.</a> Clearly, Ukraine cannot join NATO while the fighting is still ongoing but the promise must be there of membership immediately after the war is over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both these issues raise the question of what to do about the blockers. The objections of Prime Minister Orban of Hungary to EU membership and President Erdogan of Turkey to NATO accession need to be addressed soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 must be the year when the Ukraine war stops being viewed in Europe as a nearer version of Iraq and Afghanistan where we can get bored and walk away. Ukraine can almost certainly survive throughout 2024, but 2025 will be another matter. &nbsp;If Trump were to make a deal with Putin similar to the deal he made with the Taliban, is Europe ready to continue supporting Ukraine?&nbsp; At present, that is unthinkable given the state of Europe’s military spending and capabilities. However, the alternative is to have Russia on Europe’s doorstep with the proverbial “snow on their boots”, just one incident away from a major war in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article by Cipher Brief Expert Tim Willasey-Wilsey was first published in <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/ukraine-war-why-2024-is-going-to-be-a-year-of-reckoning-for-ukraine-and-europe-tim-willasey-wilsey-4452592\">The Scotsman</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">The Cipher Brief</a> because National Security is Everyone’s Business.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?  Send it to <a href=\"mailto:Editor@thecipherbrief.com\">Editor@thecipherbrief.com</a> for publication consideration.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-2024-europes-year-of-reckoning\">Ukraine 2024:  Europe&#8217;s Year of Reckoning</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-2024-europes-year-of-reckoning/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Expert Opinion: Bringing Down Putin’s House of Cards","link":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/expert-opinion-bringing-down-putins-house-of-cards","comments":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/expert-opinion-bringing-down-putins-house-of-cards#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Suzanne Kelly"},"pubDate":"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 17:00:19 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Russia"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/?p=45389"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION (Part two of two) – Russian President Vladimir Putin and the kleptocratic regime he has created are the problem.  The Putin <span class=\"more\">[...]</span> <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/expert-opinion-bringing-down-putins-house-of-cards\" class=\"post_link inline\">More <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-right\"></i></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/expert-opinion-bringing-down-putins-house-of-cards\">Expert Opinion: Bringing Down Putin&#8217;s House of Cards</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div class='memberful-global-teaser-content'>\n<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE / OPINION</strong> (<em>Part two of two</em>) – Russian President Vladimir Putin and the kleptocratic regime he has created are the problem.  The Putin regime is arguably the source of most of the disharmony and disruption visible in the world today.  No reasonable person can dispute this. </p>\n<p>An stark example is Putin’s willingness to use Russia’s military in naked aggression against neighbors by starting a war in Europe, the scale of which has not been seen since 1945.&nbsp;

The intervention of his military and mercenaries abroad to support corrupt and authoritarian regimes is without modern precedent.&nbsp; He has supplied weapons that have been used to shoot down civilian aircraft.&nbsp;

Our list also might be useful if you&#8217;re looking to drop some hints to Santa for stuff you’d like to find in your own stocking this year.<br><br><strong>WHERE TO BEGIN?</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The obvious place to start is in the book review section of <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/book-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Cipher Brief</a>. During 2023, <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/book-review\">we published reviews of 45 books</a>. That number of books is too unwieldy for this list, so we thought we’d pare it down and focus on those which earned the highest honors of 3.5 or 4 Trench Coats&nbsp;(The Cipher Brief’s rating system for singling out excellence.) But even that didn’t put much of a dent in the workload – since 27 of our 45 books scored those highest ratings.<br><br><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> the Trench Coat ratings are solely determined by our volunteer reviewers – so your mileage may vary. You may love a book that only snared two Trench Coats from our reviewer – or hate one that earned four.&nbsp; But Cipher Brief reviewers bring a wealth of experience and an eagle eye to the process, so we suspect you are likely to agree.<br><br>While we don’t have the bandwidth to summarize even 27 books, here are some standouts that our reviewers loved the most. The majority of the books we reviewed were non-fiction – so let’s turn that on its head and start with some stellar novels.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>OUR FAVORITE FICTION BOOKS</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cipher Brief expert and veteran CIA Russia hand </em><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/paul-kolbe\">Paul Kolbe</a></em></strong><em> really liked the latest novel from former CIA analyst </em><strong><em>David McCloskey</em></strong><em> called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZItPsA\">Moscow X.</a>&nbsp;In Paul’s review <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/book-review/moscow-x-hits-the-mark\">he wrote</a> that he was “intrigued by and ultimately immersed, in a terrific plot seasoned with classic tradecraft, new methodologies and compelling characters.”&nbsp;If you are intrigued by McCloskey – <a href=\"http://sites.libsyn.com/453408/moscow-x\">check out the interview</a> he did with us for our Cover Stories podcast.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We turned to Rob Richer, a former high-ranking CIA clandestine service officer (and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/robert-richer\">Cipher Brief expert</a>) with tons of experience in the Middle East to review <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qAfeCd\">The Peacock and the Sparrow</a>&nbsp;a novel written by another former CIA officer, I.S. Berry.&nbsp; Richer praised&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/reviewing-the-peacock-and-the-sparrow\">Berry’s ability</a> to capture the “political complexity and internal sensitivities” of Bahrain and prose so sharp readers can “see the streets described in their mind’s eye, to sense the atmosphere, and (even) imagine the smells.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Cipher Brief has on call, Dr. Ken Dekleva, a former State Department Regional Medical Officer/Psychiatrist, to help us review several espionage novels. He <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/a-book-review-of-the-dead-drop-a-novel\">awarded</a> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Rm9k2t\">The Dead Drop</a>&nbsp;by James Roth, a solid 3.5 trench coats. That book is about a northern Virginia teenager who stumbles across a dead drop that leads to a complex tale of KGB vs CIA cold war espionage.</em><em><br><br>Earlier in the year, Dr. Dekleva reviewed: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Rm9k2t\">A True American Patriot: A Novel</a>&nbsp;by retired CIA officer Dan O’Connor. The novel has two protagonists – “Doc” – who <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/a-new-tale-of-action-and-geopolitical-intrigue\">Dekleva describes</a> as a mixture of “Secret Service agent and CIA paramilitary officer” and “the Professor” who is “gifted in math, physics, exotic foreign languages, and diplomacy.” Together they confront terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and more. By the way, we turn to Dr. Dekleva not just because of his ability to analyze the personalities of the characters in the books he reviews – but he is also a novelist on his own right having written <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/a-new-tale-of-action-and-geopolitical-intrigue\">The Negotiators Cross</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46bPECQ\">The Last Violinist.</a><br><br><strong>WHAT ABOUT NON-FICTION?</strong>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>There are so many good titles to choose from. Calder Walton, Assistant Director of the Harvard Center’s Applied History and Intelligence projects, was out with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JlTkJh\">Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West</a>&nbsp;this summer, so we turned to Daniel Hoffman, a former senior CIA officer, three-time station chief and <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/daniel-hoffman\">Cipher Brief expert</a> to break it down for us. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-epic-intelligence-war-between-east-and-west\">Dan found it to be</a> a “fascinating history of cloak and dagger espionage” which “lifts the veil on the multifarious clandestine operations Russia and the West conducted against one another for over a century.” If you want to know more about how that book came to be, Walder reveals some of the secrets of his scholarship in this&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sites.libsyn.com/453408/spies-and-other-secrets\">Cover Stories podcast</a>.</em><em><br><br>Then there was a book by Andrew Hoehn and Thom Shanker, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HUh0n1\">Age of Danger</a>, where they solve the simple problem mentioned in the subtitle of “Keeping America Safe in an Era of New Superpowers, New Weapons, and New Threats.” &nbsp;George Galdorisi, a former naval officer and bestselling <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LLzjvS\">author of fiction</a> and non-fiction in his own right, <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/living-in-an-age-of-danger\">reviewed the book for us</a> and called it a “clear-headed and well-reasoned argument that the U.S. policy, intelligence and military structures, many of which date back to the end of World War II, are no longer adequate to deal with today’s, and especially tomorrow’s, threats.” Just kidding about that “simple solution” part. But if you want to know more about <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HUh0n1\">Age of Danger</a>&nbsp;check out our interview with the authors for the <a href=\"http://sites.libsyn.com/453408/age-of-danger-keeping-america-safe-in-an-era-of-new-superpowers-new-weapons-and-new-threats\">Cover Stories podcast</a> back in May.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That leads us to the recently published: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FmwFdo\">Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine</a>&nbsp;written by retired 4-star general (<a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/gen-david-petraeus\">and Cipher Brief expert</a>) David Petraeus and British historian Lord Andrew Roberts.

Below is a letter sent to Congress this week, supported by 44 former members of government, about just how important it is for Congress not to let the authorities expire.]&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>December 11, 2023</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Honorable Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House of Representatives</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Honorable Steve Scalise, Majority Leader of the House of Representatives</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the House of Representatives</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Mr. Speaker and Members:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you well know, our nation is under significant threat today with wars in Europe and the Middle East, a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific, and the deadly flow of fentanyl across our southern border. &nbsp;In these circumstances, we cannot hamstring the U.S. Intelligence Community either by failing to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or by limiting it in ways that would make it difficult for the government to protect Americans. To be clear, Section 702 saves American lives and helps keep Americans safe from international terrorist attacks, foreign cyberattacks, overseas fentanyl suppliers, and other threats to our national security. There’s no substitute for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is in this context that we, a bipartisan group of former national security officials that served in Republican and Democratic Administrations and on Capitol Hill, write to urgently warn you of the devastating impacts to national security if Congress passes H.R. 6570, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, as reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We appreciate the serious efforts made by both that Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to evaluate <a>Section </a>702 and consider what privacy and additional protections are needed. In our view, however, the legislation reported out by the Committee on the Judiciary is seriously flawed and would hurt our government’s ability to protect Americans in the current heightened threat environment. We outline some of our concerns below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most notably, as written, H.R. 6570 could end the Section 702 program entirely. Section 21(d) of the bill enumerates the exclusive provisions of law allowing electronic surveillance, but – in what presumably is a serious drafting error – it fails to include Section 702. As a result, the bill could prohibit electronic surveillance through Section 702 using the compelled assistance of an electronic communications service provider. Ambiguous or erroneously drafted legislation must not imperil America’s safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>H.R. 6570 contains many other unworkable and dangerous provisions with no basis in the Constitution, statute, or caselaw. Below are just a few examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill grants unprecedented rights to foreigners. The proposed Section 702(f)(1) would extend to foreign spies and terrorists the same protections proposed to be afforded to Americans just because they might be (or have once been) in the United States. This goes against fundamental principles of decades of surveillance law carefully crafted by both Congress and the courts. Under the proposed provision, if a spy recruiter for the People’s Republic of China was known to be inside the United States, that person could not be the subject of a query under the proposed bill unless he (unlikely) qualified for one of the proposal’s limited exceptions. Moreover, by extending this “protection” to foreign targets communicating with one another, but not with any American at all, the bill would drastically limit the government’s ability to warn Americans that they are the targets of terrorist threats, malicious cyber activity, or espionage operations. Giving foreigners “query protection” does nothing to help Americans’ privacy but will instead endanger Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill would prohibit queries that have kept our nation safe.<a> The bill would bar the government from querying the Section 702 database with terms associated with Americans unless it first obtains a court warrant. Even when the government could establish probable cause – circumstances rarely immediately present in the fast-moving worlds of terrorists, spies, and ransomware gangs where the government often has merely a tip &#8212; it would still take days to do so. In short, if the Intelligence Community found out that a terrorist overseas was talking to someone inside the United States, it couldn’t search its database to determine whether there is an imminent threat to the United States. This will endanger American lives. Moreover, as written, this warrant requirement would apply not just to the FBI—which is the subject of other specific provisions based on prior controversies—but also to the entire intelligence community. This provision, if adopted, would greatly harm the foreign intelligence mission of the NSA, CIA and NCTC.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill would seriously undermine cybersecurity efforts. As written, the warrant “exception” for cybersecurity is dangerously narrow and will make it nearly impossible to protect Americans who are victims of foreign cyberattacks every day, let alone recover ransomware payments. Proposed Section 702(f)(2)(B)(i)(IV) purports to allow queries using a “known cybersecurity threat signature.” But it isn’t clear what a “known cybersecurity threat signature” even means. In any case, it apparently wouldn’t cover using actual names, IP addresses or email addresses of targets of malicious cyberattacks. Cybersecurity professionals know that those terms are precisely what’s needed to uncover the type and scope of a foreign cyberattack. The result of adopting this provision is that the government simply won’t be able to warn American citizens, businesses, hospitals, critical infrastructure owners, schools, and others of many imminent cyber threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As former national security officials, we believe the House cannot responsibly adopt H.R. 6750. By contrast, H.R. 6611, as reported by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, represents a thoughtful alternative approach to Section 702 reforms. Reasonable minds might disagree on the details of the various reforms that might be needed, even as included in the HPSCI bill. But it presents a rigorous approach to the challenges and attempts in a responsible way to balance privacy protections and our nation’s safety. Enacting H.R. 6750 will, by contrast, greatly hamstring our government’s efforts to protect Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Keith Alexander Former Director, National Security Agency &nbsp;</td><td>Chuck Alsup Former Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Stewart Baker Former Assistant Secretary for Policy, Department of Homeland Security George C.

Adding to its dominance, Israel has an estimated 170,000 active duty troops and a further 360,000 reservists on standby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF consistently <a href=\"https://www.globalfirepower.com/global-ranks-previous.php\">ranks</a> in the top twenty among the world’s most powerful militaries, as per the Global Firepower Index, a database that assesses factors such as troop numbers, weaponry, technology and financial resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Israeli arsenal includes advanced missile boats, tanks, attack helicopters and a large drone fleet.

In force-on-force direct combat, Israeli forces would quickly destroy an opposing Hamas force because of its superior firepower,” surmised Karl Kaltenthaler, Director of the Center for Intelligence and Security Studies and a Political Science Professor at the University of Akron. “But Hamas is not planning to fight that kind of war. This will be a war of guerilla tactics by Hamas and possibly a prolonged insurgency in Gaza. They do not need massive firepower to accomplish that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Kaltenthaler’s purview, the most critical factors in Hamas’s weapons cache buildup are the massive support they get from Iran and the smuggling of arms that Hamas procures from elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Without Iran’s help, Hamas would be a much weaker force than it is today,” he cautioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to defense technologist and co-author of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3R53fWm\">Hunting the Caliphate</a></em>, co-authored by Wes J. Bryant, Hamas primarily utilizes older Chinese and Russian-model assault rifles, machine guns, and grenades in addition to their own rocket manufacturing capabilities used specifically to bombard Israel’s storied Iron Dome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The majority of fighters carry some variant of AK-47. All these weapons are the same as the weapons U.S. forces are using in all of our counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, and the supply channels are much the same. Most often adversary state-sponsored, Iran in this case,” he continued. “As well, there is just such a proliferation of Soviet-era weapons across the Middle East that there are a multitude of ways in which Hamas and parallel forces end up being supplied.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">The Cipher Brief</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/a-look-inside-hamass-weapons-arsenal\">A Look Inside Hamas&#8217;s Weapons Arsenal</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/a-look-inside-hamass-weapons-arsenal/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Russia, Hamas and a Moment of Global Challenge","link":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-hamas-and-a-moment-of-global-challenge","comments":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-hamas-and-a-moment-of-global-challenge#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Suzanne Kelly"},"pubDate":"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 14:16:35 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Hamas"},{"#cdata-section":"Iran"},{"#cdata-section":"Israel"},{"#cdata-section":"Russia"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/?p=45185"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>SUBSCRIBER+EXCLUSIVE – Hamas thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his support as it released 25-year-old Russian-Israeli dual national Ron Krivoi from captivity on Sunday in <span class=\"more\">[...]</span> <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-hamas-and-a-moment-of-global-challenge\" class=\"post_link inline\">More <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-right\"></i></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-hamas-and-a-moment-of-global-challenge\">Russia, Hamas and a Moment of Global Challenge</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div class='memberful-global-teaser-content'>\n<p><strong>SUBSCRIBER+EXCLUSIVE </strong>– Hamas thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his support as it released 25-year-old Russian-Israeli dual national Ron Krivoi from captivity on Sunday in a sign of the growing closeness in the relationship between Moscow and Hamas.

We may need to escalate to de-escalate before U.S. forces are killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The credibility of both Israeli and U.S. intelligence is on the line, regarding what ultimately is found at al-Shifa hospital.  The IDF video showing weapons recovered at al-Shifa is certainly significant, as this does demonstrate the Hamas utilization of the hospital, which is technically a war crime.  As was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLjkPX4fXdw\">video</a> of the hostages being moved throughout the hospital on 10/7. That said, given the U.S. and Israeli claims that the hospital contained a major C2 node for Hamas, it’s probably going to take additional evidence-such as video of the actual tunnels under the hospital-to buttress the intelligence claims and assuage some of the international concerns about the Israeli moves on the hospital.  Ultimately, corroborating the intelligence gives Israel more runway diplomatically to prosecute the war in Gaza. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?&nbsp;
