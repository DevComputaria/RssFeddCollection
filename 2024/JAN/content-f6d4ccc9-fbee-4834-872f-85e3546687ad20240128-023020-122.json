Like a digital version of the “Nutrition Facts” on the sides of your cereal boxes and other food you buy. With a quick look, you could see what the company behind that app, device, or website collects — and what they do with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sadly, no such label exists. The fact of privacy today is that it takes work to uncover how the apps, devices, and websites you use collect your personal data and info. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">To uncover those details, you’ll find yourself wading through privacy policies, which are known for their thick legalese. And they can get rather vague. Words like “may” and “might” leave the door open for what companies really do with the personal info and data they collect. They “may” share it with other parties and they “might” sell it to other parties as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Meanwhile, those other parties “may” or “might” use it for their own purposes. Other parties that are largely unknown to you, if not completely unknown, because they’re undisclosed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As a result, once your personal data and info gets out there, it has a way of getting around.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Data and info collection powers the internet, which counts as yet one more fact of privacy. Yet that collection has its legal and ethical boundaries. And those boundaries stand front and center once again this Data Privacy Day. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Data Privacy Day gives us a chance to consider the importance of respecting privacy, of protecting data, and of building trust. Particularly on the internet, where data is the coin of the realm. It holds great value. Companies want it to improve their services and marketing. Bad actors want it to commit fraud and theft — or sell it on dark marketplaces.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Your clutch of personal data and info has a price tag hanging on it. That makes it worth protecting.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Granted, we think about privacy every day. The value it has. The importance of protecting it. And how we can make that protection it stronger and easier for you. That’s very much on our minds in a time where people say they have little idea about what personal data and info gets collected. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Indeed, plenty of people are scratching their heads about their privacy online. Findings from Pew Research in 2023 showed that roughly three-quarters of Americans surveyed said they feel like they have little or no control over data collection</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"><sup>i</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Moreover, 67% of them said they understand little to nothing about what companies are doing with their personal data. That’s up 8% from 59% in 2019</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"><sup>ii</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In four short years, more people feel like protecting their privacy is out of their hands. Even the ripple effects of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"><sup>iii</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> and strong consumer privacy laws in a dozen or so U.S. states</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"><sup>iv</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> haven’t increased their confidence. Only 61% of Americans feel that anything they do will make much difference when it comes to managing their privacy online</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"><sup>v</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet something else has happened in those four years. Online protection software has become more powerful. Particularly when it comes to privacy. Even if things feel otherwise, you truly can take significant steps that make a difference in your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As far as our online protection software goes, it offers several simple and powerful ways to protect your privacy. </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/family.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> features </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com.mcas.ms/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com.mcas.ms/learn/online-account-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online Account Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> — two ways you can take control of your data and info.

That keeps you anonymous from advertisers and other data collectors, all while securing you from other prying eyes online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Those handful of features, part of your overall identity and virus protection, can make you far more private. Even in a time of opaque privacy policies and heavy data collection online. Once again, our aim is to make that simple and powerful for you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It really is too bad there’s not a label for privacy. Sure, it’d be nice if you could peer into the Privacy Facts of the apps, devices, and websites you use. But the good news is that online protection software can put you in control of your personal data and info without those details. You truly are in more charge of your privacy than you might feel nowadays.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>[i] <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-data-and-digital-privacy-laws/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-data-and-digital-privacy-laws/</a></p>\n<p>[ii] <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/</a></p>\n<p>[iii] <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/</a></p>\n<p>[iv] <a href=\"https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/state-privacy-legislation-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/state-privacy-legislation-tracker/</a></p>\n<p>[v] <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-data-and-digital-privacy-laws/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-data-and-digital-privacy-laws/</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/protect-what-matters-on-data-privacy-day/\">Protect What Matters on Data Privacy Day</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"26 Billion Records Released in “The mother of all breaches”","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/26-billion-records-released-the-mother-of-all-breaches/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jasdev Dhaliwal"},"pubDate":"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 02:53:56 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=181211"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Security researchers have discovered a massive data breach containing more than 26 billion records — a hacker’s trove of records...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/26-billion-records-released-the-mother-of-all-breaches/\">26 Billion Records Released in “The mother of all breaches”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_Mother-of-All-Breaches-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>Security researchers have discovered a massive data breach containing more than 26 billion records — a hacker’s trove of records compiled from LinkedIn, Twitter, Adobe, and thousands of other organizations. Likely the largest of its kind, researchers have dubbed it MOAB or the “Mother of All Breaches.”</p>\n<p>With billions of pieces of personal info compromised, you can count on one thing here for sure. Bad actors out there will surely take advantage of this windfall. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\">We’ll share the immediate steps you can take to stay safe.</a></p>\n<h2>How big is the MOAB breach?</h2>\n<p>Just to get a sense of the breach&#8217;s scope, the newly discovered database contains over 3,800 folders, each containing records from an individual data breach. As such, it seems that these breached records were compiled over time to create this database.</p>\n<p>Within that list of 3,800 folders, it includes major brands and entities such as Twitter/X (281 million records), LinkedIn (251 million records), Evite (179 million records), and Adobe (153 million records). Leading the way with breached records is Tencent, with 1.5 billion records exposed.</p>\n<p>Researchers also discovered that the leak contains records from government organizations in the US, Brazil, Germany, Philippines, Turkey, and other countries.</p>\n<p>To date, no group has stepped forward to claim responsibility for this massive compilation of breached info. Researchers speculate that it could be a “malicious actor, data broker, or some service that works with large amounts of data.”</p>\n<h2>What can I do to protect myself in the wake of the MOAB breach?</h2>\n<p>Given the scale of the breach, your best bet is to act like your data was caught up in it.</p>\n<p>This breach truly is a treasure trove for hackers and scammers. With the info contained in it, they can launch follow-on attacks. Like identity theft, phishing attempts, and password-stuffing attacks often follow in the wake of breaches. And indeed, this is a massive breach.</p>\n<p>We can’t stress enough that acting now is super important.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHbyeSqbQ4U?si=_bkIgiaiy4qDuySb\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Immediate steps include:</p>\n<h3>Change your passwords and use a password manager.</h3>\n<p>Changing passwords now is a must. Strong and unique passwords are best, which means never reusing your passwords across different sites and platforms. Using a password manager will help you keep on top of it all, while also storing your passwords securely. Moreover, changing your passwords regularly might make a stolen password worthless because it’s out of date.</p>\n<h3>Enable two-factor authentication.</h3>\n<p>While a strong and unique password is a good first line of defense, enabling two-factor authentication across your accounts will help your cause by providing an added layer of security. It’s increasingly common to see nowadays, where banks and all manner of online services will only allow access to your accounts after you’ve provided a one-time passcode sent to your email or smartphone. If your accounts support two-factor authentication, enable it.</p>\n<h3>Consider using identity monitoring, particularly for the dark web.</h3>\n<p>An<a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\"> identity monitoring service</a> can monitor everything from email addresses to IDs and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft.​ Personal info harvested from data breaches can end up on dark web marketplaces where other bad actors buy it for their own attacks. Ours monitors the dark web for your personal info and provides early notifications if your data is found on there, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​ We also provide guidance to help you act if your info is found.</p>\n<h3>Check your credit, consider a security freeze, and get ID theft protection.</h3>\n<p>When personal info gets released, there’s a chance that a hacker, scammer, or thief will put it to use. This might include committing fraud, where they draw funds from existing accounts, and theft, where they create new accounts in a victim’s name.</p>\n<p>With that, strongly consider taking preventive measures now. Checking your credit, putting a security freeze in place, and getting theft protection can help keep you safe in the wake of a breach. You can get all three in place with our McAfee+ Advanced or Ultimate plans. Features include:</p>\n<p>Credit monitoring keeps an eye on changes to your credit score, report, and accounts with timely notifications and guidance so you can take action to tackle identity theft.</p>\n<p>Security freeze protects you proactively by stopping unauthorized access to existing credit card, bank, and utility accounts or from new ones being opened in your name. And it won’t affect your credit score.</p>\n<p>ID Theft &amp; Restoration Coverage gives you $2 million in identity theft coverage and identity restoration support if determined you’re a victim of identity theft.​ This way, you can cover losses and repair your credit and identity with a licensed recovery expert.</p>\n<h3>Also consider using comprehensive online protection.</h3>\n<p>A complete suite of online protection software can offer layers of extra security. In addition to password management and identity theft protection, it includes AI-powered scam detection that can spot scam texts, emails, and links on social media that otherwise look legit. If you accidentally tap or click on a sketchy link? Don’t worry, it can block those links from taking you to risky sites too. In all, online protection software offers you a broad range of defenses and preventative measures any time data breaches occur. Even breaches the size of the MOAB breach.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/26-billion-records-released-the-mother-of-all-breaches/\">26 Billion Records Released in “The mother of all breaches”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"From Email to RAT: Deciphering a VB Script-Driven Campaign","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/from-email-to-rat-deciphering-a-vb-script-driven-campaign/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 18:41:22 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=180519"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Authored by Preksha Saxena and Yashvi Shah McAfee Labs has been tracking a sophisticated VBS campaign characterized by obfuscated Visual...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/from-email-to-rat-deciphering-a-vb-script-driven-campaign/\">From Email to RAT: Deciphering a VB Script-Driven Campaign</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/300x200_Blog_032323-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><em>Authored by Preksha Saxena and Yashvi Shah</em></p>\n<p>McAfee Labs has been tracking a sophisticated VBS campaign characterized by obfuscated Visual Basic Scripting (VBS). Initially delivering the AgentTesla malware, the campaign has evolved into a multi-faceted threat, employing VBS scripts as a versatile delivery mechanism. Notably, this campaign extends beyond AgentTesla, now distributing a range of malware such as Guloader, Remcos RAT, Xworm, and Lokibot.</p>\n<p>This campaign illustrates a comprehensive infection process initiated by a VBS file delivered via email. Starting with the activation of a VBS script, it progresses through PowerShell phases, utilizing the BitsTransfer utility for fetching a second-stage PowerShell script. The decoded and executed Shellcode A conceals and loads Shellcode B. In the final phase, wab.exe downloads the encrypted Remcos RAT payload. Shellcode B decrypts and injects it into wab.exe, making it function as the Remcos RAT.</p>\n<p>The observed campaign has been noted for targeting diverse regions worldwide.

The process begins with the activation of a VBS script, initiating the initial PowerShell phase. Subsequently, the BitsTransfer utility is used to fetch a second-stage PowerShell script, encoded in base64. After decoding and execution, the first Shellcode is carefully extracted and loaded reflectively. Simultaneously, Shellcode A conceals and loads the decoded Shellcode B.</p>\n<p>In the final phase, the injected wab.exe proceeds to download the encrypted final payload of the Remcos RAT. Shellcode B is responsible for decrypting the payload, and it is subsequently injected into wab.exe. Consequently, this particular instance of wab.exe functions as the Remcos RAT.</p>\n<p><strong>VBScript in the Windows Environment: A Security Perspective</strong></p>\n<p>VBScript, introduced by Microsoft in 1996, was crucial in the Windows environment as a scripting language for task automation, tightly integrated with Internet Explorer, and a key component of technologies like Windows Script Host, Active Server Pages, and Office automation. It provided a simple scripting solution for system tasks, web development, and server-side logic. Microsoft is deprecating VBScript, and it will be available as a feature on-demand before eventual removal from Windows, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features\">said</a> the company. This decision aligns with a broader strategy to reduce malware campaigns exploiting Windows and Office features. VBScript, disabled by default in Internet Explorer 11 since 2019, has been used by malicious actors for distributing malware, and Microsoft aims to enhance security by eliminating this infection vector. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in phased-out technologies due to lingering use in legacy systems, slow adoption of updates, custom applications, stringent industry requirements, and user resistance to change. To mitigate risks, proactive measures such as prompt updates, security education, and staying informed about software lifecycles are crucial.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>\n<p>Avoiding falling victim to email phishing involves adopting a vigilant and cautious approach.

All it takes is a $9.96 shipping fee. Paid for by credit or debit card. Once in the hands of the scammers, the cards get charged, and sometimes charged repeatedly.

As we’ve reported previously, 2023 saw numerous celebrity AI cloning scams that hawked bogus goods, crooked investment scams, and phony cryptocurrency deals.

How are we to tell what’s real and what’s fake online? <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=509b05a3-65e9-46d4-9f17-2dbc606e111a\">Our Project Mockingbird</a> points to the answer. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We just unveiled <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=509b05a3-65e9-46d4-9f17-2dbc606e111a\">Project Mockingbird at the CES tech show in Las Vegas</a>, a new technology that helps detect AI-generated audio in deepfakes. Think of it as a lie detector that spots fake news and other schemes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">See for yourself. We ran video of the Taylor Swift cookware scam through our Project Mockingbird technology. You’ll see red lines spike as it detects cloned audio, which shows you to what degree the audio is real or fake, all along a charted timeline. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9tNqF6IQwY?si=JCqrwSGr3-eA0giT\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In addition to spotting celebrity scams, this approach to AI clone detection combats another particularly popular form of deepfake. The AI wrapper scam, where scammers wrap their cloned speech inside an otherwise legitimate video. Check out the example below. Here, scammers used clips of real news presenters to dress up their ChatGPT investment scam video.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIbqiW-kmaY?si=EQcvUug3bQJ6wRb2\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Note how the detector registered at the baseline when the news presenters spoke, which indicates authentic audio.

In addition to AI audio detection, we’re working on technology for image detection, video detection, and text detection as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With these capabilities, we’ll put the power of knowing what is real or fake directly into your hands. Another way you can think about it is that McAfee is like having a lie detector in your back pocket. With it, you’ll know what’s real and what’s fake online. Something we’ll all need more and more as AI technologies mature.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Looking ahead, we’ll see more than celebrity scams. We’ll see AI voice clones used to trick family members into sending money as part of phony emergency message scams. We’ll see it used for cyberbullying. And we’ll see bad actors use it to twist political speech across 2024’s major election cycles worldwide. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Through it all, we aim to give you the power of trust — to trust what you see and hear online.

Even if it’s something as innocuous as a smart wall outlet. The reason is, your home network is only as strong as its weakest security link. And many smart devices don’t come with the best security out of the box. Hackers know this. By compromising a device like a smart wall outlet, a hacker can gain access to the rest of the network and the devices and data on it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But how do you protect a smart wall outlet, along with that smart coffeemaker, door lock, and refrigerator?

Whether it’s a new Wi-Fi router, smartwatch, or even a connected fridge, they can all benefit from the following basics. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Use strong, unique passwords.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When it’s time to set up a new account or device, go with a strong, unique password. Strong means a mix of at least 12 characters, if not more. That includes a mix of numbers, symbols, and both letter cases, upper and lower. Unique means you don’t repeat it across accounts. That way, if one password gets compromised, the rest will remain secure. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Why strong and unique? Given today’s computing power, a hacker’s password generator can create millions of passwords in seconds. Weak passwords have no chance against them.

So just as you do for your other devices and accounts, create a fresh username and pair it with a strong, unique password as outlined above.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Upgrade to a newer internet router</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, older routers might have outdated security measures, which might make them more prone to attacks. If you’re renting yours from your internet provider, contact them for an upgrade. If you’re using your own, visit a reputable news or review site such as Consumer Reports for a list of the best routers that combine speed, capacity, and security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Set up a guest network specifically for your IoT devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Just as you can offer your guests secure access that’s separate from your own devices, creating an additional network on your router allows you to keep your computers and smartphones separate from IoT devices.

When it’s time for your actual appointment, pick a place in your home where you can ensure yourself some privacy. (Of course, don’t go online for your virtual appointment in a public place.)

The same goes for their privacy policies. Reading the privacy policy will tell you what kind of data the device collects.

Likewise, you can factor what you find into your purchasing decision.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Adjust the privacy settings</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This will vary from device to device as well, yet one more way you can lock down your privacy is in the device settings. Look for options around location tracking, social media sharing, and what types of data are shared online in addition to the device. Overall, consider what kind of fitness data it gathers and where it goes. If you’re not comfortable with that data ending up in the hands of a stranger, make it private.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">When upgrading to a new device, wipe your old one.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Along the same lines, that old wearable of yours might be chock full of data.

Smartphones and mobile devices like them need protection too — in their own right, and because they connect to so much more.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Avoid third-party app stores</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Google Play and Apple’s App Store have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure. Third-party sites might very well not, and they might intentionally host malicious apps as part of a front. Further, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps from their stores when discovered, making shopping there safer still. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Review apps carefully</span></b></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Check out the developer — have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps might have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors themselves. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keep an eye on app permissions</span></b></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another way hackers weasel their way into your device is by getting permissions to access things like your location, contacts, and photos — and they’ll use malicious apps to do it. If an app asks for way more than you bargained for, like a simple puzzle game that asks for access to your camera or microphone, it might be a scam. Delete the app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Lock your phone — and keep an eye on it too</span></b></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Some bad actors will try to install spyware on phones themselves.

Locking your phone and always keeping it close can help prevent bad actors from infecting your phone this way.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another step you can take is to familiarize yourself with the remote locking and wiping features of your mobile device.

From AI apps that help ease loneliness thanks to their human-like conversations, to technology that can predict and manage health risks, to browsers that whip up pieces of art with a prompt, it’s changing the way we go about our day and the way we live our lives. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">However, we find ourselves only in generative AI’s earliest days. Countless more applications await over the near and distant horizon alike.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet that’s the important thing to remember with AI. It’s an application. A tool. And like any other tool, it’s neutral. Whether it helps or harms comes down to the person using it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Thus, on the flip side of AI, we’ve seen all manner of shady and damaging applications. Hackers use AI to code new forms of malware at record rates. Scammers spin up convincing-looking phishing attacks and sites that harvest personal info, also at record rates. And we’ve further seen bad actors use so-called “deepfake” technologies to clone the voices and likenesses of public figures, whether for profit or to spread disinformation.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, amid the excitement about AI, there runs a thread of uncertainty. Recently, we found that 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI in daily life. Only 10% of people said they’re more excited than concerned. Meanwhile, 36% feel a mix of excitement and concern.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Uncertainty prevails, for sure. Yet something often gets overlooked in the conversation about AI: it can offer powerful protections against all manner of threats. Moreover, AI offers particularly potent protections against AI threats. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In this way, AI is your ally. At McAfee, we’ve used it to protect you for nearly a decade now. In fact, AI applications have been around for some time, long before they made headlines like they do now. And we continue to evolve AI technologies to help keep you safe. In the age of AI, McAfee is your ally. Our aim is to give you certainty and safety in rapidly changing times.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Know what’s real and what’s safe with McAfee’s AI.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ultimately, here’s what’s at stake today: people want to know what they can trust, and AI has made that tricky. What’s real? What’s fake? It’s getting tougher and tougher to tell.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The future of AI and online safety lies in pairing progress with protection. Here at McAfee, we see this as our role. We&#8217;re evolving AI in ways that give people the power to protect their privacy, identity, and devices even better than before. Now, that protection extends yet further. It also gives them the power to know what they can trust whenever they go online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The time couldn’t be more right for that.

Our AI has sniffed out viruses, malicious websites, and sketchy content online. It’s helped steer you clear of malicious websites too. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, the AI you have in your McAfee antivirus, it works like this:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">It detects threats by referencing models of existing threats.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> This combats pre-existing threats and entirely new (zero-day) threats alike. Our AI can spot varieties of different threats by comparing them to features it’s seen before. For example, it’s like AI learning to identify different varieties of fruit. An apple is still an apple whether it’s a Fuji or Granny Smith. In that way, a virus is still a virus if it’s “Virus A” or the newly discovered “Virus Z.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:256}\"> </span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">It further detects suspicious events and behaviors.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> AI provides a particularly powerful tool against zero-day threats. It analyzes the activities of applications for patterns consistent with malicious behavior. With that, it can spot and prevent a previously unknown file or process from doing harm. In its way, AI says, “I’ve seen this sketchy behavior before. I’m going to flag it.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:256}\"> </span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">It automatically classifies threats and adds them to its body of knowledge. </span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\">AI-driven threat protection gets stronger over time. Because it learns. Something we call “threat intelligence.” The more threats it encounters, the more rapidly and readily it can determine if files want to do you no good. The body of threat intelligence improves immensely as a result.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:256}\"> </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now we’ve made improvements to our AI-driven protection — and unveiled all-new features that take full advantage of AI, such as <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\">McAfee Next-gen Threat Protection and McAfee Scam Protection</a>.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee Next-gen Threat Protection — AI keeps you safer from new and existing threats. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee’s AI-powered security just got faster and stronger.

And that mix reflects the nature of cybersecurity. Just as changing technology shapes cybersecurity, it gets further shaped by the changing world we live in. The bad actors out there exploit new and emerging technologies — just as they exploit events and trends. It’s a potent formula that bad actors turn to again and again. With it, they concoct a mix of ever-evolving attacks.</p>\n<p>For a pointed example of the interplay between technology and culture, look no further than Barbie.

Across the globe, we have the United States presidential election, general elections in India, and the European Union parliamentary elections, to name a few. While every election comes with its fair share of disinformation, the continued evolution of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion add an extra level of complication.</p>\n<p>So, if a picture is worth a thousand words, what’s an AI-generated photo, video, or voice clone worth? For disinformation, plenty.</p>\n<p>Already, many voters raise a skeptical brow when politicians sling statements aimed at discrediting their opponents. Yet when those words are backed by visual evidence, such as a photo or video, it lends them the appearance of credibility. With AI tools, a few keywords can give a false statement or accusation life in the form of a (bogus) photo or video, which now go by the common name of “deepfakes.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, 2024 won’t be the first election where bad actors or unscrupulous individuals try to shape public opinion through the manipulation of photos and videos. However, it will be the first election where generative AI tools are significantly more accessible and easier than ever to use. As a result, voters can expect to see a glut of deepfakes and disinformation as the election cycle gears up.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the advent of AI voice-cloning tools complicates matters yet more. Consider what that means for the pre-recorded “robocalls” that campaigns use to reach voters en masse. Now, with only a small sample of a candidate’s voice, bad actors can create AI voice clones with striking fidelity. They read from any script a bad actor bangs out and effectively put words in someone else’s mouth — potentially damaging the reputation and credibility of candidates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/artificial-imposters-cybercriminals-turn-to-ai-voice-cloning-for-a-new-breed-of-scam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As we reported earlier this year</a>, AI voice cloning is easier and more accessible than ever. It stands to reason that bad actors will turn it to political ends in 2024.</p>\n<h2>How to spot disinformation.</h2>\n<p>Disinformation has several goals, depending on who’s serving it up. Most broadly, it involves gain for one group at the expense of others. It aims to confuse, misdirect, and manipulate its audience — often by needling strong emotional triggers. That calls on us to carefully consider the media and messages we see, particularly in the heat of the moment.</p>\n<p>That can present challenges at a time when massive amounts of content scroll by our eyes in our subscriptions and feeds. Bad actors count on people taking content at immediate face value. Yet asking a few questions can help you spot disinformation when you see it.</p>\n<p>The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions offers this checklist:</p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consider the Source </span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8211; Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission, and its contact info.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Read Beyond</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> &#8211; Headlines can be outrageous to get clicks.

While not every piece of controversial or upsetting piece of content is disinformation, those are surefire signs to follow up on what you’ve seen with several credible sources. Also, keep in mind that those bad actors out there want you to do their dirty work for them. They want you to share their content without a second thought. By taking a moment to check the facts before you react, curb the dissent they want to see spread.</p>\n<h2>2) AI scams will be the new sneaky stars of social media.</h2>\n<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybercrime, the emergence of AI has introduced a new level of sophistication and danger. With the help of AI, cybercriminals now possess the ability to manipulate social media platforms and shape public opinion in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects of this development is the power of AI tools to fabricate photos, videos, and audio. These tools enable bad actors to create highly convincing and realistic content, making it increasingly difficult for users to discern between what is real and what is manipulated. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for cybercriminals to exploit unsuspecting individuals and organizations.</p>\n<p>One alarming consequence of this is the potential for celebrity and influencer names and images to be misused by cybercrooks. With the ability to generate highly convincing content, these bad actors can create fake endorsements that appear to come from well-known personalities. This can lead to an increase in scams and fraudulent activities, as unsuspecting consumers may be more likely to trust and engage with content that appears to be endorsed by their favorite celebrities or influencers.</p>\n<p>Local online marketplaces are also at risk of being targeted by cybercriminals utilizing AI. By leveraging fabricated content, these bad actors can create fake listings and advertisements that appear legitimate. This can deceive consumers into making purchases or engaging in transactions that ultimately result in financial loss or other negative consequences.</p>\n<h2>How to avoid AI social media scams</h2>\n<p>As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions. This includes being vigilant and skeptical of content encountered on social media platforms, verifying the authenticity of endorsements or advertisements, and utilizing secure online marketplaces with robust verification processes.</p>\n<h2>3) Cyberbullying among kids will soar</h2>\n<p>One of the most troubling trends on the horizon for 2024 is the alarming rise of cyberbullying, which is expected to be further exacerbated by the increasing use of deepfake technology. This advanced and remotely accessible tool has become readily available to young adults, enabling them to create exceptionally realistic fake content with ease.</p>\n<p>In the past, <a href=\"https://media.mcafeeassets.com/content/dam/npcld/ecommerce/en-us/docs/reports/rp-cyberbullying-in-plain-sight-2022-global.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cyberbullies primarily relied on spreading rumors</a> and engaging in online harassment. However, with the emergence of deepfake technology, the scope and impact of cyberbullying have reached new heights. Cyberbullies can now manipulate images that are readily available in the public domain, altering them to create fabricated and explicit versions. These manipulated images are then reposted online, intensifying the harm inflicted on their victims.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this escalating trend are far-reaching and deeply concerning. The false images and accompanying words can have significant and lasting effects on the targeted individuals and their families. Privacy becomes compromised as personal images are distorted and shared without consent, leaving victims feeling violated and exposed. Moreover, the fabricated content can tarnish one&#8217;s identity, leading to confusion, mistrust, and damage to personal and professional relationships.</p>\n<p>The psychological and emotional well-being of those affected by deepfake cyberbullying is also at stake. The relentless onslaught of false and explicit content can cause severe distress, anxiety, and depression. Victims may experience a loss of self-esteem, as they struggle to differentiate between reality and the manipulated content that is being circulated online. The impact on their mental health can be long-lasting, requiring extensive support and intervention.</p>\n<p>The ripple effects of deepfake cyberbullying extend beyond the immediate victims. Families are also deeply affected, as they witness the distress and suffering of their loved ones. Parents may feel helpless and overwhelmed, struggling to protect their children from the relentless onslaught of cyberbullying. The emotional toll on families can be immense, as they navigate the challenges of supporting their children through such traumatic experiences.</p>\n<h2>How to prevent online cyberbullying.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"9\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Education and Awareness:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Promote digital literacy and educate individuals about the consequences and impact of cyberbullying.

Darkly, they also tap into fear and grief.</p>\n<p>A particularly heartless method of doing this is through charity fraud. While this takes many forms, it usually involves a criminal setting up a fake charity site or page to trick well-meaning contributors into thinking they are supporting legitimate causes or contributing money to help fight real issues.</p>\n<p>2024 will see this continue. We further see potential for this to increase given the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

This extends to the creation of deepfake video, photo, and audio content aimed at deceiving unsuspecting targets and scamming them out of money. The rise of QR code scams, also known as quishing, is an additional concern. Scammers use AI to generate malicious QR codes that, when scanned, lead to phishing websites or trigger malware downloads.

Look for plenty of them with the 2024 Summer Olympics.</p>\n<p>An event with this level of global appeal attracts scammers looking to capitalize on the excitement. They promise tickets, merch, and exclusive streams to events, among other things. Yet they take a chunk out of your wallet and steal personal info instead.</p>\n<p>You can expect to see a glut of email-based phishing and message-based smishing attacks. Now, with the introduction of generative AI, these scams are getting harder and harder to identify. AI writes cleaner emails and messages, so fewer scams feature the traditional hallmarks of misspelled words and poor grammar. Combine that with the excitement generated around the Olympic games, and we can easily see how people might be tempted by bogus sweepstakes and offers for the Olympics trip of a lifetime. If they only click or tap that link. Which of course leads to a scam website.</p>\n<p>You can expect these messages to crop up across a variety of channels, including email, text messages, and other messaging channels like WhatsApp and Telegram. They might slide into social media DMs as well.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning to catch the Olympic action in person, scammers have a plan in mind for you — ticket fraud. As we’ve seen at the FIFA World Cup and several other major sporting events over the years, scammers spin up scam ticket sites with tickets to all kinds of matches and events. Again, these sites don’t deliver. These sites can look rather professional, yet if the site only accepts cryptocurrency or wire transfers, you can be certain it’s fraud. Neither form of payment offers a way to challenge charges or recoup losses.</p>\n<h2>How to enjoy the 2024 Olympics safely.</h2>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"5\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing and smishing attacks can take a little effort to spot.

Dubbed Android/Xamalicious it tries to gain accessibility privileges with social engineering and then it communicates with the command-and-control server to evaluate whether or not to download a second-stage payload that’s dynamically injected as an assembly DLL at runtime level to take full control of the device and potentially perform fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps among other actions financially motivated without user consent.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The second stage payload can take full control of the infected device due to the powerful accessibility services that were already granted during the first stage which also contains functions to self-update the main APK which means that it has the potential to perform any type of activity like a spyware or banking trojan without user interaction.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> However, we identified a link between Xamalicious and the ad-fraud app “Cash Magnet” which automatically clicks ads, installs apps, and other actions to fraudulently generate revenue while users that installed it may earn points that are supposed to be redeemable as a retail gift card. This means that the developers behind these threats are financially motivated and drive ad-fraud therefore this might be one of the main payloads of Xamalicious.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The usage of the Xamarin framework allowed malware authors to stay active and without detection for a long time, taking advantage of the build process for APK files that worked as a packer to hide the malicious code. In addition, malware authors also implemented different obfuscation techniques and custom encryption to exfiltrate data and communicate with the command-and-control server.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We’ve identified about 25 different malicious apps that carry this threat. Some variants have been distributed on Google Play since mid-2020. The apps identified in this report were proactively removed by Google from Google Play ahead of our reporting. McAfee is a member of the App Defense Alliance and an active partner in the malware mitigation program, which aims to quickly find Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) and stop them before they ever make it onto Google Play. Android users are protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users of identified malicious apps on Android devices.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/Xamalicious. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Based on the number of installations these apps may have compromised at least 327,000 devices from Google Play plus the installations coming from third-party markets that continually produce new infections based on the detection telemetry of McAfee clients around the world.

delete your personal info from the internet entirely, you can take strong steps to remove it from risky places. Several where others could tap into it for profit or harm.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Why is it so important to take control of our personal info? It has street value, and it has for some time now. Because so much of business, finance, healthcare, and life in general runs on it, your personal info has a dollar sign to it. Plenty of people want to get a hold of it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal info fuels targeted advertising and marketing campaigns, just as it helps adjusters set insurance rates and healthcare providers make projections about our well-being. Businesses want it for employment background checks. Law enforcement uses it when investigating persons of interest. Banks and credit card companies base their approvals on it. Websites and apps collect it for their own purposes, which they sometimes share or sell to third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And of course, hackers, scammers, and thieves want it too. To steal your identity, drain your accounts, and wage other attacks on you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">No doubt, your personal info has value. High value. And that makes a strong argument for doing what you can to control what you share and where you share it to the best possible degree. With so much that hinges on your personal info, it’s good to know that you can take control in powerful ways. We’ll show how it’s far easier to do that today than ever before.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Get to know your digital shadow.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Taking control of your personal info starts with a look at your digital shadow. Everyone casts one. And like everyone else’s digital shadow, yours gets filled with info about you — personal info stored online across the internet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For starters, your digital shadow includes things like posts in forums, social media profiles, the posts that you put up there, and other people’s posts that mention you. It includes other sources of info, like pictures of you in an online newsletter, your name listed in the standings of your co-ed soccer league, and a bio of you on your company’s “About Us” page. Online reviews provide potential sources too. In all, this part of your digital shadow grows larger in two ways — as you say more things, and as more things are said about you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Your shadow grows yet more with the addition of public records. That might include what you paid for your home, who lives there with you, your age, your children, your driving record, education, occupation, and estimated income. It all depends on where you live and what data regulations are in place there. Some regions have stricter privacy rules in place than others when it comes to public records. For example, in the U.S., California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Oregon, Montana, Texas, and Delaware have strong data privacy laws on the books</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. The European Union has its well-known GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation, in place</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Then there’s all manner of info about you gathered and sold by online data brokers. Data brokers pull hundreds of data points from public sources, not to mention private sources like supermarket club cards that track your shopping history. Other private sources include info from app developers and websites with less restrictive privacy policies when it comes to sharing and selling info. These data brokers sell personal info to anyone who’ll pay, including hackers, scammers, and spammers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Finally, a sizable swathe of your shadow comes from info stored on the deep web. It forms the 95% of the internet that’s not searchable. Yet, you likely take trips there daily. Any time you go through a paywall or use a password to access internet content, you’re entering the deep web. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Examples include logging into your bank account, accessing medical records through your healthcare provider, or using corporate web pages as part of your workday. Even streaming a show can involve a trip to the deep web. None of that content is searchable. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What’s in there, aside from your Netflix viewing history? Think of all the info that forms the basis of your credit score, your health history, your financial info, and all the info that websites and advertisers capture about you as you simply spend time online. That’s the deep web too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">A subset of the deep web is the dark web. It’s not searchable as well, and it requires a special browser to access. Some of the sites and data stores found there are entirely legitimate, others questionable, and several are outright illegal. Some of your info might be there too. And yes, you’ll find dark marketplaces here where bad actors put up personal info for sale.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Everyone online indeed has a digital shadow. And some shadows are longer than others.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Taking control of your personal info matters, perhaps more than you think.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, what’s the big deal? That’s how the internet works, right?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s a fair question. Part of the answer comes down to how important a person thinks their privacy is. Yet, more objectively, keeping a lower profile online offers better protection from cybercrime.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Consider research published by the science journal </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nature</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\">, in 2019. Here’s an excerpt from the authors:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Using our model, we find that 99.98% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes. Our results suggest that even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are unlikely to satisfy the modern standards for anonymization set forth by GDPR [Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation] and seriously challenge the technical and legal adequacy of the de-identification release-and-forget model.</span></i></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Put in practical terms, imagine a hacker or snoop gets their hands on a large set of public or private data. Like say, health data about certain medical conditions. Even though that data has been “scrubbed” to make the people in it anonymous, that hacker or snoop only needs 15 pieces of info to identify you in that mix. From there, they could pinpoint any health conditions linked to you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In a time when all kinds of organizations gather all kinds of data, the impact of this research finding is clear. Data breaches happen, and a determined person can spot you in a batch of breached data with relative ease. They have several tools readily available that can cobble together those other 15 pieces of info to identify you. That further strengthens the argument for taking control of your personal info.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Deleting your info on the internet has its benefits.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Shortening your so-called digital shadow helps improve everyday life in several ways. It can:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cut down the number of sketchy texts, emails, and calls you get. </span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\">If a hacker, scammer, or spammer can’t track down your contact info, they can’t reach you on your computers and phones. Removing info from data broker sites, old accounts you no longer use, and even social media can make it harder for them to reach you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Reduce the risk of identity crimes, like theft, fraud, and harassment.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Bad actors turn people’s info against them. With it, they take out loans in other people’s names, file bogus insurance claims, and, in more extreme cases, impersonate others for employment or criminal purposes. When you have less info online, they have less info to work with. That makes their attacks tougher to pull off. So tough that they might turn to another, easier target who has much more info online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keep snoops out of your business when taking care of things online.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Tracking and monitoring are simple facts of going online. Sites and businesses do it for performance and marketing purposes. Hackers and bad actors do it for outright theft. Taking steps to mask and outright hide your activities online benefits your privacy and your security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Take control of what people do and don’t know about you.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Most broadly, increased privacy largely gives you the power to share your info. Not someone else. The fact is that many companies share info with other companies. And some of those other third parties might have looser data privacy and data security measures in place. What’s more, you likely have no idea who those third parties are. Increased privacy helps you take far more control of where your info does and doesn’t go.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Five ways you can delete your info from the internet.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The following can help:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1.

They </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> alter a familiar company name so that it looks like it </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> have come from that company.

Online protection software can help keep you safe as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to avoid QR code scams.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Luckily,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you can follow some basic rules and avoid QR code attacks. The U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) has put together a great list that can help</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Their advice is right on the mark, which we’ve paraphrased and added to here:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Don’t open links or scan QR codes from strangers.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Scammers send QR codes by email, over social media, and sometimes they even send them by physical mail as part of a “Special offer, just scan here” ploy. In all, if a QR code comes to you out of the blue, even from a friend, skip scanning it. See if you can type in a physical address to a site that you can trust instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Check the link and the destination.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Given that many QR codes lead to phishing sites, look at the link that pops up after you scan it. Scammers alter addresses for known websites in subtle ways — or that differ from them entirely. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">For example, they might use “fed-exdeliverynotices.com” rather than the legitimate fedex.com. Or they might use a scam URL followed by text that tries to make it look legit, like “scamsite.com/fedex-delivery.” (For more on how to spot phishing attacks, </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/plenty-of-phish-in-the-sea-your-guide-to-spotting-phishing-emails-and-scams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">check out our full article</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> on the topic.)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Think twice about following shortened links.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Shortened links can be a shortcut to a malicious website. This can particularly be the case with unsolicited communications. And it can still be the case with a friend or family member if their device or account has been hacked. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Watch out for tampering.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> In physical spaces, like parking lot signs, scammers have been known to stick their own QR codes over legitimate ones. If you see any sign of altering or a placement that looks slapdash, don’t give that code a scan.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5. Stick with your phone’s native QR code reader.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Steer clear of QR code reading apps. They can be a security risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6. Don’t pay bills with QR codes.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Once again, you can’t always be sure that the code will send you to a legit site. Use another trusted form of payment instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7. Use scam protection on your phone.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Using the power of AI, our new McAfee Scam Protection can alert you when scam texts pop up on your phone. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">And as a second line of defense, it can block risky sites if you accidentally follow a scam link in a text, email, social media, and more. </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">You’ll find it in our McAfee+ products</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> — along with </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-theft-coverage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">up to $2 million in identity theft coverage and restoration support</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> if the unfortunate happens to you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">QR codes—a handy, helpful tool that still calls for caution.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">QR codes have made transactions smoother and accessing helpful content on our phones much quicker. As such, we’re seeing them in plenty of places. And useful as they are like other means of paying or browsing online, keep an eye open when using them. With this advice as a guide, if something doesn’t feel right, keep your smartphone in your pocket and away from that QR code.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/click-protect-yourself-from-qr-code-scams/\">Click!

Scammers go after them all.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the U.S. and Canada, the Better Business Bureau (BBB), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre have issued warnings about several types of gift card scams floating around this time of year. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The scams fall under three broad categories:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Payment scams</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> — Here, gift card scams take their classic form. A scammer asks for payment with a gift card rather than a payment method a victim can contest, such as a credit card. When victims realize they’ve been scammed, they have no way of getting their money back.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Bogus balance-checking sites</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> — These sites promise to check the balance on gift cards. However, they’re phishing sites. Entering card info into these sites gives scammers everything they need to steal the card balance for themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift card tampering</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> — This involves draining gift cards of funds after they’re purchased. Organized crime rackets steal the cards from stores and then restock them on shelves — only after they’ve scanned the barcodes and pin numbers or altered them in some way. When a victim purchases and activates the card, the crooks launder the money and leave the victim with an empty card.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Why all this focus on gift cards? They truly are as good as cash. When that money is gone, it’s gone. Yet better, it can get whisked away electronically quicker than the quickest of pickpockets. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fortunately, you can avoid these scams rather easily when you know what to look for. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift card scams — just how bad is it out there?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Not great. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), they received nearly 50,000 reports of gift card fraud in 2022. Those losses racked up more than $250 million. Through September 2023, the BBB and FTC reported a 50% increase in cases of gift card scams over the same period in 2022</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. So far, that accounts for 29,000 reports and $147 million in losses — a figure that will surely climb much higher as October, November, and December roll by.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Affected cards include the usual list of well-known and reputable brands, such as Walmart, Target, Apple, Google, Amazon, Best Buy, and the Steam gaming platform. Back in 2021, Target gift cards racked up the biggest losses, an average of $2,500 per victim, according to the FTC.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Canada has seen a jump in reports as well. According to the BBB and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, January through August 2023 saw roughly 1,200 reports with $3.5 million in losses</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> for an average loss of roughly $2,900.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What are scammers asking people to pay for with gift cards?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you can imagine a transaction of any kind, a scammer will likely try to get you to pay </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">for it</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with gift cards.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some of the more striking examples include scammers who pose as dog breeders who take gift cards as advance payment. They also lurk in online marketplaces and local buy-sell groups, preying on victims looking to buy anything from furniture to golf carts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And as we’ve reported in the past, scammers often pose as government officials. In these cases, they level heavy threats and demand payment for fines and back taxes, all with gift cards. That’s </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a sure</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sign of a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some scammers go to greater lengths by setting up phony online stores that only accept payment with gift cards. One high-profile example — the phony ticket sites for major sporting events like the Super Bowl and World Cup. Many of those sites offered gift cards as a payment option. In other instances, scammers set up similar bogus storefronts that sell lower-priced items like clothing and bags.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Lastly, we come around to those gift card </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">balance-checking</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sites, which are really phishing sites.

The</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> phishing site is on the right. Note how Target is spelled as “Targets” in the ad, and the address on the phishing site is entirely different than Target.com. Yet that doesn’t stop the scammer from asking for all the info they need to steal funds from the card a victim enters.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to avoid gift card scams.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Bottom line, if anyone, anywhere, asks you to pay for goods, services, or debts of any kind with a gift card, it’s a scam. Additionally, here’s further advice from us and the BBB:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Remember that gift cards are for gifts. Never for payments.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This reinforces the advice above. The crooks who run gift card scams pose as utility companies, the government, lottery officials, tech support from big-name companies, even family members — just about anyone. Yet what all these scams have in common is urgency. Scammers use high-pressure tactics to trick victims into paying with gift cards.  And paying quickly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Look for signs of tampering with your physical gift card.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Earlier we mentioned gift card </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">tampering,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> where scammers either copy or alter the card </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">info</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and then steal funds when the card is purchased. Signs of tampering include a bar code that’s affixed to the card with a sticker, </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a PIN</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that’s been exposed, or packaging that looks like it’s been altered in any way. If possible, purchase gift cards that are behind a counter where they are monitored. This can decrease the risk of purchasing a gift card that’s been tampered with. Also, save your receipt in the event of an issue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Several reputable retailers and brands offer them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

If the brand or retailer issuing the card allows you to register the card, do so. And if it further allows you to change the PIN, do that as well. This way, you can report card theft with an eye to getting your money back — while changing the PIN can help keep scammers from using the card altogether.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What can I do if I fall for a gift card scam?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you fall victim to a scam, report it.

Once installed, the banking trojan can collect personal and financial information plus intercept SMS messages with the objective of stealing one-time passwords or verification codes that are required to complete transactions which may lead to stealing the banking account assets.</p>\n<p>This trojan is just a variant and example of multiple banking trojans implementations recently observed in the wild that carry similar risks, which is not technically sophisticated but might be very effective and prevalent especially when it’s widely distributed on social media. McAfee Mobile Security protects broadly and generically against this type of banking trojans.</p>\n<p>This blog explores the insidious tactics, alarming trends, and preventive measures against the rising tide of phishing attacks plaguing Android users in India’s financial landscape.</p>\n<h2>Distribution Method: Messaging platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial lure is an alarming WhatsApp message prompting the user to download an Android Package (APK) to complete a mandatory verification procedure carried out by financial institutions known as Know Your Customer (KYC) else the account would be blocked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-178889 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"438\" height=\"779\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure_1-1.png 438w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure_1-1-169x300.png 169w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure_1-1-73x129.png 73w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" /></strong></p>\n<p>A sense of urgency is created for the user by warning him that the account would be blocked if he doesn&#8217;t install the APK and provide the necessary information to complete the KYC form.</p>\n<p>These seemingly innocent prompts, meticulously crafted by cybercriminals, possess a cunning sophistication that mirrors the legitimate communication channels of banking institutions.

The first line of defense against these threats is the user’s awareness. Some generic advises are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid installing apps from third party sources, especially apps received by messaging apps.\n<ul>\n<li>Do not activate “install unknown apps” option on social media apps.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do not trust or click on messages received from untrusted sources in social media.</li>\n<li>For banking apps stick into the official website and officials’ apps stores</li>\n<li>If possible, use a reliable antivirus solution such as McAfee Mobile Security which generically protects against these types of threats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>McAfee Antivirus emerges as a formidable ally in the battle against Android phishing within India&#8217;s banking sector. With its robust suite of security features tailored for mobile devices, McAfee stands as a bulwark, providing critical defense mechanisms against the ever-mutating landscape of cyber threats.</p>\n<h2>Indicators Of compromise</h2>\n<table width=\"769\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">Hash</td>\n<td width=\"278\">Package</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">7cfc6360e69d22b09a28c940caf628959d11176e27b8a03e15b020b369569415</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">b067f5903e23288842ad056d4b31299b3b30052abe69bee236136b2b9fcab6a8</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">e2e097ef433be75dcab830baa4b08feb4a24267c46b568fd4aef00dbb081ed8f</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">9f046f769760d52a97680a91fd511f1e86c428b9eec27d7eb486b7b4d0666f0b</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">1c69b0a69ed1631a1f1b54627a9b5dac3b214a275280de36d05ee75021cbfb04</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">495ab4efd3d1ec9bfc2d08d80df316aad20dc76e625374627fabea06f5151584</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">6190144b56e06af8aeeeba2104a665a555d01f6ec2a22ba78212d943ac2b258d</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"491\">6c6ea9fbeae967fb53ab9984edda9b754fb6d3f85b4ff5b14e1fd33399362ba4</td>\n<td width=\"278\">hello.uwer.hello.hello.google.is.the.best</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Abused Firebase host : </u><em>Wss[:]//s-usc1a-nss-2003.firebaseio.com/.ws?v=5&amp;ns=zero-a4c52-default-rtdb </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/shielding-against-android-phishing-in-indian-banking/\">Shielding Against Android Phishing in Indian Banking</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How to Raise Responsible Digital Citizens","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-raise-responsible-digital-citizens/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 15:15:53 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Family Safety"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=178821"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>‘So, what is the ultimate goal of all of our parenting?’ When I asked this question to a group of...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-raise-responsible-digital-citizens/\">How to Raise Responsible Digital Citizens</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121523-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">‘So, what is the ultimate goal of all of our parenting?’ When I asked this question to a group of mum friends during the week, the answers were all quite mixed. ‘To raise kind humans’, one offered. &#8216;To have someone look after me when I’m old!&#8217;, said another.

But the earlier you start weaving in messages about responsibility and safety – the more automatic it will be for them to adopt a positive digital citizen mindset.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Raising Digital Citizens Means Raising Safe Citizens</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You’d be hard-pressed to find many parents who don’t worry about the risks of their kids being online. Whether it&#8217;s scams, online predators, or cyberbullying, unfortunately, there will always be some level of risk. And while many of us would love to remove our kids’ devices or better still, wrap our babies in cotton wool, this is just not a reality. So, in my opinion, the best way to protect them is to prepare them. I believe that if we take the time to help them develop into responsible and effective digital citizens then they are far more likely to make safe and responsible choices! A complete no-brainer!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What You Need To Teach Your Kids To Be Effective Digital Citizens</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Your Online Identity Is A Key Part of Your Identity</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is one lesson you don’t want your kids to learn the hard way! When tweens and teens are in the moment, it is easy to forget to think of the consequences of what they post. But one’s online presence is a significant part of their identity and can often be the first place that someone forms an impression of you. The manager of our local supermarket regularly tells me how he will first assess potential applicants with a quick ‘Google’ before he even offers an interview. And if your child is keen to be considered for a leadership position at school or university, it is imperative that they think about how they conduct themselves online too. Intentional, respectful interactions are the name of the game!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

So, encourage your child to extend the same level of respect to their online friends and acquaintances as they would to those they meet face-to-face. This means not creating or forwarding hurtful content and or getting involved in negative online discussions or gossip about anyone – no exceptions!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I’m a big fan of teaching your child to speak up if they experience or witness bullying. While they may think they can handle it on their own, having input from a trusted adult will make the situation feel more manageable and less overwhelming. Advise your kids to block anyone who does not treat them respectfully online – but always take screenshots first! Being proactive will help create a positive and supportive online experience.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Using others&#8217; work without obtaining their permission is both unethical and technically, against the law. This encompasses all forms of online content (aka intellectual property) including texts, images, and music. As parents, we need to foster digital citizenship in our kids by reminding them to appreciate the efforts and originality of fellow digital creators. In my opinion, giving credit when using others’ work is a ‘best practice’. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The ’do not copy’ rule also extends to piracy – the illegal downloading of digital content e.g. music or movies. Many kids dabble in piracy, but it really is no different to stealing someone’s work. Encourage your kids to treat the creative work of others with the same respect you would want for your own. And yes, that includes Taylor Swift!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

It can be a crushing moment. So, getting ahead of the game and teaching your kids to be cautiously suspicious about people, platforms, organisations and offers they come across online will hold them in great stead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Exercising caution when sharing information with strangers and unfamiliar organisations is an important way to protect yourself. Always do your due diligence before ‘trusting’ someone you connect with on a dating site, always request a legitimate way to transfer money when buying goods online and never just enter personal information on a site without doing your research.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We’ve all heard the expression ‘when something is too good to be true, it usually is’. This needs to be the golden rule when navigating the internet. Whether it’s early access to snippets from a yet to be released movie, a compelling discount on an iPhone or weight loss supplements, scammers know how to hook us in! </span><a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scamwatch</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is a great resource for identifying and reporting scams here in Australia. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If your child is uncertain about a website&#8217;s credibility, they can pose critical questions to themselves, such as &#8220;whose interests does this site serve?&#8221; or &#8220;how accurate and reliable is the information I&#8217;m reading?&#8221; This can guide your child in distinguishing between questionable sites and those providing accurate news and content.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But let me share one final piece of advice. We can encourage and educate our kids all day long about being a responsible digital citizen but unless we are modelling the behaviour we are trying to foster, it’s just not going to work. So, when you’re sharing a new post on Facebook, or commenting on a news article, ensure you are considerate and responsible with your word choice. Show your kids how to have kind and respectful interactions online and always fact-check any information you choose to share &#8211; because they are always watching and learning!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Happy parenting digital citizens!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-raise-responsible-digital-citizens/\">How to Raise Responsible Digital Citizens</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Five Ways To Protect Your Kids From Inappropriate Online Content","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/five-ways-to-protect-your-kids-from-inappropriate-online-content/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 17:34:26 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=178755"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121323.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121323.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_121323-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Inquisitive, curious and fiercely independent.

Set Ground Rules</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I am a big fan of a family tech agreement that outlines your expectations of your kids’ online behaviour and the family&#8217;s ‘rules of engagement.’ This should be age appropriate but if your kids are young enough then please include a list of the sites they can visit, the apps they can download and the information they can share – nothing personally identifiable. I would also include rules about device usage – no devices in bedrooms overnight!! Check out my post </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/why-you-need-to-get-a-family-technology-agreement-happening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">here</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that will help you tailor an agreement for your family. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A clear and detailed agreement means that every family member has clarity on the rules that will keep them safe. I find sharing the ‘why’ with my kids so important – so ensure they know you’re your goal here is to keep them safe and set them up for a positive online experience. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Communicate Regularly, Openly and Calmly</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Go out of your way to create a home environment when your kids feel comfortable talking and sharing about all aspects of their lives without judgement. Once you have this, then you will be able to have regular conversations that will help them better understand the online world and most importantly, keep them safe! The goal here is to have genuine 2-way conversations without them feeling like they are being lectured at. For example, you can explain that anything they share online creates their own ‘digital footprint’ so they need to be mindful of how they conduct themselves, You could also talk them through the dangers of spreading rumours online or sharing hurtful photos or jokes. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And if your kids know they can talk to you about anything and that you won’t overact, then they are more likely to tell you if they have seen something online that has worried them. Now, we all hope that doesn’t happen, but we all want to be able to help our kids navigate challenges if and when they arise.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

I do all the time! Our parents are our biggest influence and are our biggest role models. And this also applies to how we engage with technology. Make sure your kids see you enjoying tech-free time, so they ‘normalise’ this. Leave your phone at home when you walk the dog, never have phones at the dinner table and always turn your phone on do not disturb when talking with your kids. The less time spent on technology means the more time for real in-person human connection.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Being open is also an imperative way to protect your kids. In fact, the more open and communicative you are with your kids, the less reason they will have to undertake their own ‘research’ online. So, if you’ve created an environment where talking about puberty, hormonal changes and teenage relationships is normal, chances are they won’t need to turn to Google for answers – and risk seeing inappropriate content.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, if you have a tribe of curious tweens or teens, then I’m sending you my very best. It’s not an easy task protecting them from some of the more challenging content that the internet can offer. But having come out the other side – and survived – I can assure you that the more proactive you are, the easier the ride will be. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Good luck!!</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex XX</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">PS If you’re thinking about parental controls, don’t forget about enabling these on your streaming services too. </span><a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Netflix</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYBCCNGWAJFEUVG3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Amazon Prime</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and </span><a href=\"https://help.stan.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001564236-Parental-Controls-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Stan</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> all offer parental controls which can restrict the content that your kids can view.

We could solve the world’s problems if we just asked the algorithm how. Or it’s going to take your job and become too smart for its own good. The truth, as per usual, lies somewhere in between. AI will likely have plenty of positive impacts that do not change the world while also offering its fair share of negativity that isn’t society-threatening. To identify the happy medium requires answering some interesting questions about the appropriate use of AI. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Instead, we can focus on a use case that is becoming increasingly popular and democratized: generative AI assistants. By now, you’ve likely used ChatGPT or Bard or one of the dozens of platforms available to anyone with a computer. But can you prompt these algorithms and be wholly satisfied with what they spit out?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The short answer is, “no.” These </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fthe-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">chatbots are quite capable of hallucinations</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, instances where the AI will make up answers. The answers it provides come from the algorithm’s set of training data but may not actually be traceable back to real-life knowledge. Take the recent story of a lawyer who presented a brief in a courtroom. It turns out, he used ChatGPT to write the entire brief, wherein the AI cited fake cases to support the brief.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When it comes to AI, human oversight will likely always be necessary. Whether the model is analyzing weather patterns to predict rainfall or evaluating a business model, it can still make mistakes or even provide answers that do not make logical sense. Appropriate use of AI, especially with tools like ChatGPT and its ilk, requires a human fact checker.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

But, we can attempt to examine a narrower application of the question. Consider that many AI algorithms in the real-world have been found to exhibit discriminatory behavior. For example, one AI had a much larger error rate depending on the sex or race of subjects. Another incorrectly classified inmate risk, leading to disproportionate rates of recidivism.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><sup>2</sup></span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, can those who write these algorithms fix these concerns once the model is live? Yes, engineers can always revisit their code and attempt to adjust after publishing their models. However, the process of evaluating and auditing can be an ongoing endeavor. What AI creators can do instead is to focus on </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fother-blogs%2Fexecutive-perspectives%2Fwhy-ai-innovation-must-reflect-our-values-in-its-infancy%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">reflecting values in their models’ infancy</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Algorithms’ results are only as strong as the data on which they were trained. If a model is trained on a population of data disproportionate to the population it’s trying to evaluate, those inherent biases will show up once the model is live. However robust a model is, it will still lack the basic human understanding of what is right vs. wrong. And it likely cannot know if a user is leveraging it with nefarious intent in mind. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While creators can certainly make changes after building their models, the best course of action is to focus on engraining the values the AI should exhibit from day one. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Any algorithm needs vast quantities of training data to develop. In cases where the model will evaluate real-life people for anti-fraud measures, for example, it will likely need to be trained on real-world information. How do organizations ensure the data they use isn’t at risk of being stolen?

The first is to always make a cookies selection when browsing online. Now that the GDPA and CCPA are in effect, just about every company doing business in the U.S. or EU must place a warning sign on their website that it collects browsing information. Checking those preferences is a good way to keep companies from using information when you don’t want them to.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The second is to leverage third-party tools like </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, which provides services like VPNs, privacy and identity protection as part of a comprehensive security platform.

The same goes for your online accounts. Think of your login and passwords as the keys to the cozy home of your date of birth, Social Security Number, full name, and address.

The first is through a phishing attempt that asks specifically for usernames and passwords. They may impersonate a person or organization with authority, such as your boss, a bank representative, or the IRS. Phishing attempts often threaten dire consequences if you don’t reply promptly. Handle emails, texts, and social media direct messages that demand urgency with care. If it’s truly important, your bank will find another way to get in touch with you. Additionally, be aware of your notification preferences and communication channels with important organizations.

It’s a prime example of the perils that can follow when people reuse passwords. A stolen password from one account can get “stuffed” into another and give the hacker access.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Complicating the attack, and widening its scope immensely, is the DNA Relatives feature mentioned above. Because of the way it shares information between users, one compromised account can divulge the personal and genetic information of many more users – even if their account and password were not compromised in the attack. In this way, a relative handful of compromised accounts affected some 6.9 users.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What steps has 23andMe taken to protect its users?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Per the company’s statement on its blog, “If we learn that a customer’s data has been accessed without their authorization, we will notify them directly with more information.” Moreover, the company said,</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">&#8220;Our investigation continues and we have engaged the assistance of third-party forensic experts.

But if I had to pick the most important piece it is this – the absolute best way to keep your kids safe online is to commit to understanding your kids’ online world, particularly when they are starting out on their digital journey. So, if they are on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok then you need to sign up, and spend time understanding how it works. If they love Minecraft, Fortnite or Among Us – then you now do too!

To be honest, it really grinds my gears!! So, isn’t it logical that our teens would feel the same? I honestly don’t think we can expect them to take advice from us about online safety if we have no lived experience. In my opinion, experience = credibility. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, when you join Snapchat or Instagram not only are you learning about your child’s digital life but you’re also developing credibility which may just be the most important ingredient in keeping your kids safe online.

To me, it’s quite simple. Whatever platform your kids spend the bulk of their time online then that’s where you need to spend your time too. You’ll develop credibility which means they are more likely to come to you if they have an issue online. It also gives you an opportunity to model health digital habits which can be really powerful. So, if your kids use Snapchat then yes – you need to join!!! All the ‘know-how’ you amass while using it will absolutely help make you a great digital parent. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Till next time</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/do-i-really-need-to-be-on-snapchat-to-be-a-good-digital-parent/\">Do I Really Need to be on Snapchat to be a Good Digital Parent?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Is That Delivery Text Real or Fake?

Think of it this way, that’s $38 billion worth of stuff coursing through the mail and delivery services. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) alone will deliver an estimated 800 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">ii</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.

We’ve been talking a lot about that in our blogs this year, and with good reason. Scammers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">now have AI-driven tools that help them fire up fake emails, malicious sites, and text messages with a few clicks. In fact, a new phishing site is created every </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">11 seconds</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, and Americans receive an average of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">12 fake messages or scams daily</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><sup>iii</sup></span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As a result, 31% of people we surveyed said that it’s getting tougher to tell a real message from a fake one.

All in the hope that their victims will tap that malicious link. Here’s how they try to disguise themselves:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They pose as large, legitimate organizations. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the U.S., the “big four” organizations that scammers like to impersonate are the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), FedEx, UPS, and Amazon. With that, they can cast a rather wide net because they’re responsible for so many deliveries this time of year. Of course, scammers won’t limit themselves to posing as those organizations. Just about any company will do.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They do their best to make their links look legitimate too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Companies typically have a standard set of web addresses and phone numbers that they use for contacting customers. For example, Amazon states that legitimate Amazon addresses have a dot before &#8220;amazon.com&#8221; such as </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fpay.amazon.com.mcas.ms%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">https://pay.amazon.com</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> for Amazon Pay. Scammers try to spoof these addresses, often with addresses that look like the real thing but aren’t. They might use “fed-exdeliverynotices.com” rather than the legitimate fedex.com. In other cases, scammers might use a totally unrelated dot-com address, like in this phony DHL delivery notice below:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-178328 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-scam-message.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"709\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-scam-message.png 457w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-scam-message-193x300.png 193w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-scam-message-83x129.png 83w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" /></center>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Note how the scammer slipped in “dhl” after the dot-com address, all in a ruse to make the link look more legitimate by using the DHL name, a legitimate shipping company.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They use urgency to get you to act.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers rely on stress and high emotions to lure in their victims.

This method often involves social engineering tactics, exploiting psychological factors to manipulate victims into compromising actions that can have profound consequences for personal and organizational security.</p>\n<p>Over the last four months, McAfee Labs has observed a rising trend in the utilization of PDF documents for conducting a succession of phishing campaigns. These PDFs were delivered as email attachments.</p>\n<p>Attackers favor using PDFs for phishing due to the file format&#8217;s widespread trustworthiness. PDFs, commonly seen as legitimate documents, provide a versatile platform for embedding malicious links, content, or exploits. By leveraging social engineering and exploiting the familiarity users have with PDF attachments, attackers increase the likelihood of successful phishing campaigns. Additionally, PDFs offer a means to bypass email filters that may focus on detecting threats in other file formats.</p>\n<p>The observed phishing campaigns using PDFs were diverse, abusing various brands such as Amazon and Apple. Attackers often impersonate well-known and trusted entities, increasing the chances of luring users into interacting with the malicious content. Additionally, we will delve into distinct types of URLs utilized by attackers.

This strategic approach allows them to bypass traditional protection measures, as the use of LinkedIn as a referrer adds an element of legitimacy, making it more challenging for security systems to detect and block malicious activity.</p>\n<p>In addition to exploiting LinkedIn, attackers are leveraging the functionality of Google Apps Script to redirect users to phishing pages. Google Apps Script serves as a JavaScript-based development platform used for creating web applications and various other functionalities. Attackers embed malicious or phishing code within this platform, and when victims access the associated URLs, it triggers the display of phishing or malicious pages.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-178276 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1255\" height=\"736\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8.jpg 1255w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8-768x450.jpg 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Figure8-205x120.jpg 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1255px) 100vw, 1255px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 8 – Amazon fake page displayed on accessing Google script URL</em></p>\n<p>As shown in Figure 8, when victims click on the &#8220;Continue&#8221; button, they are subsequently redirected to a phishing website.</p>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Crafting highly convincing PDFs mimicking legitimate companies has become effortlessly achievable for attackers. These meticulously engineered PDFs create a sense of urgency through skillful social engineering, prompting unsuspecting customers to click on embedded phishing links. Upon taking the bait, individuals are redirected to deceptive phishing websites, where attackers request sensitive information. This sophisticated tactic is deployed on a global scale, with these convincing PDFs distributed to thousands of customers worldwide. Specifically, we highlighted the increasing use of PDFs in phishing campaigns over the past four months, with attackers adopting diverse themes such as Amazon and Apple to exploit user trust. Notably, phishing tactics extend to popular platforms like LinkedIn, where attackers leverage smart links to redirect victims to phishing pages, evading traditional security measures. Additionally, Google Apps Script is exploited for its JavaScript-based functionality, allowing attackers to embed malicious code and direct users to deceptive websites.</p>\n<h2><strong>Remediation</strong></h2>\n<p>Protecting oneself from phishing requires a combination of awareness, caution, and security practices. Here are some key steps to help safeguard against phishing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be Skeptical: Exercise caution when receiving unsolicited emails, messages, or social media requests, especially those with urgent or alarming content.</li>\n<li>Verify Sender Identity: Before clicking on any links or providing information, verify the legitimacy of the sender. Check email addresses, domain names, and contact details for any inconsistencies.</li>\n<li>Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links: Hover over links to preview the actual URL before clicking. Be wary of shortened URLs, and if in doubt, verify the link&#8217;s authenticity directly with the sender or through official channels.</li>\n<li>Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>McAfee provides coverage against a broad spectrum of active phishing campaigns, offering protection through features such as real-time scanning and URL filtering. While it enhances security against various phishing attempts, users must remain vigilant and adopt responsible online practices along with using McAfee.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/pdf-phishing-beyond-the-bait/\">PDF Phishing: Beyond the Bait</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How To Help Your Teens Stay Safe When They Start Dating Online","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-help-your-teens-stay-safe-when-they-start-dating-online/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 15:09:33 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=178136"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_120123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_120123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/300x200_Blog_120123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>In the 80’s, train stations and church groups were the key places to meet boys.

But one thing definitely hasn’t changed – parents are still worrying!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are All Teens Meeting Partners Online?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Despite what we may think, school is still the main place teens find their romantic partners according to a fascinating research study entitled: </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.mcas.ms%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC8881290%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892%23%3A~%3Atext%3DA%2520recent%2520national%2520study%2520of%2Cet%2520al.%252C%25202015).&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">‘Adolescents’ Partner Search in the Digital Age: Correlates and Characteristics of Relationships Initiated Online’</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

According to the research, girls who find it harder to fit in at school were more likely to initiate and find romantic relationships online rather than pursue them in person. This was the same for teens looking to pursue same-sex relationships. Overall, there were multiple examples of how the internet has become a ‘social intermediary’ for teens who may struggle with in-person social connection.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Should I Be Worried?

Some of us navigate these with ease while others don’t. In my opinion, a teen’s ability to think critically, pick up social cues and manage conflict will have a direct impact on their ability to navigate their online life and that includes online dating.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, yes there are risks – your teen may experience harassment, discrimination, sextortion, scams or cyberstalking. And of course, these are big heavy possibilities that no-one wants their child to experience. But you have to remember that for our kids, meeting someone online is just as normal as it was for my friends and I to meet boys at the local train station. In fact, it may even be less overwhelming as they can ‘google’ potential love matches and find friends of friends who can vouch for them or warn them away.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Instead of being worried, focus on helping your teen have a positive and safe online dating experience.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How To Set Your Teens Up For Success</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s completely natural to be hesitant about your teen dating online – I’ve been there!

Or, relay stories and experiences from your friends and their kids? Always reserve judgment and stay calm and neutral. Why not help them work out what they want by asking open and non-judgemental questions e.g. Is it a committed relationship or just a ‘fling’? This may help them work out the best platform and also manage their expectations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

So, ‘ripping off the bandaid’ and helping your teens with their online dating strategy is a great way to set them up for a safe and positive experience. We all know from experience that the path to true love isn’t always linear, so there might be a few heartbreaks or dramas along the way. So, remind your teen that you are always available to listen to their concerns and help them troubleshoot a situation. Remember, the more you keep the lines of communication open, the more likely they will be to come to you if there is an issue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Happy digital parenting!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex x</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-help-your-teens-stay-safe-when-they-start-dating-online/\">How To Help Your Teens Stay Safe When They Start Dating Online</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Look Out for the Cyber Grinch!

In fact, you’ll find evidence of an entire host of grinches online — the cybercrooks who, with the help of AI, create millions of online scams that crop up just in time to spoil the holiday season.

After all, where shoppers go, scammers follow. Research from our McAfee Labs team found that scam volume ramps up 30% above average this time of year, kicking off in November and carrying over into the first week of the new year.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">To gain even more insight into the impact online scams have on consumers, we conducted our </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">inaugural Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study.

Scammers will pop up bogus online ads and stores for sought-after gifts, of course with no intention of shipping you anything. Look out for offers that seem priced too low and hard-to-find items that are miraculously in stock at an online store you’ve never heard of. Stick with reputable retailers instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Go unlisted.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Scammers have to get your contact info from somewhere. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Often</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they get it from online data brokers and other “people finder” sites.

It follows an intricate infection chain, utilizing PowerShell commands. Key steps include changing the directory to the user&#8217;s AppData, setting variables, downloading files, and eventually executing &#8216;client32.exe&#8217;. This executable establishes control over the compromised system and registers for auto-startup through Windows Registry, following which the &#8216;client32.exe&#8217; binary is placed in the <em>&#8216;MsEdgeSandbox&#8217;</em> folder under AppData, providing persistence.</p>\n<p>The JS code looks like as shown in the picture below.

Like Variant 1, it starts with obfuscated but different JavaScript files and subsequently invokes PowerShell. However, what sets Variant 2 apart is its distinct approach to manipulating files and content. It downloads a text file from a website, decodes base64-encoded data, and creates a ZIP file with potentially malicious content. Variant 2 differs significantly when it comes to file manipulation. Instead of placing the &#8216;client32.exe&#8217; in the &#8216;MsEdgeSandbox&#8217; folder like Variant 1, it follows an alternative path. In this case, it establishes the &#8216;client32.exe&#8217; in a folder labeled <em>&#8216;D&#8217;</em> under AppData. This distinct approach to file placement sets it apart from Variant 1, despite the shared initial infection chain.</p>\n<p>The JS file as shown in Figure 12, includes two variables, &#8216;F4f&#8217; and &#8216;EQGMUD.&#8217; &#8216;F4f&#8217; is set to a specific value, 140743580. &#8216;EQGMUD&#8217; is a bit more complex; it&#8217;s a string formed by converting numerical values into characters. These values are derived by subtracting &#8216;F4f&#8217; (140743580) from them. Finally, the &#8216;eval&#8217; function is used to run the code stored in &#8216;EQGMUD&#8217; as JavaScript, essentially executing this string as a script.</p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177308 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"673\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture12.png 673w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture12-300x181.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture12-205x124.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 12 : Encoded Java Script File</p>\n<p>The AMSI buffer dumps as shown in Figure 13, contains PowerShell commands that perform several actions, including downloading a file from the internet, extracting it, and making changes to the windows registry.</p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177322 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"637\" height=\"112\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture13.png 637w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture13-300x53.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture13-205x36.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 13 : AMSI Dump</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hxxps://svirtual[.]sanviatorperu[.]edu[.]pe/readme[.]txt, this is a text file hosted on a website.

You’re getting on well and are so pumped that someone likes you for you. But then she asks for a nude pic of you, including your face. You’re unsure what to do but don’t want to lose the vibe with this great girl. So, you send it. But there’s a big problem.

Australian Federal Police Commander Hilda Sirec said that data showed more than 90% of victims were male and aged predominantly between 15 and 17 years of age. Police have seen victims as young as 10 years old.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Does It Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sextortion or sexual extortion is a form of blackmail where someone threatens to share a nude or sexual image of yourself unless you meet their demands. Often the victim is tricked or coerced into sending the images. Offenders may demand money, more images or in-person sexual favours. Sexual images may also be captured while a young person is on live stream or video. This is known as ‘capping’.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At the risk of stating the obvious, this can be an incredibly stressful process for the victim. Many offenders have mastered the art of manipulation and can make the victim feel like there is no way out of the situation. The constant threat of sharing content with family and friends coupled with the relentless demands can understandably, send many young people into a mental health tailspin. The shame and embarrassment are all consuming. Many victims feel like they have done something wrong and will be punished by parents and/or prosecuted by police if anyone finds out.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A Global Phenomena</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The sextortion trend is not isolated to Australia.

So, why not take the time to ensure your teens have the privacy settings on all their social media accounts set to ‘friends only’ or ‘private’? That way, they can’t be contacted by anyone they don’t know. Also, remind your kids that friends they meet online can’t be trusted like real ‘in-person’ friends so no sharing of personal information. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And keep the communication open and regular. If your kids know you are genuinely interested in all aspects of their life – both online and offline – and that you have their back, then they are far more likely to come to you if and when there is a problem.

Nearly three-quarters of children have experienced at least one type of cyberthreat. Inappropriate ads, images, content, and phishing attempts find children even when they’re not attempting to dodge parental controls. For parents, the thrust of International Children’s Day is an ongoing adventure, wherein they often struggle to provide the safe online learning environment their children need to thrive. To celebrate this year’s day of awareness, we&#8217;re sharing six tips for ensuring a more private and safe digital life for kids.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Encourage children to talk about their encounters with you</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">According to GCF data, 83% of children claimed they would alert their parents if they experienced an online threat. Yet only four in 10 parents surveyed said their child had ever expressed concerns to them about inappropriate content. If parents want to make their child’s internet time safer, they can focus on </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Ffamily-safety%2F8-signs-it-may-be-time-for-parental-controls%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">making conversations about online content comfortable</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. When parents know their children are experiencing threats online, they will be better equipped to do something about those threats.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember, sometimes children can be exposed to traumatic content even if they follow your guidelines and go online with parental controls. Here are some </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fdigital-strategies-to-safeguard-your-child-from-upsetting-and-violent-content-online%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">additional tips</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for talking to your child about some of the content they may see online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. If you see something, say something</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On plenty of occasions, online threats children experience likely do not require the involvement of law enforcement or similar entity. When online threats involve malicious or solicitous content, it can warrant reporting the incident. Most parents (56%) tend to simply delete content rather than report said content to the police (41%) or inform schools, when appropriate (34%). If parents want transparency from their children, they may consider practicing a bit more transparency themselves, especially when it comes to encounters that may represent criminal acts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Limit screen time altogether</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">More than 80% of children go online daily, and 36% spend 3-5 hours online in a normal day. In the digital age that has seen a large uptick in digital learning, it’s tough to keep kids away from screens. But the easiest way to ensure kids remain safe from online threats is to limit their screen time altogether. That’s an easier-said-than-done task to be sure. If parents can find ways to decrease the amount of daily time kids spend behind screens, it will reduce the amount of time they’re available to be targeted by bad actors or inappropriate content. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Demonstrate social media security</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social media, one of the most popular online activities, is a popular way for younger generations to interact with one another. Built-in messaging on social media apps gives kids a place to message each other that’s one layer removed from text messages that parents may see. Social media has also made inappropriate content </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmatters.org.mcas.ms%2Fissues%2Finappropriate-content%2Flearn-about-it%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">more accessible</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and gives hackers and other bad actors anonymity. Given that 36% of kids report coming across inappropriate images or content, and nearly 20% encounter hacking or phishing attempts when online, it’s not surprising that </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org.mcas.ms%2Fshort-reads%2F2022%2F12%2F15%2Fexplicit-content-time-wasting-are-key-social-media-worries-for-parents-of-u-s-teens%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">parents are worried</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> about the social media content their children consume. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Parents can educate their children about </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fhow-to-protect-your-social-media-accounts%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">more secure social media behavior</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Creating awareness of potential scams in their children starts with strong passwords, locked accounts, and reminding them not to click on links from or interact with accounts of people they don’t know. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5. Enable parental controls</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This may seem like an obvious safeguard against disturbing online content, but not every app, browser or device’s parental controls settings are obvious. Some portals to the internet have more granular settings and others are a bit higher-level, so creating a hermetic seal around kids’ environment can be challenging depending on how they get online and what they access when they get there. Devices like iPhones and major internet companies like Google and YouTube have pretty robust parental control settings to block mature content or remotely limit screen time. Some social media apps also have controls parents can adjust to reduce the likelihood strangers find their child’s account. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><strong> 6. </strong><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>I</strong>nstall software like browser plugins and/or VPNs</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Most browsers offer a library of plugins that allow parents to cast a web around potentially harmful content. Ad blockers can keep ads with mature content off of websites, and parental-control plugins can establish browsing controls so that kids can’t even navigate to places inappropriate content is more likely to be. Some plugins block website URLs or entire domains, rendering those destinations unnavigable. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are also many affordable </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fvpn.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8e448d8d4b51ea4216655029f629b708956e4f7b4b5603652931b52c3e1e1f22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">VPNs on the market for parents</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Parents don’t need to wait for the calendar to turn to November to create a safer digital world for their families.

We reached out to nearly 250 HR pros who are knowledgeable about </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">benefits, data privacy, and cybersecurity in organizations of 1,000 employees or more. Across the board, they said digital wellness plays an important role in their organization for several reasons. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Collectively, they said it’s effective or highly effective at enhancing security (94%), retaining employees (87%), and improving employee safety and wellbeing (86%).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Moreover, 96% of them say that digital wellness in the workplace is more important than ever. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177000\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2.png 706w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2-300x187.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2-205x127.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With that, we also gained a sense as to deeply rooted remote and hybrid work have become. We found that 71% of organizations have at least a quarter of their workforce working remotely at least some of the time. Given that <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-why-employees-place-a-high-value-on-digital-wellness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1 in 2 employees worldwide use at least one personal device for work</a>, it makes sense that HR pros have prioritized digital wellness in their organizations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet what does a digital wellness benefit entail?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Building out a strong digital wellness benefit.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As shared in our earlier article, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-the-case-for-digital-wellness-in-the-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we found little consistency between digital wellness offerings</a>. The most common initiative HR pros employ is offering antivirus software, yet even that was reported by only 60% of organizations. The list breaks down as follows from there:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177016\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3.png 586w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-271x300.png 271w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-116x129.png 116w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">One item on this list particularly stands out. Note how educating employees about phishing scams ranks so low, at 48%. Compare that to the 61% of HR pros who said that human error, such as falling victim to a phishing attack, led to a cybersecurity breach. From there, more than half said that breach led to a financial loss. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, which of the above provides the underpinnings of a strong digital wellness benefit? The answer to that is “yes to all.” And more.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When it comes to digital wellness, it’s easy to think of things like antivirus, a VPN, and other technology-driven solutions. Certainly, it’s that. Yet it’s much more. A strong digital wellness offering protects more than devices and things. It protects people. Because people are human, and human error can lead to security issues.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Organizations have IT teams tasked with securing networks, data, and devices. They put protections and policies in place to protect technology. To some extent, they factor in the human element as well. Yet to fully factor in the human element, that calls for HR to partner with IT. Together they can build out a digital wellness benefit that complements the protections IT puts in place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Building out a strong digital wellness benefit.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Organizations can often roll out digital wellness initiatives at relatively low cost, yet they require support to get them started. That begins by making the case for digital wellness benefits with leadership. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Throughout this series of articles, we uncovered how the post-pandemic world has transformed the way employees use the internet, the importance they place on digital wellness, and the reasons they welcome it as a benefit. We also pointed out that digital wellness finds itself as a top-three benefit in the wake of this new internet usage. Together, these articles can help you make the overarching case to leadership</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">illustrating that digital wellness is vital not only for organizational security, but for attracting and retaining talent as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, working alongside IT can help you make the specific case for your organization, as part of a three-step approach:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Moreover, they’ll have a sense of which employee security issues are the most pressing. By forming these insights into a list, HR can prioritize initiatives. Then it can use its expertise in incentives, training, and communication to create a culture that minimizes security lapses.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">IT can assist HR in other ways, such as with auditing. HR teams can gain insight into the number of personal devices used in the organization. With that, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">we </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">can advocate for initiatives that can protect them while they use those devices, such as offering online protection software.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2.

And should they become a victim of identity theft, they have a licensed identity restoration expert who can help them resolve it</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">and reimburse funds stolen per their protection plan.

These topics could be about enhancing their privacy, staying fit with activities like Pilates or yoga, or even finding new people to talk to. So, companies create mobile applications to make it more convenient for users and advertise these apps on their websites. But is it safe to download these advertised applications through website searches?</p>\n<p>McAfee Mobile Research Team recently observed a malicious Android and iOS information stealer application delivered via phishing sites. This malware became active in early October and has been observed installed on more than 200 devices, according to McAfee&#8217;s telemetry. All of these devices are located in South Korea. Considering that all the distribution phishing sites are active at the time of writing this blog post, it is expected that the number of affected devices will continue to increase.</p>\n<p>The malware author selects a service that people might find interesting and attracts victims by disguising their service. They also create phishing sites that use the resources of legitimate sites, making them appear identical and tricking users into thinking that they are the official website of the application they want to install. The phishing site also provides Android and iOS versions of the malicious application. When users eventually download and run the app through this phishing site, their contact information and SMS messages are sent to the malware author. McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/SpyAgent.

After we found this malware and confirmed that it was targeting South Korea, we suspected it was also distributed through a phishing campaign. So we researched several communities in Korea. One of them, called Arca Live, we were able to confirm their exact distribution method.</p>\n<p>They initially approach victims via SMS message. At this stage, the scammers pretend to be women and send seductive messages with photos. After a bit of conversation, they try to move the stage to LINE messenger. After moving to LINE Messenger, the scammer becomes more aggressive. They send victims a link to make a video call and said that it should only be done using an app that prevents capture. That link is a phishing site where malicious apps will be downloaded.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-176339\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-251x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-251x300.png 251w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-857x1024.png 857w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-768x918.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-1285x1536.png 1285w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-1713x2048.png 1713w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-108x129.png 108w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1.png 1872w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-176353\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-155x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-155x300.png 155w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-528x1024.png 528w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-768x1489.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-792x1536.png 792w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-67x129.png 67w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2.png 990w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>Figure 1.

The store shares enterprise certificates, making it easy for developers or crackers who want to use the store to share their apps with users.

Sensitive data stolen by malware (iOS)</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br />\n</strong>The focus of this ongoing campaign is targeting South Korea and there are 10 phishing sites discovered so far. This campaign can potentially be used for other malicious purposes since it steals the victim&#8217;s phone number, associated contacts, and SMS messages. So, users should consider all potential threats related to this, as the data targeted by the malware author is clear, and changes can be made to the known aspects so far.</p>\n<p>Users should remain cautious, even if they believe they are on an official website. If the app installation does not occur through Google Play Store or Apple App Store, suspicion is warranted. Furthermore, users should always verify when the app requests permissions that seem unrelated to its intended purpose. Because it is difficult for users to actively deal with all these threats, we strongly recommend that users should install security software on their devices and always keep up to date. By using McAfee Mobile Security products, users can further safeguard their devices and mitigate the risks linked with these kinds of malware, providing a safer and more secure experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</strong></p>\n<table width=\"601\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">Indicators</td>\n<td width=\"70\">Indicator Type</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://jinyoga[.]shop/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://mysecret-album[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://pilatesyoaa[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://sweetchat19[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://sweetchat23[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://telegraming[.]pro/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://dl.yoga-jin[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://aromyoga[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://swim-talk[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://spykorea[.]shop/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Phishing site</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://api.sweetchat23[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">C2 server</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">hxxps://somaonvip[.]com/</td>\n<td width=\"70\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"80\">C2 server</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">ed0166fad985d252ae9c92377d6a85025e9b49cafdc06d652107e55dd137f3b2</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Android APK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">2b62d3c5f552d32265aa4fb87392292474a1c3cd7f7c10fa24fb5d486f9f7665</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Android APK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">4bc1b594f4e6702088cbfd035c4331a52ff22b48295a1dd130b0c0a6d41636c9</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Android APK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">bb614273d75b1709e62ce764d026c287aad1fdb1b5c35d18b45324c32e666e19</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">Android APK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">97856de8b869999bf7a2d08910721b3508294521bc5766a9dd28d91f479eeb2e</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">iOS IPA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">fcad6f5c29913c6ab84b0bc48c98a0b91a199ba29cbfc5becced105bb9acefd6</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">iOS IPA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">04721303e090160c92625c7f2504115559a124c6deb358f30ae1f43499b6ba3b</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">iOS Mach-O Binary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"451\">5ccd397ee38db0f7013c52f68a4f7d6a279e95bb611c71e3e2bd9b769c5a700c</td>\n<td width=\"70\">SHA256</td>\n<td width=\"80\">iOS Mach-O Binary</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/fake-android-and-ios-apps-steal-sms-and-contacts-in-south-korea/\">Fake Android and iOS apps steal SMS and contacts in South Korea</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Scam Texts Are More Painful Than Getting a Root Canal","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/scam-texts-are-more-painful-than-getting-a-root-canal/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Amy Bunn"},"pubDate":"Wed, 08 Nov 2023 17:44:54 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=176225"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_Scam-Study.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_Scam-Study.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_Scam-Study-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Sick and tired of scam messages?

And sadly, that’s partly ruined people’s time online. They spend a </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">part</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of each day trying to decide if what they’re reading is real or fake. However, you can take a few straightforward steps that can spare you the pain </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">—</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and without having a root canal instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to protect yourself from scam messages.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Think before you click.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercriminals use phishing emails or fake sites to lure people into clicking links that </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> lead to malware. If you receive an email or text message asking you to click on a link, it’s best to avoid interacting with the message altogether. Particularly if it’s a great-sounding deal or promises useful </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">info</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Always go direct to the source and interact with reputable companies.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Many scams are effective because the scammer creates a false sense of urgency or preys on a heightened emotional state. Pause before you rush to interact with any message that is threatening or urgent, especially if it is from an unknown or unlikely sender.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Go “unlisted.”</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Scammers have to get your contact info from somewhere. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Often</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they get it from online data brokers and other “people finder” sites.

Worldwide, 80% or more of employees said that online protection was important or very important to them.

Nearly </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">seven</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> hours a day on average. What’s more, they’re spending more time doing more important things. They’re managing their finances, doing their shopping, tracking their health, and even visiting their doctors online. And at historically high rates that only continue to climb.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet with that increased activity has come increased risk. Our research found that 27% of employees worldwide said they were a victim of cybercrime. A mix of data theft, malware, phishing, and targeted spearphishing attacks led the way. Strikingly, more than half of employees in the U.S. reported the theft of sensitive </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">info</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (54%).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Of note for organizations, our research found that 1 in 2 employees use one or more personal devices for work as well. Most often that was an Android (60%) or Windows (55%) device. iOS devices featured prominently as well at 33%.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This makes a strong case for offering comprehensive online protection as part of a digital wellness program. Employers gain the confidence that their employees are protected regardless of which device they use. Employees gain the protection they want, and need, to stay safe online in the workplace and across their daily lives. Both benefit.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Everyone benefits from online protection.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just as organizations have protection measures in place to protect employees on business devices, comprehensive online protection does the same for their personal devices.

That puts it in close association with other core benefits. In India, Brazil, and Australia, online protection is closely </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">linked</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with healthcare and paid leave.

Online protection can reduce those risks significantly. It helps prevent cyberattacks that can rob employees of their time and money as they attempt to recover from an attack. And it provides a clear path forward with restorative measures in the event of a data breach or identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Aside from offering a benefit that employees highly value, organizations can realize benefits of their own when they offer comprehensive online protection. They’ll have employees who’re unburdened and undistracted from disruptive attacks. Moreover, they’ll extend protections to personal devices that their employees use. Devices that half of them use for work and personal purposes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In our next article, we’ll help you make the business case for online protection and digital wellness programs from an organizational standpoint.

This intricate chain leverages diverse file types and obfuscation methods to avoid detection, ultimately resulting in the attackers gaining remote control and successfully stealing data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Indicator of Compromise (IOCs)</strong></h2>\n<table width=\"588\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\"><strong>File</strong></td>\n<td width=\"495\"><strong>SHA256/URL</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">HTML</td>\n<td width=\"495\">83c96c9853245a32042e45995ffa41393eeb9891e80ebcfb09de8fae8b5055a3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">ISO</td>\n<td width=\"495\">97f91122e541b38492ca2a7c781bb9f6b0a2e98e5b048ec291d98c273a6c3d62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">WSF</td>\n<td width=\"495\">ac6c6e196c9245cefbed223a3b02d16dd806523bba4e74ab1bcf55813cc5702a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">PS1</td>\n<td width=\"495\">0159bd243221ef7c5f392bb43643a5f73660c03dc2f74e8ba50e4aaed6c6f531</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">PS1</td>\n<td width=\"495\">f123c1df7d17d51115950734309644e05f3a74a5565c822f17c1ca22d62c3d99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">PS1</td>\n<td width=\"495\">19402c43b620b96c53b03b5bcfeaa0e645f0eff0bc6e9d1c78747fafbbaf1807</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">VBS</td>\n<td width=\"495\">34cb840b44befdd236610f103ec1d0f914528f1f256d9ab375ad43ee2887d8ce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">BAT</td>\n<td width=\"495\">1c3d5dea254506c5f7c714c0b05f6e2241a25373225a6a77929e4607eb934d08</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"93\">PS1</td>\n<td width=\"495\">83b29151a192f868362c0ecffe5c5fabe280c8baac335c79e8950fdd439e69ac</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"93\">URL</td>\n<td width=\"495\">hxxp://45.12.253[.]107:222/f[.]txt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"495\">hxxp://45.12.253[.]107:222/j[.]jpg</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/unmasking-asyncrat-new-infection-chain/\">Unmasking AsyncRAT New Infection Chain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Benefits of Protection – The Case for Digital Wellness in the Workplace","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-the-case-for-digital-wellness-in-the-workplace/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:07:13 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175923"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_110223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_110223.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_110223-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>This is the first in a series of three articles covering digital wellness programs in the workplace.

Here we take a broad look at today’s online trends — and reveal why digital wellness is now just as vital as physical, mental, and financial wellness programs.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What once got done in person, now gets done online. And at historic levels.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">There’s no question that the pandemic transformed face-to-face interactions into face-to-screen interactions. Not to mention that it ushered in the advent of remote work on a massive scale. Yet even with the pandemic behind us and people largely returning to their places of work, that transformation remains squarely in place. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Today, we conduct more of our lives online than ever before. That makes protecting life online more important than ever before. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet in a time of data breaches, identity theft, and online scams of all stripes, online protection can seem complicated. That’s why employees welcome digital wellness as a benefit. It can help them fix weak spots in their security, protect their privacy, and put them in control of their personal data. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Simply put, employees welcome the help.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our research with Statista found that 54% of employees worldwide said that online protection is an important or very important benefit. That should come as no surprise, particularly as we take care of increasingly important things online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The internet? We’re more reliant on it than ever.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What does that look like? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">First, we can look at how we bank and shop online. Projections estimate that more than 3.5 billion people worldwide will bank online by 2024, driven in large part by online-only banks</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Global </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">e-commerce</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sales continue to climb with revenues topping more than $5.7 trillion in U.S. dollars. That growth continues at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.34%</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And that’s just for starters.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Increasingly, we track our health and wellness with connected devices too — like workouts on our </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">phones</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and biometrics on wearable devices. Worldwide, people own more than a billion wearable connected devices</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Taking that a step further, we visit the doctor online now as well. The old-fashioned house call has become the modern-day Zoom call. Our recent research found that 75% of people surveyed in early 2023 said they’ve used telehealth services in the past year</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In all, we trust the internet with some of our most important tasks. We even trust our homes to it. More than 300 million households run their day with the assistance of smart devices, like smart speakers, smart appliances, and smart deadbolt locks</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, we can point to the complicat</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ed</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> factor of remote and hybrid work. Our joint research with HR.com found that 98% of organizations surveyed have at least one or more employees who work remotely. Additional research cited by </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Forbes </span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">indicates that nearly 13% of full-time employees work remotely, while more than 28% work in a hybrid model</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. As a result, work devices inevitably get used for some personal purposes</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">just as personal devices get used for some professional purposes. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That adds up to an average of nearly seven hours a day spent online</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s little wonder that so many companies continue to show growing interest in digital wellness programs. People find themselves exposed to plenty of risk as they conduct personal business and professional business across the devices they use throughout the day. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, what </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">makes up</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> digital wellness and what it offers remains loosely defined.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The advent of digital wellness in the workplace</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Where do digital wellness programs stand in the workplace today? They share much with the state of financial wellness programs about ten years ago.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At the time, financial wellness was largely unknown. Further, companies were unsure if or how it played a part underneath the umbrella of “wellbeing.” Then changes came along. People saw how financial activities and planning can have a major impact on a person’s quality of life. Today, financial wellness is just as concrete as physical and mental wellness as benefits in the workplace.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Digital wellness now finds itself in the same evolution cycle that financial wellness entered a decade ago. It’s a concrete pillar underneath “wellbeing” much for the same reasons financial wellness is. Digital wellness reduces stress from loss or the unknown and </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">enables</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> richer, safer, and happier lives.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With that, </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">today’s threats have evolved as well. While viruses and malware remain a problem, today’s bad actors are out for bigger game</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">s</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Like stealing personal and financial info for identity theft. Or grifting detailed info from data brokers who compile and sell data linked to millions of people</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">with up to thousands of entries for each person.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We’ve also seen the onset of artificial intelligence (AI) in attacks. Fraudsters have used AI as the capstone of convincing voice, image, and video scams. Hackers now generate malware code using AI tools as well. Combine that with the multitude of ways people spend their time online, it’s clear why today’s online crooks tamper with people’s data, privacy, and identity at unprecedented rates. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">HR professionals at organizations are aware of this. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Given this climate, 55% of HR professionals said they provide it as part of their organization’s core benefits offerings. Another 36% say it’s part of their organization’s voluntary benefits offerings. Yet their offerings vary greatly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our research respondents said that they have five different digital wellness initiatives on average. Yet we found little consistency between them. Only 60% of respondents provided the same initiatives. The top responses: antivirus software, personal data cleanup, protection for work devices, and instruction on digital best practices. This illustrates that digital wellness programs are indeed in those early stages of development. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What does digital wellness truly entail?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Digital wellness protects the person. This definition provides the basis for any comprehensive digital wellness offering.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">More than offering antivirus or a VPN as a benefit, digital wellness protects the </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">lives</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that employees live online. It helps prevent the things that can absolutely upend a person’s life online, like hacks, malware attacks, and online scams. And if someone falls victim to a data breach or identity theft, it provides a clear path forward with restorative measures.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">People simply want to enjoy their time online without worrying about the risks. Yet if not looked after, gaps in their digital wellness can drive huge financial and mental stresses. For example, consider how identity theft steals more than money. It steals time, robbing a victim of their focus on other parts of their home and work lives as they struggle to recover.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As such, a digital wellness program that provides preventative and restorative measures. Often with comprehensive online protection like ours as a cornerstone offering. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet we can extend the definition further. It can also entail a healthy relationship with the internet. Balancing time spent there with other aspects of life, which can help relieve stress and burnout as well. Respondents in our HR.com research found this aspect of digital wellness appealing. Nearly half said that establishing a healthy relationship with technology is a key aspect of digital wellness</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">recognizing that this requires ongoing education.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Building your digital wellness program</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Certainly, a comprehensive and successful digital wellness program protects the whole person, not just their devices. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For organizations that want to create this kind of digital wellness program, we offer up this series of articles.

Be wary of any social media post that makes you feel an extreme emotion, in this case, sadness.

Watch out for last-minute shopping scams that are targeted at people who leave their gift buying until deep in December. As with anything else, if it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Shopping scams often take the form of phishing emails where criminals impersonate a well-known merchant.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While sales often have a quick timeline, don’t let that short timeline pressure you into making an impulsive decision. Phishing emails, when you take the time to inspect them, are usually easy to spot. The logos are often blurry and the tone of the message will seem “off.” Either it will sound very formal and impersonal or it will sound very informal and seem pushy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Phony order confirmations and tracking numbers</span></b></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">During the holiday shopping season, your doorstep can be crowded with packages. Do you remember what’s in each one? Online criminals bank on the fact that you can’t quite keep track of what you’ve purchased.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Criminals try to lure people to download malware or divulge personal or account information with bogus order confirmation and delivery tracking number emails and texts. They’ll impersonate popular online retailers or postal services and claim to have information about your order if you click on their link; however, that link will redirect to a malicious site or download a malicious payload to your device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Fake account suspensions and unable-to-deliver notices</span></b></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This holiday shopping scam also dials in on people who’ve lost track of how many online orders they’ve made and the various shopping accounts in their name. Again, phishers will impersonate popular merchants and send “urgent” messages about suspending online accounts if payment isn’t received immediately. Similarly, phishers may also impersonate delivery services claiming that they’re (basically) holding your orders hostage until you pay up. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift card cracking</span></b></h3>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift cards are a standby present for the people on your list who are difficult to buy for or for people you don’t know too well but want to get them a small something. Whether the gift card is worth $5 or $500, an online scammer can steal the entire value through two techniques: a brute force attack or phishing. Known as gift card cracking, cybercriminals can take wild guesses at gift card codes and cash in the value for themselves by methodically guessing strings of numbers and letters and crossing their fingers for a match.

Just because a company advertises on social media doesn’t mean that it’s reputable. Before you click on any links to a “deal” sent to you via email or text, hover over the link to see where the URL takes you. If it’s a long URL that redirects to a website with a typo or somewhere completely different than what you’d expect, approach with caution. An “https” at the beginning of the URL doesn’t necessarily mean that the site is secure, but it’s a good indicator that it may be ok to proceed. If a deal seems too good to be true, move along. While your wallet may ache, compromising your device, identity, or online privacy isn’t worth the risk.</span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remain skeptical and do your research. </span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\">If a charity or a stranger online asking for donations touches your heart, take a break for a few hours to think about your contribution.

To avoid gift card phishing scams, do not engage with any type of correspondence that claims they can double the value of your gift card or claims that there’s a problem with it.

That’s how things go in a cryptojacking attack.</p>\n<p>Cryptomining is the utilization of computers to run processor-intensive computations to acquire cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking involves hijacking a device and using it to mine cryptocurrency for profit. It’s a form of malware that saps your device’s resources, making it run sluggish and potentially overheating it as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the hackers behind those attacks generate cryptocurrency by hijacking your device and thousands of others like it. Together they create virtual illicit networks that turn them a profit.</p>\n<p>However, you can absolutely prevent it from happening to you. That starts with a closer look at who’s behind it and how they pull it off.</p>\n<h2><strong>How cryptojacking works.</strong></h2>\n<p>What lures hackers to cryptojacking? It’s big business. Gone are the early days when practically anyone with a standard computer could participate in the cryptomining process. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/blockchain-basics-whats-blockchain-technology-and-how-might-it-change-our-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proverbial field is flooded with miners competing against each other</a> to solve the cryptographic puzzles that earn a cryptocurrency reward. Profitable miners run farms of dedicated mining rigs that cost thousands of dollars each.</p>\n<p>Visualize row after row of racks after racks stacked with mining rigs in hyper-cooled warehouses. That’s what industrialized cryptomining looks like nowadays.</p>\n<p>To put it all into perspective, <a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nber.org.mcas.ms%2Fpapers%2Fw29396%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one study estimated</a> that “(t)he top 10% of [Bitcoin] miners control 90% and just 0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50% of mining capacity.” That makes cryptomining a difficult field to break into. And that’s why some people cheat.</p>\n<p>Enter the cryptojackers. These hackers forgo the massive up-front and ongoing costs of a cryptomining farm. Instead, they build their cryptomining operations off the backs of other people by hijacking or “cryptojacking” their devices. In doing so, they leach the computing resources of others to mine their cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Cryptojackers will target just about anyone—individuals, companies, and governmental agencies. They’ll infiltrate phones, laptops, and desktops. In larger instances, they’ll go after large server farms or an organization’s cloud infrastructure. This way, they get the computing power they need. Illegally.</p>\n<p>As to how cryptojackers pull that off, they have a couple of primary options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malware-based delivery</strong>, where a victim’s device gets infected with cryptojacking code through a phishing attack or by installing an app laced with cryptomining</li>\n<li><strong>Browser-based delivery</strong>, where cryptojackers compromise a victim’s browser while they visit a site that hosts cryptomining code. Sometimes cryptojackers create malicious sites for this specific purpose. In other instances, they infect otherwise legitimate sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What can that look like in the real world? We’ve seen <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android phones harnessed for cryptomining</a> after downloading malicious apps from Google Play. Cryptojackers have created <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/96763-beware-fake-msi-afterburner-installs-cryptojacking-information-stealing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counterfeit versions of popular computer performance software</a> and infected it with cryptojacking code. We’ve also seen cryptojackers tap into the computing power of <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rapperbot-ddos-malware-adds-cryptojacking-as-new-revenue-stream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices as well</a>.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the rate of cryptojacking attacks is closely tied to the vagaries of the marketplace. As the value of cryptocurrencies rise and fall, so does cryptojacking. The crooks behind these hacks go where they get the biggest bang for their buck. So as cryptocurrencies drop in value, these crooks drop their cryptojacking attacks. They opt for other attacks that offer a higher return on the resources they invest.</p>\n<p>Despite its cyclic nature, cryptojacking remains a stubborn problem. Yet you can do plenty to prevent it from happening to you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Three ways you can prevent cryptojacking.</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stick to legitimate app stores: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure, third-party sites might very well not. Further, some third-party sites might intentionally host malicious apps as part of a broader scam.</p>\n<p>Granted, hackers have found ways to work around Google and Apple’s review process, yet the chances of downloading a safe app from them are far greater than anywhere else. Further, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps when discovered, making their stores that much safer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use online protection software:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comprehensive online protection software</a> like ours can protect you in several ways. First, our AI-powered antivirus detects, blocks, and removes malware—new and old. This can protect you against the latest cryptojacking attacks. Further, it includes web protection that blocks malicious sites, such as the ones that host web-based cryptojacking attacks. In all, comprehensive online protection software offers a strong line of defense.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protect yourself from phishing and smishing attacks:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether cryptojackers try to reach you by email (phishing) or text (smishing), our new <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/scamprotection?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee Scam Protection</a> can stop those attacks dead in their tracks. Using the power of AI, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/scamprotection?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee Scam Protection</a> can alert you when scam texts pop up on your device or phone. No more guessing if a text is real or not. Further, it can block risky sites if you accidentally follow a scam link in a text, email, social media, and more.</p>\n<h2><strong>Keep cryptojackers from making a fast buck off you.</strong></h2>\n<p>While hackers love pilfering the computing resources of large organizations, their cryptojacking attacks still target everyday folks. Just as is the case with ransomware, hackers will seek to make their money in volume. Targeting under-protected households can still reap plenty of cryptocurrency when hackers do so in numbers.</p>\n<p>Protecting yourself is relatively easy. Several of the same general steps you take to protect yourself online offer protection from cryptojacking attacks as well. Stick to legitimate app stores, use the tools that can quash spammy emails and texts, and go online confidently with online protection software. Nobody should make a fast buck off you. Particularly a cryptojacker.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cryptojacking-stop-hackers-from-making-money-off-you/\">Cryptojacking – Stop Hackers from Making Money Off You</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence and Winning the Battle Against Deepfakes and Malware","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/artificial-intelligence-and-winning-the-battle-against-deepfakes-and-malware/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jasdev Dhaliwal"},"pubDate":"Tue, 03 Oct 2023 15:00:00 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=173100"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>As AI deepfakes and malware understandably grab the headlines, one thing gets easily overlooked—AI also works on your side.

By analyzing the behavior of files for patterns that are consistent with malware behavior, it can prevent a previously unknown file or process from doing harm.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"><br />\n</span></li>\n<li><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:105,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It further detects threats by referencing known malware signatures and behaviors.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> This combats zero-day and pre-existing threats alike. AI can spot zero-day threats by comparing them to malware fingerprints and behaviors it has learned. Similarly, its previous learnings help AI quickly spot pre-existing threats in this manner as well.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n<li><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:105,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It automatically classifies threats and adds them to the body of threat intelligence. </span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI-driven threat protection gets stronger over time. The more threats it encounters, the more rapidly and readily it can determine if files are malicious or benign. Furthermore, AI automatically classifies threats at a speed and scale unmatched by traditional processes. The body of threat intelligence improves immensely as a result. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What does AI-driven protection look like for you? It can identify malicious websites before you can connect to them. It can prevent new forms of ransomware from encrypting your photos and files.

It calls for eyeballing the content you come across critically.

Advances in AI give images a clarity and crispness that they didn’t have before, deepfake videos play more smoothly, and voice cloning gets uncannily accurate.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet even with the best AI, scammers often leave their fingerprints all over the fake news content they create. Look for the following: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) Consider the context  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI fakes usually don’t appear by themselves. There’s often text or a larger article around them. Inspect the text for typos, poor grammar, and overall poor composition. Look to see if the text even makes sense. And like legitimate news articles, does it include identifying information — like date, time, and place of publication, along with the author’s name.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Evaluate the claim </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does the image seem too bizarre to be real? Too good to be true? Today, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet,” now includes “Don’t believe everything you see on the internet.” If a fake news story is claiming to be real, search for the headline elsewhere. If it’s truly noteworthy, other known and reputable sites will report on the event—and have done their own fact-checking. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3) Check for distortions </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The bulk of AI technology still renders fingers and hands poorly. It often creates eyes that might have a soulless or dead look to them — or that show irregularities between them. Also, shadows might appear in places where they look unnatural. Further, the skin tone might look uneven. In deepfaked videos, the voice and facial expressions might not exactly line up, making the subject look robotic and stiff.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI is on your side in this new era of online protection.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The battle between hackers and the people behind online protection continues. And while the introduction of AI has unleashed all manner of new attacks, the pattern prevails. Hackers and security professionals tap into the same technologies and continually up the game against each other.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Understandably, AI conjures questions, uncertainty, and, arguably, fear. Yet you can rest assured that, behind the headlines of AI threats, security professionals use AI technology for protection. For good.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet an online scam remains an online scam. Many times, it takes common sense and a sharp eye to spot a hustle when you see one. If anything, that remains one instance where humans still have a leg up on AI. Humans have gut instincts. They can sense when something looks, feels, or sounds …off. Rely on that instinct. And give yourself time to let it speak to you. In a time of AI-driven fakery, it still stands as an excellent first line of defense.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/artificial-intelligence-and-winning-the-battle-against-deepfakes-and-malware/\">Artificial Intelligence and Winning the Battle Against Deepfakes and Malware</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How much do you count on the internet every day?","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cybersecurity-awareness-month/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 15:58:15 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity awareness Month"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175226"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Maybe you do armloads of shopping on it.

Theft or loss of an unsecured mobile device can, and often does, result in a catastrophic loss of privacy and financial security.</p>\n<h2>Mobile Device Security</h2>\n<p>The unfortunate reality of our digital era is that devices are lost, misplaced, or stolen every day. A mobile device without password protection is a gold mine for anyone with malicious intent. According to a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130224005140/en/McAfee-Reveals-Consumers-Fail-to-Protect-Their-Mobile-Devces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global survey</a> by McAfee and One Poll, many consumers are largely unconcerned about the security of their personal data stored on mobile devices. To illustrate, only one in five respondents had backed up data on their tablet or smartphone. Even more concerning, 15% admitted they saved password information on their phone.</p>\n<p>Such statistics are troubling for several reasons. The most obvious is the risk of personal information —including banking details and online login credentials— falling into the wrong hands. A lost or stolen device is not just a device lost— it&#8217;s potentially an identity, a bank account, or worse. The lack of urgency in securing data on mobile devices speaks to a broad consumer misunderstanding about the severity of the threats posed by cybercriminals and the ease with which they can exploit an unprotected device.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/mcafee-2023-consumer-mobile-threat-report/\">McAfee 2023 Consumer Mobile Threat Report</a></p>\n<h2>The Gender Disparity in Mobile Device Security</h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising findings of the survey is the difference in mobile security behaviors between men and women. This difference illustrates not just a disparity in the type of personal information each group holds dear, but also the degree of risk each is willing to accept with their mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, men tend to place greater value on the content stored on their devices, such as photos, videos, and contact lists. Women, on the other hand, appear more concerned about the potential loss of access to social media accounts and personal communication tools like email. They are <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programme/connected-women/security-and-harassment-on-mobile-phones-a-growing-concern-for-women-in-emerging-markets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistically</a> more likely to experience online harassment and privacy breaches. This could explain why they are more concerned about the security of their social media accounts, as maintaining control over their online presence can be a way to protect against harassment and maintain a sense of safety.</p>\n<p>The loss of a mobile device, which for many individuals has become an extension of their social identity, can disrupt daily life significantly. This distinction illustrates that the consequences of lost or stolen mobile devices are not just financial, but social and emotional as well.</p>\n<h2>Risky Behaviors Persist</h2>\n<p>Despite the differences in what we value on our mobile devices, the survey showed a worrying level of risky behavior from both genders. Over half (55%) of respondents <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130224005140/en/McAfee-Reveals-Consumers-Fail-to-Protect-Their-Mobile-Devces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">admitted</a> sharing their passwords or PIN with others, including their children. This behavior not only leaves devices and data at risk of unauthorized access but also contributes to a wider culture of complacency around mobile security.</p>\n<p>Password protection offers a fundamental layer of security for devices, yet many people still choose convenience over safety. Setting a password or PIN isn&#8217;t a failsafe method for keeping your data safe. However, it is a simple and effective starting point in the broader effort to protect our digital lives.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/crack-the-pin/\">Put a PIN on It: Securing Your Mobile Devices</a></p>\n<h2>Steps to Mobile Device Security</h2>\n<p>While the survey results raise an alarm, the good news is that we can turn things around. It all begins with acknowledging the risks of leaving our mobile devices unprotected. There are simple steps that can be taken to ramp up the security of your devices and protect your personal information.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, password-protect all your devices. This means going beyond your mobile phone to include tablets and any other portable, internet-capable devices you may use. And, while setting a password, avoid easy ones like &#8220;1234&#8221; or &#8220;1111&#8221;. These are the first combinations a hacker will try. The more complex your password is, the sturdier a barrier it forms against unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Another important step is to avoid using the &#8220;remember me&#8221; function on your apps or mobile web browser. Although it might seem convenient to stay logged into your accounts for quick access, this considerably amplifies the risk if your device gets stolen or lost. It&#8217;s crucial to ensure you log out of your accounts whenever not in use. This includes email, social media, banking, payment apps, and any other accounts linked to sensitive information.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> If your phone is lost or stolen, employing a combination of tracking your device, locking it remotely, and erasing its data can safeguard both your phone and the information it contains.

Admittedly, this might be challenging to implement, especially with family members or close friends. But the potential harm it can prevent in the long run far outweighs the temporary convenience it might present.</p>\n<h2>Investing in Mobile Security Products</h2>\n<p>Having highlighted the importance of individual action towards secure mobile practices, it&#8217;s worth noting that investing in reliable security software can also make a world of difference. A mobile security product like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html\">McAfee Mobile Security</a>, which offers <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">anti-malware</a>, web protection, and app protection, can provide a crucial extra layer of defense.</p>\n<p>With app protection, not only are you alerted if your apps are accessing information on your mobile that they shouldn’t, but in the event that someone does unlock your device, your personal information remains safe by locking some or all of your apps. This means that even if your device falls into the wrong hands, they still won&#8217;t be able to access your crucial information.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also critical to stay educated on the latest ways to protect your mobile device. Cyber threats evolve constantly, and awareness is your first line of defense.

A common misconception is that a password only needs to be memorable. Whilst this is a helpful trait, it does a disservice to the importance of having a secure series of characters. This guide will walk you through why &#8220;123456&#8221; is not an acceptable password, dispel some common password misconceptions, and provide some tips on how to create a secure password.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Importance of Secure Passwords</h2>\n<p>Security is a necessary concern in the digital age. Every time we create an account, fill out a form, or simply browse the internet, we leave a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/digital-footprints-privacy-concerns/\">digital footprint</a> that can be traced back to us. Criminals, hackers, and other malicious parties are constantly hunting for sensitive information they can exploit. This is what makes the creation of secure passwords so vital.</p>\n<p>Think of your password as the first line of defense against potential attackers. When your passwords are weak or predictable, like &#8216;123456&#8217;, you effectively leave your front door open to criminals. While it may feel like an inconvenience to memorize complex passwords, consider the potential damage that could be done should your personal or financial information fall into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/why-passwords-matter/\">Protect Your Digital Life: Why Strong Passwords Matter</a></p>\n<h2>Why &#8216;123456&#8217; Is Not a Good Password</h2>\n<p>Some may argue that &#8216;123456&#8217; is a good password because it&#8217;s easy to remember. This is a dangerous misconception. &#8216;123456&#8217; is an extremely common password, and it&#8217;s also one of the first combinations that hackers attempt when trying to break into an account. In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/most-common-passwords-of-2022-make-sure-yours-isnt-on-the-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a>, &#8216;123456&#8217; and &#8216;password&#8217; are consistently ranked as the most commonly used passwords year after year.</p>\n<p>Another reason why &#8216;123456&#8217; is not a good password is due to its lack of complexity. Many websites and online services require passwords to include a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. This requirement is not arbitrary; it’s a method proven to increase the difficulty for hackers attempting to crack your password. Using &#8216;123456&#8217; as your password doesn&#8217;t meet these requirements, making it an easy target for a hacking attempt.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/six-easy-steps-to-help-keep-hackers-at-bay/\">Six Easy Steps to Help Keep Hackers at Bay</a></p>\n<h2>Essential Checks for a Secure Password</h2>\n<p>Ensuring that your password adheres to certain safety standards is crucial. Here are some key checks to consider when creating a password:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don&#8217;t Use a Real Word:</b> If your password contains a word that can be found in the dictionary, it&#8217;s time to change it. Using names of favorite items or pets can be easily guessed by hackers. Opt for an invented word, a blend of unique phrases or even nonsensical gibberish. The more unique, the better your security.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mix It Up:</b> Since most password systems are case-sensitive, using a mixture of upper and lower case letters can make your password more secure. Introduce numbers and symbols to make it more complex and avoid obvious choices like birthdays or the infamous &#8216;123456&#8217;.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Default is Fault:</b> All &#8220;smart&#8221; devices come with default passwords. From your latest smart home appliance to your phone, always change the provided password immediately after setup. This step, combined with regularly updating passwords, can greatly increase your protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/make-your-smart-home-a-secure-home-too-securing-your-iot-smart-home-devices/\">Make Your Smart Home a Secure Home Too: Securing Your IoT Smart Home Devices</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>One Password Doesn&#8217;t Fit All:</b> Never use the same password for multiple accounts. While it may seem difficult to remember multiple complex passwords, using a password management solution can help keep track of all your login information and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/password-generator.html\">generate unique, secure passwords</a> for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your proactive approach to password security is the bedrock of your defense against evolving <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/cybersecurity-reports-and-guides.html\">cyber threats</a>, ensuring your digital life remains safe and sound. Make sure to follow these reminders every time you create and change passwords.</p>\n<h2>Password Manager As An Option</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">Password managers</a> are specialized tools that generate, store, and autofill complex and unique passwords for various online accounts. They eliminate the need for users to remember and manually enter their passwords, and this not only simplifies the login process but significantly bolsters security. These tools employ strong encryption to safeguard your login credentials, ensuring your passwords remain inaccessible to hackers. Many password managers also offer the convenience of cross-device synchronization, allowing you to access your passwords securely on multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity threats are more sophisticated than ever, and easily guessable passwords are the first vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. So, as you aim to make your 123456 passwords more complicated, consider using a password manager to store all your passwords and help you remember them properly.</p>\n<h3>Changing Passwords: A Habit to Develop</h3>\n<p>Changing passwords frequently is a habit we all need to cultivate. Doing so regularly makes it very difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to your personal information. It&#8217;s not just about protecting your accounts, but every device that holds your precious data. This habit, though may seem cumbersome initially, will eventually act as a robust shield against potential cyber attacks. Interest in cyber security is rising, and for a good reason. With more of our lives moving online, it&#8217;s crucial to stay updated on the latest trends in mobile and digital security. Many resources are available online to help individuals stay safe in the digital world. Maintaining strong, unique passwords and changing them frequently is one of the simplest and most effective ways to safeguard against cyber threats.</p>\n<h2>How Often You Should Change Passwords</h2>\n<p>The frequency of changing passwords should be tailored to the security sensitivity of the account and the strength of the existing password. For high-security accounts, such as email or online banking, changing passwords every 60 to 90 days is advisable, while moderate-security accounts can be changed every 90 to 180 days. Low-security accounts may require less frequent changes, and immediate password updates are essential if you suspect a compromise. Strong, unique passwords reduce the necessity for frequent changes, and the use of two-factor authentication further enhances account security.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> In certain circumstances, it might become imperative to change your password without delay, particularly when a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to your account. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-often-should-you-change-your-passwords/\">Learn more about how often you should change your passwords</a></i><i>. </i></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>&#8216;123456&#8217; is not an acceptable password due to its predictability and lack of complexity. Choosing secure passwords that are complex, unique, and difficult to guess is crucial in safeguarding your online presence. Coupled with regular password changes, using a password management solution, and avoiding default device passwords, you can ensure your personal and financial information remains secure.

Here’s how they stack up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phony bank alerts and messages.</li>\n<li>Bogus gift offers that steal personal info.</li>\n<li>“Problems” with package deliveries.</li>\n<li>Job scams.</li>\n<li>Amazon imposter scams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sound familiar, like something that you’ve seen pop up on your phone? Chances are it does. In all, the scammers behind these texts want the same thing—your personal info, money, or a combination of both. They just take different routes to get there.</p>\n<p>Beyond the top five, the other 58% of scams put their spin on their texts. However, different as they are, these scam texts have several common signs you can spot.</p>\n<p>First off, they usually include a link. The link might include unusual strings of characters and a web address that doesn’t match who the message says it’s coming from. Like a bogus notice from the post office that doesn’t use the official post office URL. Or, the link might look <em>almost</em> like a legitimate address, but changes the name in a way that indicates it’s bogus.</p>\n<p>Instead of a link, the text might contain a phone number to call. Sophisticated scam operations run call centers that work much like legitimate call centers—although scammers design them to steal your money and personal info.</p>\n<p>The message might employ a scare tactic or threat. Scammers love this approach because it successfully plays on people’s emotions and gets them to act quickly without much thinking.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the text might be a seemingly innocent message. Like, “Is this Steven’s number?” Or, “I’ll always love you.” Sometimes it’s only a simple, “Hi.” This is by design. The scammer wants to pique your curiosity, or your desire to be helpful, and then respond. From there, the scammer will try to strike up a conversation, which can lead to a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/online-dating-scams-and-how-to-spot-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">romance scam</a> or a similar con game like an <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/online-job-scams-tiktokers-tell-their-stories-with-a-warning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online job scam</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to spot the top five text scams.</strong></h2>\n<p>Fortunately, scammers tend to follow a basic script. You’ll see variations, of course. Yet these texts share common elements, just as text scams in general do. That makes them easy to spot.</p>\n<p>Be on the lookout for:</p>\n<p><strong>Bank scams like, </strong>“BANK FRAUD ALERT: Did you make a $4,237.95 purchase at Jacuzzi World? Please confirm!” You’ll know if it’s a scam if the text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was sent from an institution you don’t bank with. That’s an immediate sign.</li>\n<li>Comes from an unrecognizable and unofficial number.</li>\n<li>Requests you to tap a link or call the number—likely to provide personal info.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gift scams like,</strong> “ATT FREE MESSAGE. Thanks for paying your bill. Click here for a reward.” First, you can note that the scammer spelled the phone carrier <em>AT&amp;T</em> incorrectly. Other signs of a scam include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The text involves tapping a link to claim your (bogus) prize—or calling an unknown number.</li>\n<li>It involves paying a fee for shipping your (bogus) prize.</li>\n<li>It similarly calls for submitting account or personal info to pay for your (bogus) winnings.</li>\n<li>The payout is for a lottery or giveaway you never entered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Delivery scams like,</strong> “We were unable to deliver your shipment. Please update your info so that we can get your package to you.” This is a common one, and you can spot it several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First off, you’re not expecting a package. Let alone one from the “company” that sent you the text.</li>\n<li>It contains a link that doesn’t look like it directs you to an official site, like UPS or FedEx.</li>\n<li>If you’re in North America, look at the number of the sender. Some scammers text from an overseas location. This can result in a long phone number that contains a country code with a “+” in front of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Job scams like,</strong> “BE A SECRET SHOPPER. Make $500 per store! Click the link to get started!” A company that hires employees by sending thousands of spammy texts isn’t a company at all. It’s a scam. Other signs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They ask you to tap a link or call a number, once again.</li>\n<li>The link looks like a string of nonsense or like a slightly fudged version of a legitimate web address.</li>\n<li>The job offer seems too good to be true. (Because it is.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Amazon scams like,</strong> “TRANSACTION ALERT: Your purchase of a 65” QLED TV for $1,599.99 is confirmed. Not you? Contact us to cancel the order.” This is a spin on the bank fraud alert, with the scammers posing as Amazon’s fraud team. Aside from using the Amazon name, other signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The text lists a big-ticket item with a big price tag to get your attention.</li>\n<li>There’s a sense of urgency. The text implies you need to act quickly to cancel the order.</li>\n<li>You have a number to call or a link to tap, which puts you in touch with a phony customer care rep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Now, how to avoid text scams.</strong></h2>\n<p>With what you need to spot scam texts, now you can avoid the damage they can do. And you can take additional steps to keep them from reaching you altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Don’t tap on links in text messages:</strong> If you follow one piece of advice, it’s this.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Follow up directly:</strong> If you have concerns, get in touch with the company you think might have sent it. Manually type in their website and enquire there. Again, don’t tap any links.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Clean up your personal data:</strong> Scammers must have gotten your number from somewhere, right? Often, that’s an <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-a-data-broker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online data broker</a>—a company that keeps thousands of personal records for millions of people.

A product like our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> can help you remove your info from some of the riskiest sites out there.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

I realise that it’s not perfect but in my opinion, it’s like having a personal digital assistant to help you wade through those super heavy parenting years. Imagine how helpful it would be to have your ‘assistant’ develop a personalised bedtime story for your 6-year-old or, work out what you can cook with just the ingredients in your fridge!! I am so sure I would have been a more relaxed mother if I had <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT</a> working for me!!</p>\n<p><strong>How Does </strong><strong>ChatGPT</strong><strong> Work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is an amazing website that allows you to have human-like conversations with a chatbot that is driven by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> technology. The chatbot can answer your questions, compose emails and essays, translate text, develop code and more. At the time of writing, there is a free version of ChatGPT available which gives the user unlimited access however the paid premium version of $US20 per month gives priority access during peak times, faster response speeds and exclusive access to GPT-4 – a smarter and more capable chatbot!</p>\n<p>If you’d like to know more about it, check out my <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\">Parents’ </a><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT</a><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\"> Guide</a> which will help fill in the blanks.</p>\n<p><strong>How </strong><strong>ChatGPT</strong><strong> Can Make You A Better Parent</strong></p>\n<p>There are so many ways ChatGPT can reduce the stress of parenting and give you some much-needed head space. Here are my top 5:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What’s For Dinner?</strong></p>\n<p>If I look back at the super intense parenting years when I was working full-time with 4 kids, one of the greatest causes of my stress was dinner. I often wouldn’t have the physical energy to read a recipe book or stop at the shops after an afternoon of school and extra-curricular pickups so I would be scrambling to feed a bunch of ravenous boys. Imagine how good it would be to have your digital assistant, aka ChatGPT, devise a recipe based on what you have in your fridge and pantry? Nothing short of life-changing, in my opinion. And it can even factor in dietary restrictions! So clever!!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Can You Tell Me A Bedtime Story</strong></p>\n<p>My boys loved bedtime stories – preferably personalised! I know, very demanding!! Now, with 4 separate stories to deliver every night, you can only imagine how much mental energy this required. But if I had ChatGPT working for me, this would take just seconds to solve. Simply enter the name and age of the child (no surnames), the setting, the names of other characters that should be included, and then a theme e.g. hero’s journey, determination, friendship, and wham bam – you’ve got something ready to go!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Your Next Holiday – Sorted!</strong></p>\n<p>When things are so hectic, it is often the thought of a vacation that can keep you going. However, let’s be honest, successful holidays take quite a bit of planning to get right. Well – that’s where your digital assistant can help. If you ask, ChatGPT can develop itineraries with activity suggestions. It can also recommend hotels – simply ask it for suggestions within a specific location e.g. close to the Eiffel Tower. And it can also tailor its recommendations based on your budget. After planning and managing family holidays for my clan of 6 for well over 20 years, this is a life-changing feature!</p>\n<p><strong>4. The Best Birthday Party Checklist Ever</strong></p>\n<p>Far out, birthday parties can be stressful experiences. Invitations, themes, venue, entertainment, kids’ food, lolly bags, parents’ food, parents’ drinks, the list goes on and on. But if you haven’t already put ChatGPT to work as a party planner – then you’re missing out. Simply type in the age of the child and it can give you an entire plan. It will also give you 20-25 top tips that I guarantee will ensure you have everything covered!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Homework Help </strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve got a tribe of kids who are all at various levels and need homework help, then staying up to date with maths and science can be quite exhausting – particularly after a long day at work! Simply entering ‘explain’ or ‘explain so a 10-year-old can understand’ into ChatGPT will provide you with enough smarts to get that homework done. Of course, fact-checking ChatGPT is essential but what it will provide is some momentum in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>But A Word of Caution</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> can absolutely make your life easier as a parent but there are a few things to remember before you start typing into that chat box.</p>\n<p><strong>1. It Doesn’t Always Get Everything Right</strong></p>\n<p>It’s important to double-check everything. Ensure your kids also appreciate that everything online needs to be double-checked.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Be Mindful of Your Privacy When Using It</strong></p>\n<p>For a full explanation of its impact on privacy and how you can protect yourself, check out my recent blog post about . But to summarise: be careful what you share in the chat box, stay anonymous, and consider deleting your chat history.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Consider How You Use It With Your Kids</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest negatives of ChatGPT is its potential impact on creativity and thinking skills. Some schools and universities have banned its use while others have specialised programs that supposedly can detect whether a student has used it. While it does sadden me that our kids won’t need to struggle over complex maths questions or English essays like we did, I am a realist and believe that whether we like it or not – it is here to stay. My prediction is that the school and university systems will adapt because generative AI will be a part of our kids’ world. Our role as parents and educators is to teach them how to use it safely and with a critical-thinking mindset.</p>\n<p>So, if you’ve dreamed about hiring a personal assistant (I do regularly!) then you so need to check out ChatGPT. It will help you get through your ‘to-do’ list, save you so much time and energy which means you’ve got more time to spend with your kids – or by yourself under a tree. You choose!!</p>\n<p>Till Next Time</p>\n<p>Stay Safe Online</p>\n<p>Alex</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/could-chatgpt-be-the-best-thing-thats-ever-happened-to-your-family/\">Could ChatGPT Be The Best Thing That’s Ever Happened To Your Family?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How To Talk To Your Kids About Identity Theft","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-identity-theft/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:53:40 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175052"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Let’s be honest, talking to your kids about identity theft isn’t probably top of your list.

There’s a long list of topics to cover off when you are a parent. But if you take a minute to picture someone stealing your child’s identity or using their personal information to take out a loan for a shiny new car then you’ll probably want to move it closer to the top of your parenting to-do list!</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Identity Theft?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Identity theft</a> occurs when a person’s personal identifying information is used without their permission, usually to commit fraud by making unauthorised purchases or transactions. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/5-common-types-of-identity-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Identity theft can happen in many ways</a>, but its victims are usually left with significant damage to their finances, credit score, and even their mental health.</p>\n<p>Most people associate identity theft with data breaches &#8211; think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/optus-data-breach-everything-we-know-so-far-about-what-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latitudefinancial.com.au/latitude-cyber-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Latitude Financial</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/medibank-confirms-that-every-customer-s-personal-data-was-accessed-in-hack-20221026-p5bsy7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medibank</a> &#8211; however, there are many more ways that scammers can get their hands on your personal identifying details. They can use <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘phishing’ emails</a> to get information from you, do a deep dive on your social media accounts to find identifying information in posts or photos, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/the-risks-of-public-wi-fi-and-how-to-close-the-security-gap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hack public Wi-Fi</a> to access any information you share or simply, steal your wallet or go through your trash!!</p>\n<p><strong>How Big An Issue Is It Really?</strong></p>\n<p>In short, it’s a big problem &#8211; for both individuals and organisations. And here are the statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>76,000 cybercrime reports</strong> were made in the 2021/22 financial year, an increase of nearly 13% from the previous year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report-july-2021-june-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Annual Cyber Threat Report</a> by The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC).</li>\n<li>A recent study by <a href=\"https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/sb/sb42#:~:text=Thirty%2Done%20percent%20of%20respondents,their%20bank%20statements%20or%20accounts.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Australian Cybercrime Survey</a> showed that <strong>31% of respondents had experienced identity crime in their lifetime and 20% within the previous 12 months</strong>. Just under half of the victims reported that they had noticed suspicious transactions on their bank statements. Although 25% of respondents couldn’t identify how their information was stolen, 16% attributed it to the hacking of a computer or device.</li>\n<li><strong>10 million</strong> Australians had their personal details stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-21/optus-hack-class-action-customer-privacy-breach-data-leaked/102247638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optus data breach</a> in September 2022.</li>\n<li><strong>7 million</strong> Australians also had personal data stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-01-17/medibank-hack-data-breach-complaint-explainer/101858182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medibank data breach</a> in October 2022.</li>\n<li><strong>14 million</strong> Australians had their personal information stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/28/latitude-financial-faces-possible-class-action-after-millions-affected-by-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Latitude Financial data breach</a> in March 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How Do You Know If You’re a Victim?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest issues with identity theft is that you often don’t immediately know that you’re a victim. In some cases, it might take weeks before you realise that something is awry which unfortunately, gives the thief a lot of time to wreak havoc! Some of the signs that something might be wrong include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfamiliar charges to your bank account</li>\n<li>Calls and texts about products or services that you’ve never used</li>\n<li>You’re denied credit</li>\n<li>Strange emails in your inbox</li>\n<li>Not receiving expected mail</li>\n<li>Unexpected calls or letters from debt collectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What To Do If You Think You’re a Victim</strong></p>\n<p>The key here is to act as soon as you believe you are affected. Don’t stress that there has been a delay in taking action – just take action now! Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Call Your Bank</strong></p>\n<p>Your first call should be to your bank so they can block the affected account. The aim here is to prevent the scammer from taking any more money. Also remember to block any cards that are linked to this account, either credit or debit.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Change Your Passwords</strong></p>\n<p>If your identity has been stolen then it’s highly likely that the scammer knows your passwords so change the passwords for the affected accounts straight away!! And if you have used this same password on any other accounts then change these also. If you can’t remember, you can always reset the passwords on key accounts just to be safe.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Report It</strong></p>\n<p>It may feel like a waste of time reporting your identity theft, but it is an important step, particularly as your report becomes a formal record – evidence you may need down the track. It may also prevent others from becoming victims by helping authorities identify patterns and hopefully, perpetrators.  If you think your personal identifying information has been used, report it to the Australian authorities at <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ReportCyber</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Make a Plan</strong></p>\n<p>It’s likely you’re feeling pretty overwhelmed at what to do next to limit the damage from your identity theft – and understandably so! Why not make a contract with <a href=\"https://www.idcare.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDCARE</a>? It’s a free service dedicated to assisting victims of identity theft &#8211; both individuals and organisations &#8211; in Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>How Do We Talk To Our Kids About It?</strong></p>\n<p>If there is one thing I have learned in my 20+ years of parenting, it is this. If you want to get your kids ‘onboard’ with an idea or a plan, you need to take the time to explain the ‘why’. There is absolutely no point in asking or telling them to do something without such an explanation. It is also imperative that you don’t lecture them. And the final ingredient? Some compelling statistics or research – ideally with a diagram &#8211; my boys always respond well to a visual!</p>\n<p>So, if you haven’t yet had the identity theft chat with your kids then I recommend not delaying it any further. And here’s how I’d approach it.</p>\n<p>Firstly, ensure you are familiar with the issue. If you understand everything I’ve detailed above then you’re in good shape.</p>\n<p>Secondly, arm yourself with relevant statistics. Check out the ones I have included above. Why not supplement this with a few relevant news stories that may resonate with them? This is your ‘why’.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, focus on prevention. This needs to be the key focus. But don’t badger or lecture them. Perhaps tell them what you will be doing to minimise the risk – see below for your key ‘hot tips’ – you’re welcome!</p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Do To Manage Identity Theft?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few key things that you can today that will both minimise your risk of becoming a victim and the consequences if you happen to be caught up in a large data breach.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Passwords</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Managing passwords</a> for your online accounts is one of the best risk management strategies for identity theft. I know it’s tedious, but I recommend creating a unique and complex 10+ digit password for each of your online accounts. Tricky passwords make it harder for someone to get access to your account. And, if you use the same log-in details for each of your online accounts &#8211; and your details are either leaked in a data breach or stolen &#8211; then you could be in a world of pain. So, take the time to get your passwords sorted out.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Think Before You Post</strong></p>\n<p>Sharing private information about your life on social media makes it much easier for a scammer to steal your identity. Pet names, holiday destination and even special dates can provide clues for passwords. So, lock your social media profiles down and ensure your privacy settings are on.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be Proactive &#8211; Monitor Your Identity Online</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine how good it would be if you could be alerted when your personal identifying information was found on the Dark Web? Well, this is now a reality! McAfee’s latest security offering entitled <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a> will not only protect you against threats but provide 24/7 monitoring of your personal details so it can alert you if your information is found on the Dark Web. And if your details are found, then advice and help may also be provided to remedy the situation. How good!!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Using Public Computers and Wi-Fi With Caution</strong></p>\n<p>Ensuring you always log out of a shared computer is an essential way of keeping prying eyes away from your personal identifying information. And always be super careful with public Wi-Fi. I only use it if I am desperate and I never conduct any financial transactions, ever! Cybercriminals can ‘snoop’ on public Wi-Fi to see what’s being shared, they can stage ‘Man in The Middle Attacks’ where they eavesdrop on your activity, or they can lure you to use their trustworthy sounding Wi-Fi network – designed purely to extract your private information!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Monitor Your Bank Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Why not make a habit of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regularly checking your bank accounts</a>? And if you find anything that doesn’t look right contact your bank immediately to clarify.

Let&#8217;s look at a sample exploiting this vulnerability (Hash: bc15b0264244339c002f83e639c328367efb1d7de1b3b7c483a2e2558b115eaa)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The image below shows that the archive is named trading_system, which hints that it is used to target traders</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174464 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-300x271.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-143x129.jpg 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can also see that the threat actor can craft the archive so that folder and file names are the same.</li>\n<li>This is interesting as Windows doesn&#8217;t allow files and folders to have the same name in the same path.</li>\n<li>This shows that it was weaponized after creating a regular zip by changing the bytes to make the file and folder name the same.</li>\n<li>Also, note there is a trailing space at the end of the file and folder name (in yellow).</li>\n<li>When we look inside the folder, we see many files, but the most important file is highlighted, which is a bat file containing a malicious script.</li>\n<li>The bat file also has the same name as the benign file outside the folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174478 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2.jpg 562w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-154x129.jpg 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174492 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"103\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-300x50.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-205x34.jpg 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When we check the script, we see it launches cmd in the minimized state, then goes to the temp folder where WinRAR will extract the files, then tries to find the weakicons.com file, which is present inside the folder and executes it using wmic and then exits.</li>\n<li>Checking weakicons.com we find that it is a CAB SFX file.<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174506 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-147x129.jpg 147w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></li>\n<li>We extract it to check what is inside.<br />\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174520 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5.jpg 577w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-205x89.jpg 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" /></li>\n<li>We found a PE file, some ActiveX control objects, and two text files.</li>\n<li>AMD.exe is a visual basic compiled file whose main job is to extract the dll hidden in a blob of data inside pc.txt and execute the ActiveX controls.</li>\n<li>Inside add.txt, we find the registry keys it will try to manipulate<br />\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174534 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"221\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/6.jpg 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/6-300x106.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/6-205x73.jpg 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></li>\n<li>The first control is responsible for registering a COM object in Windows.

Day</a>. Started in 2009, it’s an Australian non-profit suicide prevention that is all about having conversations with others to address social isolation and promote a sense of community. What I love the most, is that RUOK? Day has become quite an event on the Australian calendar. You’d be hard-pressed to find a workplace that doesn’t host a morning tea or a retailer that’s not selling a ribbon or badge in support of the day. In my opinion, it has given many of us the confidence to talk about mental health and that, my friends, is a very good thing!</p>\n<h2>When You’re Not Feeling OK</h2>\n<p>You wouldn’t be human if you hadn’t ever felt a little down or anxious. It’s the natural ebb and flow of daily life. However, if these symptoms are hanging around and are affecting your ability to ‘do’ life then, it’s time to take some action.</p>\n<p>Remember, it is incredibly common for someone to experience a dip in their mental health. <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/mental-health/topic-areas/mental-illness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recent research shows that over 2 in 5 Aussies aged 16 to 85 will experience a mental disorder at some time in their life</a>, with 1 in 5, experiencing a mental disorder in the previous 12 months.</p>\n<p>If you’re not feeling OK, the most important thing to remember is that you do not need to deal with this all by yourself. Sometimes when you’re feeling really low, the thought of leaving the house and facing the world can feel too much. I totally get it! And that’s where the online world can play a huge role. There is an abundance of resources available online for anyone who needs mental health support which makes it so much easier to get the help you need when facing the world just feel a bit much.</p>\n<h2>Where To Go Online When You’re Not Feeling OK</h2>\n<p>Here is a list of organisations that offer online mental health services here in Australia. This list is not exhaustive however these are the most commonly used, and hence best funded, support services. If you are based in the US, please find details at the end of the post for organisations that can provide mental health support.</p>\n<h3>When Things Are Pretty Dire</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Suicide Call-Back Service</a> offers free professional 24/7 counselling support to Aussies at risk of suicide, concerned about someone at risk, affected by suicide as well as people experiencing emotional or mental health issues. There is an option for telephone support as well as online chat and video counselling also.</li>\n<li>If you need to speak to someone ASAP then contact <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/crisis-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lifeline</a>. They offer a free 24/7 confidential one to one counselling service that can help you in a crisis. You can, of course, choose to speak to someone on the telephone (13 11 14) but you also have the option of either <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/crisis-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">messaging</a> or texting (0477 13 11 14) with a counsellor also.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond Blue</a> is another great Aussie mental health and wellbeing support service that can help in an emergency. Again, it offers 24/7 confidential counselling services for anyone who is struggling. Telephone counselling is an option here (1300 22 4636) but if you’d prefer, you can use their web chat option <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/support-service/chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Online Help Specifically For Young People</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kidshelpline.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kids Helpline</a> is a dedicated 24/7 support service for young people aged 5 to 25 who want to chat for any reason. It’s free (even from a mobile phone) and there is a choice of telephone counselling or support via <a href=\"https://kidshelpline.com.au/get-help/webchat-counselling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web chat</a> or <a href=\"https://kidshelpline.com.au/get-help/email-counselling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email</a>. You can also access support if you are an adult supporting a young person. Since it was established in 1991, the service has supported over 8.5 million people. The service offers everything from life-saving crisis intervention through to emotional support when young people just need someone to listen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://headspace.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headspace</a> is Australia’s Mental Health Young Foundation. It also provides free online and telephone support from 9am to 1am AEST, 7 days a week for young people (12-25) and their families. In addition to its crisis support services, it also offers regular counselling options through its network of 150 centres around Australia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Other Services </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://butterfly.org.au/get-support/chat-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Butterfly Foundation’s National Helpline</a> is a free confidential service that provides information, counselling, and treatment referral for people (and their families) with eating disorders and body image issues. It operates between 8am and midnight, 7 days a week and offers support via telephone (1800 33 4673), email and <a href=\"https://butterfly.org.au/get-support/chat-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web chat</a>. This is not a crisis service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://friendline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Friendline</a> is a telephone and chat support service for anyone who&#8217;s feeling lonely, needs to reconnect or just wants a chat. You can call them 7 days a week on 1800 424 287, or chat online with one of their trained volunteers. All conversations with FriendLine are anonymous. This is not a crisis service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MensLine Australia</a> is a professional telephone and online counselling service offering support to Australian men 24 hours/7days a week. Whether it’s addiction issues, domestic violence, anxiety or depression, the service is able to offer support on 1300 78 99 or via <a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/phone-and-online-counselling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online or video chat</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.openarms.gov.au/get-support/suicide-intervention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Arms</a> – Veterans and Families Counselling provides 24/7 free and confidential telephone and webchat counselling to anyone who has served at least one day in the Australian Defence Force, their partner, and their families. It isn’t a crisis service, but it can offer ongoing mental health treatment and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if you are not just yourself at the moment and are feeling really low – or you know someone that is – please know that there is help available online 24/7. So, make yourself a cuppa and get started because you are not alone.</p>\n<p>Alex xx</p>\n<p>P.S.

But their favorite type of cookie is of the browser variety.</p>\n<p>Browser cookies – often just referred to as cookies – track your comings and goings on websites. And when a cyber thief gets their mitts on your browser cookies, it can open all kinds of doors into your online accounts.</p>\n<p>The first step to protecting your devices and online privacy from criminals is to understand their schemes. Here are the key terms you need to know about cookie theft plus how to keep malicious software off your devices.</p>\n<h2><strong>Key Cookie Theft Terms You Should Know</strong></h2>\n<p>Cookie theft can happen to anyone. Knowing the basics of this cyberscheme may help you better protect your online life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Browser cookie.</strong> A small collection of data your internet browser stores every time you visit a website. When your browser stores this data, it makes it quicker for you to log back into a website or for a website to customize its suggestions for you the next time you visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Cache.</strong> Like a mouse scurrying away a pile of sweet treats, your device hoards – or caches – all the cookies you gather from websites you visit. Your cache of cookies will grow continually until you clear it out. If your cache grows too large, it could slow down your device, affect performance, or tax your battery power.</li>\n<li><strong>Multifactor authentication</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MFA</a> is a way to log in to an online account that requires additional forms of identification beyond a username and password. It could require biometric identification (like a face or fingerprint scan), a security question, or a one-time code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How and Why Do Criminals Steal Browser Cookies?</strong></h2>\n<p>Cookies thieves are generally motivated by the financial gains of breaking into people’s online accounts. Banking, social media, and online shopping accounts are full of valuable personal and financial details that a cybercriminal can either sell on the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-the-dark-web-the-answer-can-help-you-stay-safer-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dark web</a> or use to impersonate you and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steal your identity</a>.</p>\n<p>Malware is generally the vehicle cybercriminals use to steal cookies. Once the malicious software gets onto a device, the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malware</a> is trained to copy a new cookie’s data and send it to the cybercriminal. Then, from their own machine, the cybercriminal can input that data and start a new session with the target’s stolen data.</p>\n<p>There was a stretch of a few years where cookie thieves targeted high-profile YouTube influencers with malware spread through fake collaboration deals and crypto scams. The criminals’ goal was to steal cookies to sneak into the backend of the YouTube accounts to change passwords, recovery emails and phone numbers, and bypass two-factor authentication to lock the influencers out of their accounts.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>But you don’t have to have a valuable social media account to draw the eye of a cybercriminal. “Operation Cookie Monster” dismantled an online forum that sold stolen login information for millions of online accounts gained through cookie theft.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Best Practices for Secure Browsing</strong></h2>\n<p>To keep your internet cookies out of the hands of criminals, it’s essential to practice safe browsing habits. These four tips will go a long way toward keeping your accounts out of the reach of cookie thieves and your devices free from malicious software.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set up MFA.</strong> MFA may seem like it’ll slow down your login process, but really, the extra seconds it takes are well worth it. Most people have their phone within arm’s reach throughout the day, so a texted, emailed, or authentication app-generated code is easy enough to access. Just remember that a reputable company will never ask you for one-time codes, so these codes are for your eyes only. MFA makes it extremely difficult for a criminal to log into your accounts, even when they have your password and username. Without the unique code, a bad actor is locked out.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch out for phishing attempts and risky websites. </strong>Cookie-stealing malware often hops onto innocent devices through either phishing lures or through <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-whether-a-website-is-safe-or-unsafe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visiting untrustworthy sites</a>. Make sure to carefully read every text, email, and social media direct message. With the help of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpt-a-scammers-newest-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI content generation tools like ChatGPT</a>, phishers’ messages are more believable than they were years ago. Be especially diligent about clicking on links that may take you to risky sites or download malicious files onto your device.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear your cache regularly.</strong> Make it a habit to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-cache/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clear your cache</a> and browsing history often. This is a great practice to optimize the performance of your device. Plus, in the case that a cybercriminal does install cookie-stealing malware on your device, if you store hardly any cookies on your device, the thief will have little valuable information to pilfer.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> While a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> won’t protect your device from cookie-stealing malware, it will lessen your dependence upon storing valuable cookies. It’s convenient to already have your usernames and passwords auto-populate; however, if your device falls into the wrong hands these shortcuts could spell trouble for your privacy. A password manager is a vault for all your login information for your dozens of online accounts. All you need to do is input one master password, and from there, the password manager will autofill your logins. It’s just as quick and convenient, but infinitely more secure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Lock Up Your Cookie Jar</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a> is an excellent partner to help you secure your devices and digital life.

VBS files are script files used in Windows for automating tasks, configuring systems, and performing various actions. They can also be misused by cybercriminals to deliver malicious code and execute harmful actions on computers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>\n<p>The examined VBS file executed numerous PowerShell commands and then leveraged steganography to perform process injection into RegAsm.exe as shown in Figure 2. Regasm.exe is a Windows command-line utility used to register .NET assemblies as COM components, allowing interoperability between different software. It can also be exploited by malicious actors for purposes like process injection, potentially enabling covert or unauthorized operations.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-173874 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1348\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain.png 1348w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain-300x139.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain-1024x473.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain-768x355.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Injection_chain-205x95.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 2: Infection Chain</em></p>\n<p>VBS needs scripting hosts like wscript.exe to interpret and execute its code, manage interactions with the user, handle output and errors, and provide a runtime environment.

This strategy conceals its malicious code and actual objectives. Upon successful decoding, we were able to scrutinize its internal operations and functionalities, including the use of SMTP for data exfiltration.</p>\n<p>The observed sample utilizes SMTP as its chosen method of exfiltration. This protocol is frequently favored due to its minimal overhead demands on the attacker. SMTP reduces overhead for attackers because it is efficient, widely allowed in networks, uses existing infrastructure, causes minimal anomalies, leverages compromised accounts, and appears less suspicious compared to other protocols. A single compromised email account can be used for exfiltration, streamlining the process, and minimizing the need for complex setups. They can achieve their malicious goals with just a single email account, simplifying their operations.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174196 size-large\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-1024x615.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-1024x615.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-300x180.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-768x462.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-205x123.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration..png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 24: Function calls made for exfiltration.</em></p>\n<p>This is the procedure by which functions are invoked to facilitate data extraction via SMTP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A specific value is provided as a parameter, and this value is processed within the functions.

It begins with the initial vector, often using email attachments or other social engineering tactics. Once executed, the malware employs obfuscation to avoid detection during static analysis. The malware then undergoes decoding, revealing its true functionality. It orchestrates a sequence of PowerShell commands to download and process a hidden image containing encoded instructions. These instructions lead to the extraction of a .NET DLL file, which subsequently injects the final payload into the legitimate process &#8216;RegAsm.exe&#8217; using a series of API calls for process injection.

Many of us have embraced it with open arms and have put it to work by tasking it to ‘assist’ with assignments, write copy for an ad, or even pen a love letter – yes, it’s a thing. Personally, I have a love/hate relationship with it. As someone who writes for a living, it does ‘grind my gears’ but I am a big fan of its ability to create recipes with whatever I can find in my fridge. But like any new toy, if you don’t use it correctly then there could be issues – which may include your privacy.</p>\n<h2>ChatGPT – A Quick Recap</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT is an online software program developed by OpenAI that uses a new form of artificial intelligence – <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI</a> – to provide conversational, human-style responses to a broad array of requests. Think of it as Google on steroids. It can solve maths questions, translate copy, write jokes, develop a resume, write code, or even help you prepare for a job interview. If you want to know more, check out my <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parent’s Guide to ChatGPT</a>.</p>\n<p>But for ChatGPT to answer tricky questions and be so impressive, it needs a source for its ‘high IQ’. So, it relies on knowledge databases, open data sources and feedback from users. It also uses social media to gather information and a practice known as ‘web scraping’ to gather data from a multitude of sources online. And it is this super powerful combination that allows ChatGPT to ‘almost always’ deliver on tasks.</p>\n<h2>Why Does Generative AI Pose A Threat To My Privacy?</h2>\n<p>Your privacy can be affected in several ways. While I discuss some specifics on ChatGPT, similar concerns apply to other generative AI programs. Some of these ways may not concern you, but I’m quite sure some will. Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<h3>1. ChatGPT May be Using Your Data Without Your Express Permission</h3>\n<p>When ChatGPT (along with many similar tools) absorbed the enormous amount of data it needed to function from sources like books, articles, and web pages, they did so without seeking case-by-case permission. As certain data can be used to identify us, our friends and family or even our location, this can present privacy concerns. Some authors have already filed complaints for usage of their content without compensation, despite ChatGPT offering users a premium package for US$20/month. Recently, many online news outlets have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>blocked </u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>OpenA</u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>I</u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>’s crawler </u></a>which will limit ChatGPT’s  ability to access their news content.</p>\n<h3>2. Whatever You Share With ChatGPT Goes Into Its Data Bank</h3>\n<p>Every time you share a piece of information with ChatGPT, you are adding to its data bank, risking that the information ends up somewhere in the public domain. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) recently issued a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-28/ama-calls-for-national-regulations-for-ai-in-health/102381314\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mandate for Western Australian doctors</a> not to use ChatGPT after doctors at a Perth hospital used it to write patient notes. These confidential patient notes could be used to not only further train ChatGPT but could theoretically also be included in responses to other users.</p>\n<h3>3. ChatGPT Collects A Lot Of Information About Its Users</h3>\n<p>In addition to collecting the information users share, it also collects detailed information about its users. In the <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">company’s privacy policy</a>, it outlines that it collects users’ IP addresses and browser types. It also collects information on the behaviour of its users e.g. the type of content that users engage with as well as the features they use. It also says that it may share users’ <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal information</a> with unspecified parties, without informing them, to meet their business operation needs.</p>\n<h3>4. Risk of a Data Breach</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest risks to using ChatGPT and similar generative AI is the risk that your details will be leaked in a data breach. Between 100,000 ChatGPT accounts credentials were compromised and sold on the Dark Web in a large data beach which happened between June 2022 to May 2023, <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/massive-leak-of-chatgpt-credentials-over-100000-accounts-affected/489801/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Search Engine Journal</a>.</p>\n<p>But here’s another potential problem – as ChatGPT users can store conversations, if a hacker gains access to an account, it may mean they also gain access into propriety information, sensitive business information or even confidential personal information.</p>\n<h2>What’s ChatGPT Doing To Protect Privacy?</h2>\n<p>Now please don’t misunderstand me, ChatGPT is taking action to protect users but it may not be enough to truly protect your privacy.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT does make it very clear that all conversations between a user and ChatGPT are protected by end-to-end encryption. It also outlines that strict access controls are in place so only authorised personnel can access sensitive user data. It also runs a <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bug Bounty program</a> which rewards ethical hackers for finding security vulnerabilities. However, in order to remain protected while using the app, I believe the onus is on the user to take additional steps to protect their own privacy.</p>\n<h2>So, What Can I Do To Protect My Privacy?</h2>\n<p>As we all know, nothing is guaranteed in life however there are steps you can take to minimise the risk of your privacy being compromised. Here are my top tips:</p>\n<h3>1. Be Careful What You Share With ChatGPT and Other Platforms</h3>\n<p>Never share personal or sensitive information in any of your prompts. By doing so, you increase the risk of sharing confidential data with cybercriminals. If you need a sensitive piece of writing edited, ask a friend!!</p>\n<h3>2. Consider Deleting Your Chat History</h3>\n<p>One of the most useful ways of safeguarding your privacy is to avoid saving your chat history. By default, ChatGPT stores all conversations between users and the chatbot with the aim of training OpenAI’s systems. If you do choose not to save your chat history, OpenAI will store your conversations for 30 days. Despite this, it is still one of the best steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>\n<h3>3. Stay Anonymous</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, ChatGPT can collect and process highly sensitive data and associate it with your email address and phone number. So, why not set up a dedicated email just for ChatGPT? And keep your shared personal details to a minimum. That way, the questions you ask or content you share can’t be associated with your identity. And always use a pseudonym to mask your true identity.</p>\n<h3>4. Commit To Staying Up To Date</h3>\n<p>Whether it’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard, it’s imperative that you stay up to date with the company’s privacy and data retention policies, so you understand how your data is managed. Find out how long your conversations will be stored for before they are anonymised or deleted and who your details could potentially be shared with.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re looking for a recipe for dinner, ideas for an upcoming birthday party or help with a love letter, by all means get ChatGPT working for you. However, use a dedicated email address, don’t store your conversations and NEVER share sensitive information in the chat box. But if you need help with a confidential or sensitive issue, then maybe find another alternative. Why not phone a friend – on an encrypted app, of course!!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpts-impact-on-privacy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/\">ChatGPT&#8217;s Impact on Privacy and How to Protect Yourself</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Future of Work: How Technology & the WFH Landscape Are Making an Impact","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-future-of-work-technology-and-the-wfh-landscape/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 14:00:51 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"network security"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersafety"},{"#cdata-section":"internet security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"IoT"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=101826"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>As of the writing of this article, the height of the pandemic seems like a distant but still vivid dream....</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-future-of-work-technology-and-the-wfh-landscape/\">The Future of Work: How Technology &#038; the WFH Landscape Are Making an Impact</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>As of the writing of this article, the height of the pandemic seems like a distant but still vivid dream. Sanitizing packages, sparse grocery shelves, and video conferencing happy hours are things of the past for the majority of the population. Thank goodness.</p>\n<p>A “new normal” society is adapting to today’s working culture. The work landscape changed significantly since 2020, and it might never return to what it once was. In 2022, workers spent an average 3.5 days in the office per week, which is 30% below the prepandemic in-office average.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The work-from-home movement is likely here to stay, to the joy of employees seeking a better work-life balance and flexibility; however, some responsibility does fall upon people like you to secure home offices to protect sensitive company information.</p>\n<p>To make sure you’re not the weak cyber link in your company’s security, make sure to follow these three tips for a secure home office.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Lock Your Screen, Stow Your Device</strong></h2>\n<p>When you’re not physically in front of your work computer, best practices dictate that you lock the screen or put your device to sleep. No matter how much you trust your family, roommates, or the trustworthy-looking person seated next to you at a café, your company device houses all kinds of corporate secrets. A stray glance from the wrong person could put that information’s secrecy in jeopardy. Plus, imagine your cat walking across your keyboard or a toddler mashing your mouse, deleting hours’ worth of work. Disastrous.</p>\n<p>Then, when you’re done with work for the day, stow your device in a secure location, preferably a drawer with a lock. Even if your work computer is 10 times faster and sleeker than your personal laptop, keep each device in its designated sphere in your life: work devices only for work, personal devices only for personal activities.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Secure Your Home Wi-Fi</strong></h2>\n<p>Wi-Fi networks that are not password protected invite anyone off the street to surf on your network and eavesdrop on your online activities. A stranger sneaking on to your home Wi-Fi could be dangerous to your workplace. There would be very little stopping a stranger from spying on your connected work devices and spreading confidential information onto the dark web or leaking company secrets to the media.</p>\n<p>There are a few steps you can take to secure your home office’s internet connection. First, make sure to change the default name and password of your router. Follow <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password best practices</a> to create a strong first defense. For your router name, choose an obscure inside joke or a random pairing of nouns and adjectives. It’s best to omit your address and your real name as the name of your router, because that could alert a cybercriminal that that network belongs to you. Better yet, you can hide your router completely from strangers and only make it searchable to people who know the exact name of your network.</p>\n<p>For an additional layer of protection, connect to a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-a-vpn-how-it-can-make-your-time-online-more-private-and-secure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual private network</a> (VPN). Your company may offer a corporate VPN. If not, signing up for your own VPN is easy. A VPN encrypts the traffic coming in and going out of your devices making it nearly impossible for a cybercriminal to burst into your online session and see what’s on your screen.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Take Your Security Training Seriously</strong></h2>\n<p>The scenarios outlined in your company’s security training may seem far-fetched, but the concepts of those boring corporate videos actually happen! For example, the huge Colonial Pipeline breach in 2021 originated from one employee who didn’t secure the company’s VPN with multifactor authentication (MFA).<sup>2 </sup>Cutting small corners like disabling MFA – which is such a basic and easy-to-use security measure – can have dire consequences.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to your security training and make sure to follow all company cybersecurity rules and use security tools as your IT team intends. For example, if your company requires that everyone use a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a>, a corporate VPN, and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/protect-your-social-media-passwords-from-hacks-and-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-factor authentication</a>, do so! And use them correctly every workday!</p>\n<h2><strong>Secure Home Office, Secure Home</strong></h2>\n<p>These tips are essential to a secure home office, but they’re also applicable to when you’re off the clock. Password- or passcode-protecting your personal laptop, smartphone, and tablet keeps prying eyes out of your devices, which actually hold more <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personally identifiable information</a> (PII) than you may think. Password managers, a secure router, VPNs, and safe browsing habits will go a long way toward maintaining your online privacy.</p>\n<p>To fill in the cracks to better protect your home devices and your PII, partner with <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a>. McAfee+ includes a VPN, safe browsing tool, identity monitoring and remediation services, a password manager, and more for a more secure digital life.</p>\n<p>In one global survey, 68% of people prefer hybrid work models, and nearly three-quarters of companies allow employees to work from home some of the time.<sup>3,4 </sup>The flexibility afforded by hybrid work and 100% work-from-home policies is amazing. Cutting out the time and cost of commuting five days a week is another bonus.

All the things that make USB drives attractive to us make them attractive to hackers. They’re inexpensive, portable, and often swap between users. Taken together, that creates the perfect medium for hosting and distributing malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, USB drives can get lost or stolen quite easily. An absentminded or careless moment could put sensitive information at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">However, that’s not to say you should avoid using USB drives. Not at all. In fact, you can use them securely by taking a few straightforward steps.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to protect your USB drive from malware and loss</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Encrypt your USB drive.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Encryption gives you huge peace of mind in the event you lose your USB drive. It prevents others from accessing the data and files on it by scrambling them. Only a person with the password can access them. </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/how-and-why-to-encrypt-usb-flash-drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Windows users can check out this “how to” article on encryption</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">—</span><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-your-mac-information-with-encryption-mh40593/mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Apple users can learn about encryption on their support site</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Purchase a USB drive with encryption built in.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you’d rather skip those steps, you can purchase a USB drive that uses hardware-based encryption built in. These drives cost a little more, yet they more than make up for that in the protection that they offer. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keep your USB drive on you.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Physical security is important too. You can prevent loss and theft by toting around your drive in your pocket, bag, or purse. Locking it away in a secure location while you’re not using it stands as a solid option as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Mind your sharing.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">You never know what malware might be lurking on someone else’s device. Sharing a USB drive with someone else can help malware make the jump from their device to yours. Think twice before sharing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Watch out for USB devices in the wild.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don’t put it past hackers to load a USB drive with malware in the hopes that someone will pick it up. In fact, </span><a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/sogu-snowydrive-malware-usb-based-cyberattacks-surge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">several large malware campaigns got their start by mailing “free” USB drives</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> to thousands and thousands of households, businesses, and government agencies.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Disable AutoPlay.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">On Windows computers, you can prevent USB drives from automatically running any files. Some malware will run when the drive gets inserted into the device.

And that asterisk is known as spyware. Spyware can use your phone for snooping in several ways, including using your camera to take pictures and videos.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What exactly is spyware? It’s any software or app that steals information from a device and passes it to another party without the victim’s knowledge. And here’s the tricky part—you might have installed it yourself, right from an app store. In other words, you can end up with spyware without a hacker installing it on your phone via a malicious download or link.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fortunately, you can avoid spyware rather easily.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How do phones take pictures and videos without your knowledge?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">First off, it helps to know how spyware can take over your phone’s camera.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It comes down to permissions. Apps require permissions to do things like access your contacts, photo library, microphone, and camera. For example, a social media app will ask for permission to access your camera if you want to snap a pic and post it online. A messaging app might ask for access to your camera and microphone to send video and voice messages. Likewise, a navigation or rideshare app will ask for permission to access your phone’s location services. Depending on your specific settings, your app might ask for permissions each time you use it, or you might give an app blanket permissions the first time you use it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Effectively, permissions make apps go. Yet some apps cross the line. They ask for invasive permissions that they absolutely don’t need to function. A classic example is the glut of old flashlight apps that asked for permission to access things like contact lists and cameras. With those permissions, bad actors stole all manner of personal information. In some cases, they used the phone’s camera and microphone to spy on their victims. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That old “flashlight app” ruse continues today. You’ll occasionally see </span><a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/beware-android-users-some-google-play-store-apps-are-infected-with-spyware-uninstall-them-right-now-2395792-2023-06-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">reports</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> of spyware cropping up in app stores.

Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">after</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt malicious code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Unique to Android phones, Android gives people the option to download apps from third-party app stores.

It starts out like many. Amber wanted a job that allowed remote work, and luckily enough, a recruiter reached out to her through an online recruiting site with an opportunity.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, the recruiter directed Amber to download a messaging app, which the company would use for the interview process. The interview went just fine, Amber got a job offer, and then the company asked Amber for a home address.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Here&#8217;s where the catch comes in. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Amber goes on to say that the company sent her a check by overnight mail, a check she should use to buy equipment. A check for nearly $5,000. For days, the check didn’t post. The company repeatedly asked for update. Had it posted yet? Had it posted yet? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">At this point, Amber said she got suspicious. She contacted her bank. The check had a hold placed on it, and according to Amber, she was charged a fee and her account frozen for days. In speaking with her bank, Amber was told that the check was bad and that she was the victim of a scam. The bank has seen a lot of it lately, said Amber.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet based on what we’ve seen, Amber got lucky.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What do online job scams look like?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Victims and banks sometimes fail to spot the scam as it unfolds. In those cases, the check gets posted and the scammers tell the victim to forward the money to another person who’ll purchase equipment for them. Usually by way of an online payment app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Days later, the check bounces for insufficient funds. Meanwhile, victims get burdened with the fraud reporting process — with their bank and with the payment app they used. Depending on the means and terms of payment, some or all of that money might be gone for good. And as a result, the scammers get a few thousand dollars richer.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you spend some time on social media, you’ll stumble across plenty of videos that tell this exact story in one form or another. And with each story, you’ll find dozens of people sharing that the same thing happened, or almost happened, to them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We’re glad people are taking to TikTok to share their stories, even as sharing those stories can get painful. You can avoid these scams. Part of it involves awareness. They’re still going strong. The next part counts on you and your sharp eye to spot sketchy behavior when you see it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We’ll show you how, and that begins with a look at where these scams take place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online job scams — what’s going on out there?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Employment figures continue to surge. It’s a hot job market out there, and when things get hot, you’ll find scammers looking to turn a buck. It’s much like tax season and gift-giving holidays. Scammers will take advantage of trends and seasonal events where people go online and there’s money involved.

Scammers will either set up a bogus company or pose as a representative of a legitimate company. In other cases, job scams take root on social media. Here, scammers play the same game—set up a bogus company or impersonate a legitimate one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, stories like Amber’s unfold.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Without question, recruiting and social media platforms know what’s going on and take steps to quash scam accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://about.linkedin.com/transparency/community-report#fake-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">LinkedIn’s latest community report cited the removal of more than 21 million fake accounts in the first half of 2022</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Stopped at registration – 16.4 million accounts. </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Restricted proactively before members reported – 5.4 million accounts. </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Restricted after members reported – 190 thousand accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, </span><a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook/#content-actioned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Facebook took action on 426 million fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> in Q1 of 2023 alone, with nearly 99% of them acted on before users reported them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In its guidelines for a safe job search, </span><a href=\"https://support.indeed.com/hc/en-us/articles/216354123-Guidelines-for-Safe-Job-Search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Indeed</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> mentions the global teams “dedicated to the safety and authenticity of the jobs posted on our platform.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Still, some scammers make their way through to these platforms and others like them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online job scams — here’s what to look out for:</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our earlier advice on the topic still holds true. You can spot scams several ways, particularly when you know that scammers want your money and personal information as quickly as possible. The moment any so-called job offer asks for any of those, a red flag should immediately go up. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s possibly a scam if: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They ask for your Social Security or tax ID number. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the hands of a scammer, your SSN or tax ID is the key to your identity. With it, they can open up bank cards, lines of credit, apply for insurance benefits, collect benefits and tax returns, or even commit crimes, all in your name. Needless to say, scammers will ask for it, perhaps under the guise of a background check or for payroll purposes. The only time you should provide your SSN or tax ID is when you know that you have accepted a legitimate job with a legitimate company. Only sent it through a secure document signing service, never via email, text, or over the phone. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They want your banking information. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another trick scammers rely on is asking for bank account information so that they can wire a payment to you. As with the SSN above, closely guard this information and treat it in exactly the same way. Don’t give it out unless you have a legitimate job with a legitimate company. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They want you to pay before you get paid. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Some scammers will take a different route. They’ll promise employment, but first you’ll need to pay them for training, onboarding, or equipment before you can start work. Legitimate companies won’t make these kinds of requests. Amber’s check story provides a good example of this.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They tell you to download a specific messaging app to communicate with them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Victims report that the scammers require a specific app to chat and, sometimes, to conduct the interview itself. Apps like Signal and Wire get mentioned, yet rest assured that these apps themselves are legitimate. The scammers are the problem, not the apps. Consider it a warning sign if someone asks you to largely communicate this way. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Other signs of a job scam — more red flags to look for: </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Aside from the types of information they ask for, the way they ask for your information offers other clues that you might find yourself mixed up in a scam. Look out for the following as well: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) The offer is big on promises but short on details. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">You can sniff out many online scams with the “too good to be true” test. Scammers often make big promises during the holidays with low-priced offers for hard-to-get holiday gifts and then don’t deliver. It’s the same with job scams. The high pay, the low hours, and even the offer of things like a laptop and other perks, these are signs that a job offer might be a scam. Moreover, when pressed for details about this seemingly fantastic job opportunity, scammers might balk. Or they might come back with incomplete or inconsistent replies because the job doesn’t exist at all. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2) They communicate only through email or chat. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Job scammers hide behind their screens. They use the anonymity of the internet to their advantage. Job scammers likewise create phony profiles on networking and social media websites, which means they won’t agree to a video chat or call, which are commonly used in legitimate recruiting today. If your job offer doesn’t involve some sort of face-to-face communication, that indicates it might be a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3) And the communications seem a lit</span></b><strong>tle …off.  </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers now have an additional tool to reel in their victims — AI chatbots like Chat GPT, which can generate email correspondence, chats, LinkedIn profiles, and other content in seconds so they can bilk victims on a huge scale. However, AI has its limits. Right now, it tends to use shorter sentences in a way that seems like it’s spitting out information. There’s little story or substance to the content it creates. That might be a sign of a scam. Likewise, even without AI, you might spot a recruiter using technical or job-related terms in unusual ways, as if they’re unfamiliar with the work they’re hiring for. That’s another potential sign. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">4) Things move too quickly. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers love quick conversion. Yet job seekers today know that interview processes are typically long and involved, often relying on several rounds of interviews and loops. If a job offer comes along without the usual rigor and the recruiter is asking for personal information practically right away, that’s another near-certain sign of a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">5) You get job offers on Facebook or other social media sites not associated with job searches. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This is another red flag. Legitimate businesses stick to platforms associated with networking for business purposes, typically not networking for families, friends, and interests. Why do scammers use sites like Facebook anyway? They’re a gold mine of information. By trolling public profiles, they have access to years of posts and armloads of personal information on thousands of people, which they can use to target their attacks. This is another good reason to set your social media profiles on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and other friend-oriented sites to private so that scammers of all kinds, not just job scammers, can’t use your information against you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Further ways you can protect yourself from job scams. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As a job hunter you know that getting the right job requires some research. You look up the company, dig into their history—the work they do, how long they’ve been at it, where their locations are, and maybe even read some reviews provided by current or former employees. When it comes to job offers that come out of the blue, it calls for taking that research a step further.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">After all, is that business really a business, or is it really a scam? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the U.S., you have several resources that can help you answer that question. </span><a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) offers a searchable listing of businesses</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> in the U.S., along with a brief profile, a rating, and even a list of complaints (and company responses) waged against them.

Your credit card number while you shop. Your password when you bank. That confidential contract you just sent to a </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">client.

Network analyzers, or packet sniffers as many call them, can read the data traffic that travels across a network.

This keeps your online activity private on any network, shielding it from prying eyes. Thus, while you’re on a VPN, you can browse and bank with the confidence that your passwords, credentials, and financial information are secure. If any malicious actors attempt to intercept your web traffic, they’ll only see garbled content, thanks to your VPN’s encryption functionality.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN change my IP address?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every internet connection is assigned a unique set of numbers called an IP address, which is tied to information such as geographic location or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). A VPN replaces your actual IP address to make it look like you’ve connected to the internet from the physical location of the VPN server, rather than your real location. This is just one </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">reason</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> so many people use VPNs.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How can I use a VPN to change my IP address? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To change your IP address, you open your VPN app, select the server location you’d like to connect to, and you’re done. You’re now browsing with a new IP address. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When should I use a VPN?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">An ideal case for using a VPN is when you’re using public Wi-Fi at the airport, a café, hotel, or just about any place “free Wi-Fi” is offered. The reason being is that these are open networks, and any somewhat enterprising cybercriminal can tap into these networks and harvest sensitive information as a result. One survey showed that </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/731556/worldwide-public-wifi-safety-awareness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">39% of internet users worldwide understand public Wi-Fi is unsafe</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, yet some users still bank, shop, and do other sensitive things on public Wi-Fi despite the understood risks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, you have your privacy to consider. You can use a VPN to help stop advertisers from tracking you. Searches you perform and websites you visit won’t get traced back to you, which can prevent advertisers from gleaning information about you and your online habits in general. Moreover, some ISPs collect the browsing history of their users and share it with advertisers and other third parties. A VPN can prevent this type of collection as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Can a VPN protect my search history?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN protects your search history through the secure connection you share. When you search for a website, or type a URL into your navigation bar, your device sends something called a DNS request, which translates the website into the IP address of the web server.

Your IP address is visible to your network provider and to the first relay, which is operated by Apple. Your DNS records are encrypted, so neither party can see the address of the website you’re trying to visit. The second relay, which is operated by a third-party content provider, generates a temporary IP address, decrypts the name of the website you requested, and connects you to the site. All of this is done using the latest internet standards to maintain a high-performance browsing experience while protecting your privacy.</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Check to see if Apple Private Relay is available in your country or region.

It’s an extra layer of defense for your accounts. In practice, it means that in addition to providing a password, you also receive a special one-time-use code to access your account. That code </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be sent to you via email or to your phone by text. In some cases, you can also receive that code by a call to your phone. Basically, two-factor authentication combines two things: something you know, like your password; and something you have, like your smartphone. Together, that makes it tougher for scammers to hack into your accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Two-factor authentication is practically a standard, so much so that you already might be using it right now when you bank or use certain accounts. If not, you can see if your bank offers it as an option in your settings the next time you log in. Or, you can contact your bank for help to get it set up.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Avoid phishing attacks: Look at your email inbox with a skeptical eye</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing is a popular way for crooks to steal personal information by way of email, where a crook will look to phish (“fish”) personal and financial information out of you. No two phishing emails look alike. They can range from a request from a stranger posing as a lawyer who wants you to </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">help</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with a bank transfer—to an announcement about (phony) lottery </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">winnings.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> “Just send us your bank information and we’ll send your prize to you!” Those are a couple of classics. However, phishing emails have become much more sophisticated in recent years. Now, slicker hackers will pose as banks, online stores, and credit card companies, often using well-designed emails that look almost the same as the genuine article.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Of course, those emails are fakes. The links they embed in those emails lead you to them, so they can steal your personal info or redirect a payment their way. One telltale sign of a phishing email is if the sender used an address that slightly alters the brand name or adds to it by tacking extra language at the end of it. If you get one of these emails, don’t click any of the links. Contact the institute in question using a phone number or address posted on their official website. This is a good </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">guideline</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> in general. The best avenue of communication is the one you’ve used and trusted before.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be skeptical about calls as well.

In fact, they rely on the fact that many still see the phone as a trusted line of communication. This is known as “vishing,” which is short for “voice phishing.” The aim is the same as it is with phishing. The fraudster is looking to lure you into a bogus financial transaction or attempting to steal information, whether that’s financial, personal, or both. They </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> call you directly, posing as your bank or even as tech support from a well-known company, or they </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> send you a text or email that directs you to call their number.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, a crook </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> call and introduce themselves as being part of your bank or credit card company with a line like “there are questions about your account” or something similar. In these cases, politely hang up. Next, call your bank or credit card company to follow up on your own. If the initial call was legitimate, you’ll quickly find out and can handle the issue properly. If you get a call from a scammer, they can be very persuasive. Remember, though. You’re in charge. You can absolutely hang up and then follow up using a phone number you trust.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Steer clear of financial transactions on public Wi-Fi in cafes, hotels, and libraries</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s a good reason not to use public Wi-Fi: it’s not private. They’re public networks, and that means they’re unsecure and shared by everyone who’s using it, which allows hackers to read any data passing along it like an open book. That includes your accounts and passwords if you’re doing any banking or shopping on it. The best advice here is to wait and handle those things at home if possible. (Or connect to public Wi-Fi with a VPN service, which we’ll cover below in a moment.) </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If not, you can always use your smartphone’s data connection to create a personal hotspot for your laptop, which will be far more secure. Another option is to use your smartphone alone. With a combination of your phone’s data connection and an app from your bank, you can take care of business that way instead of using public Wi-Fi. That said, be aware of your physical surroundings too.

In some cases, users received ransom notes for the return of their hacked accounts.</p>\n<p>It appears that LinkedIn is weathering a wave of brute-force attacks. This type of attack works much like it sounds—hackers try to force their way into accounts by guessing passwords. With powerful hacking apps, they can guess millions of passwords in seconds.</p>\n<p>As a result, one of two things is happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LinkedIn users receive an official, legitimate email from LinkedIn alerting them that their account has been locked due to unusual activity. This measure likely kicked in because of a brute force attack or because the attack occurred on an account using two-factor authentication. In this case, the account wasn&#8217;t compromised. However, these users then must reactivate their accounts per instructions provided by LinkedIn.</li>\n<li>Users try to log in and find that their password has been changed. Effectively, their account has been hacked. Reports show that some of these accounts get deleted. In other cases, the hacker changes the account’s email to an address using the “rambler.ru” domain, which makes the account unrecoverable by the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the scope, scale, and consistent use of the rambler.ru domain, this has all the signs of an organized attack. As of this writing, no group has claimed credit.</p>\n<h2><strong>How quickly can someone hack my password with a brute force attack?</strong></h2>\n<p>If any event underscores the need for strong, unique passwords, this is it.</p>\n<p>Given today’s computing power, the password generators hackers use for brute force attacks can create millions of passwords in seconds. Weak passwords have no chance against them. It’s a simple matter of statistics.</p>\n<p>Consider a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/create-strong-passwords-with-a-password-generator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password</a> that uses eight numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols. Sounds pretty strong, right? Unfortunately, a brute force attack might crack that password in as fast as one second.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">\n<h3><strong>Password Length</strong></h3>\n<h5><strong>(Using numbers, uppercase </strong><strong>and lowercase letters, and symbols)</strong></h5>\n</td>\n<td width=\"216\">\n<h3><strong>Time to Crack </strong><strong>the Password</strong></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">8</td>\n<td width=\"216\">One Second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">12</td>\n<td width=\"216\">Eight Months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">16</td>\n<td width=\"216\">16 Million Years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, increase that password length to twelve numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols—it’d that eight months to crack that password. Bump it up to 16, and it would take 16 million years. The longer it is, the more complex it is. And thus tougher to crack. It’s the difference between one second and 16 million years. And if a hacker’s brute force attack on one password takes too long, it’ll simply move onto the next one.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to protect yourself from the LinkedIn attacks.</strong></h2>\n<p>Log into your LinkedIn account now and verify that it’s indeed secure. Then, take the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication.</strong> You’ll find this in your security settings. Using two-factor authentication makes hacking your account far, far more difficult than hacking it with password protection alone.</li>\n<li><strong>Set a new password.</strong> Make it strong and unique, using numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols. As illustrated above, the longer the better—14 or even up to 16 characters.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm your contact email.</strong> LinkedIn will alert users of unusual activity. Ensure that the contact information in your account profile uses an email address that you regularly check.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to create your own strong, unique password. One that you can still remember.</strong></h2>\n<p>Fourteen characters? Even up to 16 characters? How do you create that without just mashing on your keyboard? (Not recommended.) A layered password can do the work. It’s a way of creating a phrase and turning it into a strong, unique password that you can still remember.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick a phrase that is memorable for you: </strong>Don’t use easily discovered information, like your birthdate or pet’s name. Try something linked with an interest or hobby. If you’re an avid runner, you might choose a phrase like, “Running 26.2 Rocks!”</li>\n<li><strong>Replace letters with numbers and symbols: </strong>Remove the spaces. Then, you can put symbols and numbers in the place of some of the letters. Runn1ng26.2R0ck$!</li>\n<li><strong>Include a mix of letter cases: </strong>Finally, you want lower and uppercase letters that aren&#8217;t in a clear pattern. Algorithms know how to look for common patterns like <em>camelCase</em> or <em>PascalCase</em>. Runn1NG26.2R0cK$!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, you have a 17-character password that challenges hackers and that’s still something you can remember.</p>\n<h2><strong>Or, have a password manager handle the strong, unique passwords for you.</strong></h2>\n<p>Granted, creating strong, unique passwords for dozens and dozens of accounts can take a bit of time. (To put it mildly.) It can take yet more time if you manage them, such as if change them regularly (which can help protect you from data breaches and brute force attacks like this one at LinkedIn). Here, a password manager can help.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> can create, memorize, and store strong, unique passwords. It’ll use the random numbers, letters, and characters we mentioned earlier. The passwords won’t be memorable, but the manager does the memorizing for you. You can also use it to update passwords regularly. In a time of data breaches, this offers you extra protection. Taken together, every account you have gets powerful password protection when you hand the job over to a password manager.</p>\n<h2><strong>Log in now and secure your LinkedIn account.</strong></h2>\n<p>This wave of attacks reminds us just how powerful, or weak, our passwords can be. A strong, unique password in conjunction with two-factor authentication stands as your best defense as LinkedIn weathers these attacks. Strengthen your security.</p>\n<p>Strengthen your other accounts as well. Hackers target websites and platforms of all sizes, and not every attack makes the headlines. Strong security measures for each of your accounts will protect you best if you end up as a hacker’s target.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-safeguard-your-linkedin-account-and-strengthen-your-security/\">How to Safeguard Your LinkedIn Account and Strengthen Your Security</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Be on the Lookout for Scam Tech Support Calls","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/lookout-scam-tech-support-calls/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 14:30:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://blogs.mcafee.com/?p=52683"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Instead of getting you out of a jam, tech support scams get you into one.

Other times, they’ll install information-stealing malware under the guise of software that’s supposed to correct an issue. In some cases, they’ll ask for remote access to your computer to perform a diagnosis, but access your computer to steal information instead. Or they could hit you with several of the above.</p>\n<p>You can stumble across these scams on your own as you go about your day online. Other times, they find you, such as when the scammer calls you directly.</p>\n<p>One of our employees shared his story when a tech support scammer called his wife out of the blue:</p>\n<p>I was messing around on my computer before dinner. My wife came in with a strange look on her face as she told the person on the phone, “I think you might want to talk to my husband about that.” Once on the phone I was greeted with, “Hi, this is Rick from Windows support and we’re calling because your computer is sending junk files to the internet.” I knew there was no way he was from “Windows support” since a reputable company isn’t going to call me up out of the blue like this, but as a security researcher I was curious, so I jumped right in.</p>\n<p>“Rick” said that to fix my issue he needed me to install a free remote access tool and give him access to my system. Letting an unknown person access my actual computer seemed like a bad idea, so I let him log on to a “virtual machine” that I use for security testing. The first thing he did was turn off my security software, including the antivirus and firewall. After doing that, he downloaded a file that he tried to install. Since I had additional security software in place he wasn’t aware of, the installation failed each time he tried to run it. At this point, I had the file he was trying to install, the IP address he was connecting from, and the site he used to get the malicious file. I told “Rick” that I work for a security company and would like to know what he was actually looking for. I’m fairly certain he hung up before I completed my sentence.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, after the call, a malware scan confirmed that “Rick” wanted to install a remote access tool (RAT) that would have given him full control of the computer.</p>\n<p>That’s one example of how these scams go. They get costly too. The FBI further reported that the average loss for a tech support scam approached $25,000. In some <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-tech-support-scammers-targeting-financial-accounts-using-remote-desktop-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cases</a>, pop-up “security alert” ads spearheaded scams that cost people $200,000 and upwards to $1 million.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these scams are rather easy to spot. And avoid. If you know what to look for.</p>\n<h2><strong> What do tech support scams look like?</strong></h2>\n<p>Let’s start with a quick overview of tech support scams. They tend to work in two primary ways.</p>\n<h3><strong>First, there are the scams that track you down.</strong></h3>\n<p>This might be a phone call that comes from someone posing as a rep from “Microsoft” or “Apple.” The scammer on the other end of the line will tell you that there’s something wrong with your computer or device. Something <em>urgently </em>wrong. And then offers a bogus solution to the bogus problem, often at a high cost. Similarly, they might reach you by way of a pop-up ad. Again telling you that your computer or device needs urgent repairs. These can find you a few different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By clicking on links from unsolicited emails.</li>\n<li>From pop-up ads from risky sites.</li>\n<li>Via pop-ups from otherwise legitimate sites that have had malicious ads injected.</li>\n<li>By way of spammy phone calls made directly to you, whether by <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/smartphone-security-five-steps-beating-and-blocking-robocalls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robocall</a> or a live operator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Second, there are the scams that lie in wait. </strong></h3>\n<p>These are phony services and sites that pose as legitimate tech support but are anything but. They’ll place search ads, post other ads on social media, and so forth, ready for you to look up and get in touch with when you have a problem that you need fixed. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online classified ads, forum posts, and blog sites.</li>\n<li>Ads on Social media sites such as Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, and Tumblr.</li>\n<li>Search results—scammers place paid search ads too!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to spot and avoid tech support scams</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With regards to ads and search results, keep an eye open for typos, awkward language, or poor design and logos that look like they could be a knockoff of a trusted brand. Check our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/top-tips-to-spot-tech-support-scams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top tips to spot tech support scams</a> of what these ads and search results look like.</li>\n<li>Don’t fall for the call. If someone calls you with an offer of “tech support.” Chances are, it’s a scam. And if they ask for payment in gift cards or cryptocurrency like bitcoin, it’s absolutely a scam. Just hang up.</li>\n<li>Note that big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft <em>won&#8217;t call you </em>with offers of tech support or an alert that “something is wrong with your computer.” Such calls come from imposters. Moreover, in many cases, the company will offer free support as part of your purchase or subscription that you can get on your own when you need it. (For example, <a href=\"https://service.mcafee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that’s the case with our products</a>.)</li>\n<li>Don’t click or tap on any links or call any numbers that suddenly appear on your screen and warn you of a computer problem. Again, this is a likely sign of an attempted scam. Often, this will happen while browsing. Simply close your browser and open a fresh browser window to clear the ad or link.</li>\n<li>Go to the source. Contact the company directly for support, manually type their address into your browser, or call the number that came with the packaging or purchase. Don’t search. This will help you avoid imposters that clog up search results with bogus ads.</li>\n<li>Protect your browsing. Use a web protection extension that can spot malicious sites and help prevent you from clicking on them by mistake. Comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online protection software</a> will offer protection for your browsing, in addition to protection from malware and viruses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-remove-personal-information-from-data-broker-sites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Remove your personal info from data broker sites</a>. How did that scammer get your phone number in the first place? Scammers often purchase personal information in bulk from data broker sites, which can include your phone number. Our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> can help you remove your information from some of the riskiest data broker sites out there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, a good piece of general advice is to keep your devices and apps up to date. Regular updates often include security fixes and improvements that can help keep scammers and hackers at bay. You can set your devices and apps to download them automatically. And if you need to get an update or download on your own, get it from the company’s official website. Stay away from third-party sites that might host <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malware</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>What to do if you think you’ve been scammed:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change your passwords.</strong> This will provide protection if the scammer was able to access your account passwords in some form. While this can be a big task, it’s a vital one. A <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> that’s part of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comprehensive online protection</a> can make it much easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Run a malware and virus scan right away.</strong> Delete files or apps that the software says is an issue. Do the same for other devices on your network too. Experienced and determined scammers can infect them as well by gaining access to one device on your network.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop payment.</strong> Contact your bank, credit card company, or online payment platform to reverse the charges. File a fraud complaint as well. The sooner you act, the better chance you have of recovering some or all your money. (Note that this is a good reason to use credit cards for online purchases, as they afford extra protection that debit cards and other payment services don&#8217;t.)</li>\n<li><strong>Report the scam.</strong> In the U.S., you can contact the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commission</a>, which reports the claim to thousands of law enforcement agencies. While they can&#8217;t resolve your individual issue, your report can help with broader investigations and build a case against scammers—which can make the internet safer for others. <a href=\"https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Their list of FAQs</a> is particularly helpful too, answering important questions like “how do I get my money back?”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/lookout-scam-tech-support-calls/\">Be on the Lookout for Scam Tech Support Calls</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How to Spot Fake News in Your Social Media Feed","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/spot-fake-news-and-misinformation-in-your-social-media-feed/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Wed, 16 Aug 2023 11:30:26 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"fake news"},{"#cdata-section":"misinformation"},{"#cdata-section":"fake information"},{"#cdata-section":"spot fake news"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=105598"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/300x200_Blog_081623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/300x200_Blog_081623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/300x200_Blog_081623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Spotting fake news in your feed has always been tough.

In recent years, we’ve seen fake news creators slap a new headline on a new photo, all to make it seem like it’s something current. Once again, a quick search can help you tell if it’s fake or not. Try a reverse image search and see what comes up. Is the photo indeed current? Who took it? When? Where?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Check your emotions too</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Has a news story you’ve read or watched ever made you shake your fist at the screen or want to clap and cheer? How about something that made you fearful or simply laugh? Bits of content that evoke strong emotional responses tend to spread quickly, whether they’re articles, a post, or even a tweet. That’s a ready sign that a quick fact check </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be in order. The content is clearly playing to your biases.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s a good reason for that. Bad actors who wish to foment unrest, unease, or spread disinformation use emotionally driven content to plant a seed. Whether or not their original story gets picked up and viewed firsthand doesn’t matter to these bad actors. Their aim is to get some manner of disinformation out into the ecosystem. They rely on others who will re-post, re-tweet, or otherwise pass it along on their behalf—to the point where the original source of the information gets completely lost. This is one instance where people readily begin to accept certain information as fact, even if it’s not factual at all.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Certainly, some legitimate articles will generate a response as well, yet it’s a good habit to do a quick fact check and confirm what you’ve read. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Expand your media diet</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A single information source or story won’t provide a complete picture. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> only cover a topic from a certain angle or narrow focus. Likewise, information sources are helmed by editors and stories are written by people—all of whom have their biases, whether overt or subtle. It’s for this reason that expanding your media diet to include a broad range of information sources is so important.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, see what other information sources have to say on the same topic. Consuming news across a spectrum will expose you to thoughts and coverage you might not otherwise get if you keep your consumption to a handful of sources. The result is that you’re more broadly informed and can </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">compare</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> different sources and points of view. Using the tips above, you can find other reputable sources to round out your media diet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Additionally, for a list of reputable information sources, along with the </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">reasons</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> they’re reputable, check out “</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">10 Journalism Brands Where You Find Real Facts Rather Than Alternative Facts</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">” published by </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Forbes</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and authored by an associate professor at The King’s College in New York City.

Advances in AI give images a clarity and crispness that they didn’t have before, deepfake videos play more smoothly, and voice cloning gets uncannily accurate. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet even with the best AI, scammers often leave their fingerprints all over the fake news content they create. Look for the following:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) Consider the context </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI fakes usually don’t appear by themselves. There’s often text or a larger article around them. Inspect the text for typos, poor grammar, and overall poor composition. Look to see if the text even makes sense. And like legitimate news articles, does it include identifying information—like date, time, and place of publication, along with the author’s name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Evaluate the claim</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does the image seem too bizarre to be real? Too good to be true? Today, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet,” now includes “Don’t believe everything you see on the internet.” If a fake news story is claiming to be real, search for the headline elsewhere. If it’s truly noteworthy, other known and reputable sites will report on the event—and have done their own fact-checking.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3) Check for distortions</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The bulk of AI technology still renders fingers and hands poorly.

So, if you invest a lot of real money into your characters, be especially vigilant and follow these five important tips to protect your online accounts. </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Do not reveal personal information</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s common for gamers to use variations of their real names and birthdates in their public-facing usernames. Doing this could reveal personal information that you’d rather keep private. Consider using a nickname or a combination of random numbers instead. Along this same vein, don’t reveal personal details about yourself (phone number, hometown, places you visit regularly, etc.) on chats or streams. Lurking cybercriminals can gather these personal details to impersonate you. </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Edit your privacy settings</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">On some online PC games, you can join campaigns with gamers from all over the world. While the interconnectivity is great, carefully vet who you allow to follow your online profile. If a stranger sends a friend request out of the blue, be on alert. They could have nefarious motives, such as phishing for valuable data. It’s best to customize your privacy settings to make your profile invisible to strangers.  </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Don’t pirate games or download cheat software</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Developers spend a lot of time creating amazing games, so make sure you purchase games legally and play them as they are intended. Research revealed that cracked versions – or unauthorized versions – of popular games sometimes hid ChromeLoader malware, which has the ability to steal credentials stored in internet browsers.

And they can also be scams.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the U.S., unwanted calls rank as the top consumer complaint reported to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Partly because scammers have made good use of spoofing technologies that serve up phony caller ID numbers. As a result, that innocent-looking phone number </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> not be innocent at all. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whether the voice on the other end of the smartphone is recorded or an actual person, the intent behind the call is likely the same—to scam you out of your personal information, money, or both. Callers such as these </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> impersonate banks, government agencies, insurance companies, along with any number of other organizations. Anything that gives them an excuse to demand payment, financial information, or ID numbers. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And some of those callers can sound rather convincing. Others, well, they’ll just get downright aggressive or threatening. One of the most effective tools these scam calls use is a sense of urgency and fear, telling you that there’s a problem </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right now</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and they need your information </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">immediately</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to resolve whatever bogus issue they’ve come up with. That right there is a sign you should take pause and determine what’s really happening before responding or taking any action. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Avoid and stop robocalls with these tips </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whatever form these unwanted calls take, there are things you can do to protect yourself and even keep you from getting them in the first place. These tips will get you started: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) Don’t pick up—and if you do, don’t say “yes” </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This straightforward piece of advice can actually get a little tricky. We mentioned spoofing, and certain forms of it can get rather exact. Sophisticated spoofing can make a call appear to come from someone you know. Yet more run-of-the-mill spoofing will often use a form of “neighbor spoofing.” The scammers will use a local area code or the same prefix of your phone number to make it seem more familiar. In short, you might answer one of these calls by mistake. I</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">f</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you do answer, never say “yes.” </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Similarly</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sophisticated scammers will record </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a victim&#8217;s</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">voice</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for use in other scams. That can include trying to hack into credit card accounts by using the company’s phone tree. Recordings of slightly longer lengths can also lead to voice cloning using AI-driven tools.

Good chance they got it from a data broker site. Data brokers collect and sell personal information of thousands and even millions of individuals. They gather them from public sources, public records, and from third parties as well—like data gathered from smartphone apps and shopping habits from supermarket club cards. And for certain, phone numbers are often in that mix. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b5e00ee9de7241e67e32595250a0d373bd2a4c6d4aecc8a98d5e81475d3de94e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our Personal Data Cleanup can help.</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> It scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info.

While these apps can indeed block spam calls, they might have privacy issues. Which is ironic when you’re basically trying to protect your privacy with these apps in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These apps might collect information, such as your contact list, usage data, and other information about your phone. As with any app, the key resides in the user agreement. It should tell you what information the app might collect and why. It should also tell you if this information is shared with or sold to third parties. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What’s at risk?

They’ll dupe the victim’s friends and followers with scams. They’ll flood feeds with misinformation. And they’ll steal all kinds of personal information—not to mention photos and chats in DMs. In all, a stolen social media account could lead to fraud, blackmail, and other crimes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet you have a strong line of defense that can prevent it from happening to you: multi-factor authentication (MFA).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">MFA goes by other names, such as two-factor authentication and two-step verification. Yet they all boost your account security in much the same way. They add an extra step or steps to the login process. Extra evidence to prove that you are, in fact, you. It’s in addition to the usual username/password combination, thus the “multi-factor” in multi-factor authentication. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Examples of MFA include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sending a one-time code via a text or phone call, often seen when logging into bank and credit card accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sending a one-time code to an authentication app, such as when logging into a gaming service.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Asking for the answer to a security question, like the name of your elementary school or the model of your first car.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Biometric information, like a fingerprint or facial scan.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With MFA, a hacker needs more than just your username and password to weasel their way into your account.

Lost cellphones and laptops are not only expensive to replace but you lose control of the valuable </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Ftake-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (PII) they contain. Protect all devices with unique, hard-to-guess passwords. Even better, enable biometric passwords, such as fingerprint or face ID. These are the hardest passwords to crack and can keep the information inside lost or stolen devices safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Don’t Share Passwords</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Streaming services host the most buzzworthy shows. All their friends may be raving about the latest episodes of a zombie thriller or sci-fi visual masterpiece, but alas: Your family doesn’t have a subscription to the streaming service. Cash-conscious college students especially may attempt to save money on streaming by sharing passwords to various platforms. Alert your children to the dangers of doing so. Sharing a password with a trusted best friend might not seem like a cyberthreat, but if they share it with a friend who then shares it with someone else who may not be so trustworthy, you just handed the keys to a criminal to walk right in and help themselves to your PII stored on the streaming service’s dashboard.    </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once the cybercriminal has your streaming service password, they may then attempt to use it to break into other sensitive online accounts. Criminals bank on people reusing the same passwords across various accounts. So, make sure that your children always keep their passwords to themselves and have unique passwords for every account. If they’re having a difficult time remembering dozens of passwords, sign them up for a password manager that can store passwords securely.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Keep Some Details a Mystery on Social Media</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Walk down any city or suburban street, and you’re likely to see at least one Gen Zer filming themselves doing the latest dance trend or taking carefully posed pictures with their friends to share on social media. According to one survey, 76% of Gen Zers use Instagram and 71% are on social media for three hours or more every day.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> And while they’re on social media, your children are likely posting details about their day. Some details – like what they ate for breakfast – are innocent. But when kids start posting pictures or details about where they go to school, where they practice sports, and geotagging their home addresses, this opens them up to identity fraud or stalking. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Encourage your children to keep some personal details to themselves, especially their full names, full birthdates, address, and where they go to school. For their social media handles, suggest they go by a nickname and omit their birthyear. Also, it’s best practice to keep social media accounts set to private. If they have aspirations to become the internet’s next biggest influencer or video star, they can create a public account that’s sparse on the personal details.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Say No to Cyberbullying</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cyberbullying is a major concern for school-age children and their parents. According to McAfee’s “</span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fconsumer%2Fen-us%2Fdocs%2Freports%2Frp-connected-family-study-2022-global.pdf%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Life Behind the Screens of Parents, Tweens, and Teens</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">,” 57% of parents worry about cyberbullying and 47% of children are similarly uneasy about it.

Breaks from social media platforms are healthy, so consider having the whole family join in on a family-wide social media vacation. Instead of everyone scrolling on their phones on a weeknight, replace that time with a game night instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

Now, instead of spending hours writing essays, students can ask artificial intelligence to compose it for them. ChatGPT is just the latest tool corner-cutters are adding to their toolbelt. Now that most kids, tweens, and teens have cellphones in their pockets, that means they also basically have cheating devices under their desks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To deter cheating, parents should consider lessening the pressure upon their kids to receive a good grade at any cost. School is all about learning, and the more a student cheats, the less they learn. Lessons often build off previous units, so if a student cheats on one test, future learning is built upon a shaky foundation of previous knowledge. Also, students should be careful about using AI as a background research tool, as it isn’t always accurate.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

While it used to be as simple as limiting TV time, they now deal with monitoring many forms of technology. From eyes glued to smartphones all day to hours spent playing video games, kids are immersed in technology.</p>\n<p>Safe technology use doesn’t come as second nature — it needs to be taught. As a parent, the issues of when to get your child a phone, too much screen time and online harassment are top of mind. To address these concerns, it’s important to set boundaries and teach safe technology use. One way to do this is by creating a family media agreement or contract.</p>\n<p>Family device agreements help teach proper technology use and set expectations. They allow you to start an open conversation with your kids and encourage them to be part of the decision making. By creating a family device agreement, your kids will know their boundaries and have concrete consequences for breaking them.</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In today&#8217;s parenting, you may want to consider creating a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/McAfeeDeviceAgreement.pdf\">McAfee Family Device Agreement</a>. The most important thing is to have an agreement that is suitable for your kids’ ages and maturity and one that works for your family’s schedule. There’s no point making your kids sign an agreement that limits their time on Instagram when they’re probably quite happy visiting only the online sites that you have ‘bookmarked’ for them. </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gear Up for a Safe School Year</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While diligence and good cyber habits can lessen the impact of many of these 10 threats, a cybersecurity protection service gives parents and their students valuable peace of mind that their devices and online privacy are safe. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+ Ultimate Family Plan</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is the all-in-one device, privacy, and identity protection service that allows the whole family to live confidently online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Morning Consult, “</span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmorningconsult.com.mcas.ms%2F2022%2F12%2F12%2Fgen-z-social-media-usage%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gen Z Is Extremely Online</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/10-back-to-school-tech-tips-for-kids-teens-and-college-students/\">10 Back-to-School Tech Tips for Kids, Teens and College Students</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Season of Back to School Scams","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/the-season-of-back-to-school-scams/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"pubDate":"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 19:26:50 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=172177"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Authored by: Lakshya Mathur and Yashvi Shah  As the Back-to-School season approaches, scammers are taking advantage of the opportunity to...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/the-season-of-back-to-school-scams/\">The Season of Back to School Scams</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>Authored by: <span class=\"TextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Subtitle\">Lakshya Mathur</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Subtitle\"> and Yashvi Shah</span></span><span class=\"EOP SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As the Back-to-School season approaches, scammers are taking advantage of the opportunity to deceive parents and students with various scams.

Scrolling through your social media feed and breaking news sites, all the mentions of artificial intelligence and its uses makes the online world feel like a lawless free-for-all. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While your school or workplace may have rules against using AI for projects, as of yet there are very few laws regulating the usage of mainstream AI content generation tools. As the technology advances are laws likely to follow? Let’s explore.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What AI Laws Exist?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As of August 2023, there are no specific laws in the United States governing the general public’s usage of AI. For example, there are no explicit laws banning someone from making a </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fai-in-the-hands-of-cybercriminals-how-to-spot-fake-art-and-deepfakes%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">deepfake</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> of a celebrity and posting it online. However, if a judge could construe the deepfake as defamation or if it was used as part of a scam, it could land the creator in hot water.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The White House issued a draft of an artificial intelligence bill of rights that outlines best practices for AI technologists. This document isn’t a law, though. It&#8217;s more of a list of suggestions to urge developers to make AI unbiased, as accurate as possible, and to not completely rely on AI when a human could perform the same job equally well.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The European Union is in the process of drafting the EU AI Act. Similar to the American AI Bill of Rights, the EU’s act is mostly directed toward the developers responsible for calibrating and advancing AI technology.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">China is one country that has formal regulations on the use of AI, specifically deepfake. A new law states that a person must give express consent to allow their faces to be used in a deepfake. Additionally, the law bans citizens from using deepfake to create fake news reports or content that could negatively affect the economy, national security, or China’s reputation. Finally, all deepfakes must include a disclaimer announcing that the content was synthesized.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">3</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Should AI Laws Exist in the Future?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As scammers, edgy content creators, and money-conscious executives push the envelope with deepfake, AI art, and text-generation tools, laws governing AI use may be key to stopping the spread of fake news and protect people’s livelihoods and reputations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Deepfake challenges the notion that “seeing is believing.” Fake news reports can be dangerous to society when they encourage unrest or spark widespread outrage. Without treading upon the freedom of speech, is there a way for the U.S. and other countries to regulate deepfake creators with intentions of spreading dissent? China’s mandate that deepfake content must include a disclaimer could be a good starting point.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) strikes are a prime example of how unbridled AI use could turn invasive and impact people’s jobs. In their new contract negotiations, each union included an AI clause. For the writers, they’re asking that AI-generated text not be allowed to write “literary material.” Actors are arguing against the widespread use of AI-replication of actors’ voices and faces. While deepfake could save (already rich) studios millions, these types of recreations could put actors out of work and would allow the studio to use the actors’ likeness in perpetuity without the actors’ consent.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">4</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Future laws around the use of AI will likely include clauses about consent and assuming the risk text generators introduce to any project.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Use AI Responsibly</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the meantime, while the world awaits more guidelines and firm regulations governing mainstream AI tools, the best way you can interact with </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fpros-and-cons-of-ai-in-daily-life%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">AI in daily life</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> is to do so responsibly and in moderation.

The World Wide Web (WWW) has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and explore, becoming an integral part of our daily lives. With the importance of the internet only growing stronger, it&#8217;s only fitting to honor the World Wide Web with a special day of commemoration. But with the internet comes risks, and it’s important to make sure your family is protected from potential threats. Here are some tips and tricks to keep your family safe online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Phishing Scam Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing scams are a type of fraud that involves sending emails or other messages that appear to be from a legitimate source. The goal of these messages is to trick users into providing personal information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and bank account details. To protect against phishing scams, teach your family to: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Be suspicious of any emails or messages that look suspicious, even if they appear to come from a legitimate source.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Verify the source of any email or message before responding.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Never provide any personal information in response to an email or message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Identity Scam Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Identity theft is a crime in which someone uses another person’s personal information to commit fraud or other crimes. Teach your family to protect against identity theft by: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Being aware of what personal information they share online.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Using secure passwords for all accounts.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Regularly monitoring their credit reports.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. VPN Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A virtual private network (VPN) is a type of technology that provides a secure connection to a private network over the internet. A VPN can help protect your family’s online activity by encrypting the data and hiding your online activity from others. To ensure your family’s online safety, teach them to: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Use a reliable VPN service.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Always connect to a VPN when accessing public Wi-Fi networks.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Be aware of the country or region in which their VPN service is located.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Password Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strong passwords are an important part of online security. Teach your family to create strong passwords and to never share them with anyone. Additionally, use a password manager to store and manage your family’s passwords. A password manager can help by: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Generating secure passwords.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Encrypting and storing passwords in a secure, central location.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Automatically filling in passwords on websites.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To conclude, celebrations on World Wide Web Day allow us to give thanks for the incredible world of knowledge, commerce, entertainment, communication, and innovation that the internet has provided, and continues to provide for us all. By following these tips and tricks, your family can stay safe online and enjoy all the benefits of the internet.

From the ability to catch up with friends and family across the globe to finding information about virtually any topic, the power of the internet is remarkable. In fact, the World Wide Web has significantly enriched our lives in countless ways.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Did you know that the first-ever image posted on the World Wide Web was a photo of Les Horribles Cernettes, a parody pop band founded by employees at CERN? It was uploaded in 1992 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who used a NeXT computer as the first-ever web server. And although we use the term &#8220;surfing the net&#8221; regularly, do you know who actually coined the phrase? A librarian by the name of Jean Armour Polly wrote an article titled &#8220;Surfing the Internet&#8221; in the Wilson Library Bulletin at the University of Minnesota in 1992.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are many other remarkable facts about the World Wide Web, including its growth over the years. By the start of the year 1993, there were only 50 servers worldwide, but that number had grown to over 500 by October of the same year. Advances in data compression enabled media streaming to happen over the web, which was previously impractical due to high bandwidth requirements for uncompressed media. Although the number of websites online was still small in comparison to today&#8217;s figure, notable sites such as Yahoo! Directory and Yahoo! Search were launched in 1994 and 1995, respectively, marking the beginning of web commerce.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On World Wide Web Day, you can celebrate by exploring the capabilities of the internet and discovering how it has changed over the years. Many organizations worldwide host events featuring conversations and interviews with technology leaders, entrepreneurs, and creators. There are also different talks, activities, and discussions online that you can join, allowing you to delve deeper into the history and potential of the World Wide Web. You could even consider running an event at your local business to market the day and celebrate what WWW has done for us all!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/world-wide-web-day-how-to-protect-your-family-online/\">World Wide Web Day: How to Protect Your Family Online</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"AI in the Wild: Malicious Applications of Mainstream AI Tools","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/ai-in-the-wild-malicious-applications-of-mainstream-ai-tools/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 08:46:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"ransomware"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"deepfakes"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=171872"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>It’s not all funny limericks, bizarre portraits, and hilarious viral skits.

In Arizona, a fake kidnapping phone call caused several minutes of panic for one family, as a mother received a demand for ransom to release her alleged kidnapped daughter. On the phone, the mother heard a voice that sounded exactly like her child’s, but it turned out to be an AI-generated facsimile.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In reality, the daughter was not kidnapped.

Do your best to really listen to the “voice” of your loved one. AI voice technology is incredible, but there are still some kinks in the technology. For example, does the voice have unnatural hitches? Do words cut off just a little too early? Does the tone of certain words not quite match your loved one’s accent? To pick up on these small details, a level head is necessary.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What you can do as a family today to avoid falling for an AI vishing scam is to agree on a family password. This can be an obscure word or phrase that is meaningful to you. Keep this password to yourselves and never post about it on social media. This way, if a scammer ever calls you claiming to have or be a family member, this password could determine a fake emergency from a real one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2.

Before buying anything or investing your money with a business you found through an advertisement, conduct your own background research on the company.

For example, if a criminal asked ChatGPT to write a key-logging malware, it would refuse. But if they rephrased and asked it to compose code that captures keystrokes, it may comply with that request. One researcher demonstrated that even someone with little knowledge of coding could use ChatGPT, thus making malware creation simpler and more available than ever.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">4</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Similarly, AI text generation tools can create convincing phishing emails and create them quickly.

Yet that’s what spyware effectively does while you’re online. Luckily, you can do plenty to keep spyware from winding up on your devices.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is Spyware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spyware secretly gathers information on you as you use your device. It’s a type of malware. Depending on its form, spyware can sniff out your surfing habits to serve up targeted ads—or it can record your keystrokes, which can steal your passwords and credit card numbers. In all, spyware skims your otherwise personal information and puts it into someone else’s hands.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spyware can end up on your device several ways. That includes clicking on a malicious attachment in an email, a download from a sketchy site, or via an app that you’ve downloaded yourself. Other sources of spyware include pirated video streams, illicit sharing sites (music, videos, games), and sketchy links passed along in social media and texts. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, bad actors simply install it on devices themselves if the device is unlocked and unattended.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can find spyware out there in the wild as well. Shared computers at hotels, libraries, and other public locations sometimes wind up with spyware on them. Hackers target these devices in the hopes that unsuspecting users will use them to go online and do a little banking or access otherwise sensitive information. That’s one more good reason to do your important business on your own trusted devices.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What are the Different Kinds of Spyware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Broadly speaking, spyware spans a range of uses. They can land anywhere from legitimate to questionable to outright illegal. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, some applications make it quite clear that they collect and share some usage data. Social media apps are a good example of this. While you might or might not be entirely comfortable with the data they collect, it’s legitimate. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other applications might not make their data collection policies clear, such as burying them in a user agreement—making it difficult for people to know what’s actually being collected. In other words, some app developers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> shroud just how much information and data they track.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Lastly, hackers and scammers will maliciously steal information, potentially with an app or by otherwise getting it installed on a victim’s device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Within this range of legitimate and illegal use, you’ll find different forms of spyware:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Adware</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> – As the name suggests, this form of spyware tracks user activity and sends it along to advertisers for targeted ad campaigns. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, this can take malicious forms that serve pop-up ads, which earn scammers money each time they get viewed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keyloggers and monitors</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> – These forms of spyware lurk in the background on devices and skim keystrokes as mentioned </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">above.

Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.

Increasingly, hackers and scammers go to great pains when they create their malicious websites. They take extra steps to make their sites look legit, when in fact </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">they&#8217;re</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> anything but. Certainly, plenty of other hackers and scammers slap together malicious sites that still look a bit roughshod, which makes them easier to spot.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So whether it’s a clever knockoff or a slapdash effort, unsafe websites of all kinds have several telltale signs you can spot. We’ll show you, and let’s start things off with what makes an unsafe website unsafe in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What’s an unsafe website?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Unsafe websites typically harbor one of two primary forms of attack—yet sometimes both:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Malware:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Hackers will use their sites to install malware on your device, often by tricking you into clicking or tapping on a download. They might tempt you with an offer, a prize, a show to stream—just about anything you might want to otherwise download. (Recently, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fscammers-love-barbie-fake-videos-promote-bogus-ticket-offers-that-steal-personal-info%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">we saw hackers installing malware on sites that offered to stream dubbed versions of the “Barbie” movie</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Another classic attack. Phishing involves scammers who try to hoodwink you into providing account or financial information. Common ruses include links in emails, texts, and DMs that appear to be urgent messages from streaming services, banks, social media, and other accounts. Of course, those messages are phony. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As a result, unsafe websites can lead to some not-so-good things.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What can happen if you visit an unsafe website?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On the malware side, attackers can install spyware and similar apps that siphon financial and personal information from your device while you’re using it. Other malware might steal files outright or maliciously delete them altogether. Ransomware remains a major concern today as well, where attackers hold devices and data hostage. And even if victims end up paying the ransom, they have no guarantee that the attacker will free their device or data.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing attacks often lead to financial headaches, sometimes large ones at that. It depends on the information scammers get their hands on. In some cases, the damage might lead to identity fraud and a few illicit charges on a debit or credit card. If scammers gather enough information, they can take that a step further and commit identity theft. That can include opening new credit or loans in your name. It could also give a scammer the info they need to get driver’s licenses or employment in your name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Above and beyond committing fraud or theft on their own, scammers might also sell stolen information to others on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Again, all not-so-good. Yet quite preventable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to tell if a website is safe or unsafe.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For some sites, it only takes one sign. For other sites, it takes a few signs—a series of red flags that warn you a site is unsafe. When you’re online, keep a sharp eye out for the following:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site uses HTTP rather than HTTPS.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The “s” stands for “secure.” Specifically, it means that the website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser. SSL helps prevent others from intercepting and reading your sensitive information as it’s transmitted, which is particularly important when you shop or bank online. Likewise, you can also look for a little lock symbol in the address bar of your web browser. That’s one more way you can spot a site that uses SSL.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site has a combination of typos and poor design.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">From spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, to stretched out logos and cheap photography, some unsafe websites are designed poorly. Legitimate businesses pride themselves on error-free and professional-looking sites. If a website looks like it got cobbled together in a hurry or doesn’t seem to be well-designed, that’s usually a red flag. The site might be unsafe, created by attackers who don’t have a strong attention to detail—or the creative capabilities to create a good-looking website in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The web address looks altered or off.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Plenty of unsafe sites are imposter sites. They’ll try to pass themselves off as a legitimate company, like the streaming services, banks, and so forth that we mentioned earlier—all to get a hold of your account information. With all these imposter sites in play, look at the site’s address. Scammers will gin up web addresses that are close to but different from legitimate sites, so close that you might miss it. If you’re uncertain about the address, leave the page. Also note that many companies have web pages that provide lists of the official addresses that they use. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com.mcas.ms%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%3FnodeId%3DG4YFYCCNUSENA23B%26McasTsid%3D20892%23%3A~%3Atext%3DNote%253A%2520Legitimate%2520Amazon%2520websites%2520have%2C789.123%252Famazon.com%252F.&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Amazon</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> provides on example, and we do the same here at </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fcyber-scam%2Fcustomer-scam-awareness.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Or maybe it says that your system isn’t current. Either way, there’s a file the site wants you to download. “You can correct the issue with a click!” Don’t. It’s a classic trick. Instead of fixing your non-existent problem, the download will create one.

So much so, it’s often the subject of sitcom bits. Needless to say, the attackers behind these sites want you to click for one of several reasons. It might be to get you to download malware. It might be to generate ad revenue with clicks. Or it might be to get you to click a link that redirects you to another malicious site. In all, if you encounter a site like this, close your browser. And then run a system scan with your online protection software.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site offers hard-to-get items at an outrageous discount.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These unsafe sites sprout up around </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the holidays</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and gift-giving seasons. When stores run low on particularly popular or hot items, scammers will quickly launch sites that claim these items are in stock and ready to ship. Similarly, they might promote popular items at a deep discount. Of course, shopping at these sites will likely lead to one thing—a credit card charge and no item on your doorstep. Be wary when you see ads for stores in your social media feed, in search, and elsewhere. Stick with known, trusted retailers.

When popular movies hit the big screen or major sporting events come around, so do scam sites that promise to stream them for free or at </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a low</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> cost. Avoid them. T</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">rusted streamers will only carry shows and events that they have the rights to. If you find an offer to stream something that’s heavily discounted, free, or not available on known media outlets, it’s likely a scam. At the very least, it might serve up pirated content, which could carry malware threats along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site promotes prizes, coupons, or a quiz.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not every site that promotes some kind of giveaway or deal is a scam. Yet the ones that ask for personal or financial information likely are. Scammers prey on people’s love for saving money or even winning a buck or two. Enter the prize, coupon, and quiz sites. Malicious prize and coupon sites will often ask for credit or debit card information, often under the guise of a payout or a discount. Malicious quiz sites will likewise ask for all kinds of personal information, typically questions about the name of your pet, the first car you owned, or where you went to school. The questions share much in common with the security questions used by banks and credit card companies. Handing this information over could lead to a breached account. Give these sites a pass.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be extra confident—let online protection determine if that site is safe for you.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive online protection software like ours</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes web protection that can spot malicious sites for you.

To live in a time where we can access this amazing technology from the smartphones in our pockets is a privilege; however, overusing AI or using it irresponsibly could cause a chain reaction that not only affects you but your close circle and society beyond.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Here are four tips to help you navigate and use AI responsibly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Always Double Check AI’s Work</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Artificial intelligence certainly earns the “intelligence” part of its name, but that doesn’t mean it never makes mistakes. Make sure to proofread or review everything AI creates, be it written, visual, or audio content. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For instance, if you’re seeking a realistic image or video, AI often adds extra fingers and distorts faces. Some of its creations can be downright nightmarish! Also, there’s a phenomenon known as an AI hallucination. This occurs when the AI doesn’t admit that it doesn’t know the answer to your question. Instead, it makes up information that is untrue and even fabricates fake sources to back up its claims.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">One AI hallucination landed a lawyer in big trouble in New York. The lawyer used ChatGPT to write a brief, but he didn’t double check the AI’s work. It turns out the majority of the brief was incorrect.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Whether you’re a blogger with thousands of readers or you ask AI to write a little blurb to share amongst your friends or coworkers, it is imperative to edit everything that an AI tool generates. Not doing so could start a rumor based on a completely false claim.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Be Transparent</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you use AI to do more than gather a few rough ideas, you should cite the tool you used as a source. Passing off an AI’s work as your own could be considered cheating in the eyes of teachers, bosses, or critics. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There’s a lot of debate about whether AI has a place in the art world. One artist entered an image to a photography contest that he secretly created with AI. When his submission won the contest, the photographer revealed AI’s role in the image and gave up his prize. The photographer intentionally kept AI out of the conversation to prove a point, but imagine if he kept the image’s origin to himself.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Would that be fair?

Moreover, trusted streamers will only carry shows and events that they have the rights to. If you find an offer to stream something that’s heavily discounted, free, or not available on known media outlets, it’s likely a scam.

They use a phone’s permission settings to spy on its user by accessing the phone’s camera, microphone, and more.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">At the heart of any smartphone app you’ll find permissions, which allow apps to use certain features of your phone. A messaging app might ask for access to your camera and microphone to send video and voice messages. It might ask for permission to access your photos if you want to send pictures. Likewise, a navigation or rideshare app will ask for permission to access your phone’s location services.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">In short, permissions make apps work. And broadly speaking, most apps out there are legitimate. Yet what about a game that asks for permissions to access your contact list? Or a flashlight app that wants to use your microphone? How about a run-of-the-mill wallpaper app that wants to know your location? These are all examples of invasive apps. And the creators behind them want your personal information and to invade your privacy as well.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Luckily, invasive apps are easy to spot. And remove.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Invasive apps and mobile spyware</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Both invasive apps and mobile spyware snoop on you and your phone, yet invasive apps work differently than <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fmobile-spyware-how-you-can-keep-stalkers-off-your-phone%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fmobile-spyware-how-you-can-keep-stalkers-off-your-phone%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">mobile spyware</a>. Invasive apps use a phone’s built-in functionality to spy and gather information on you. Spyware is malware that can maliciously steal information by working secretly in the background. This can make an invasive app much easier to spot because it asks for broad permissions—permissions it doesn’t need to work.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Invasive apps might ask for permission to:</div>\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\" data-border=\"0\">\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Use your camera.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Access your microphone.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Track your location.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Access and modify your contacts.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Read your calendar.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Requests for permissions such as these aren’t a sign of an invasive app in and of themselves. Some apps require them to work. The telltale sign of an invasive app is when the app asks for permissions it doesn’t need. Think like the flashlight app that wants access to your microphone.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">The tricky bit with invasive apps is that many people quickly click through the user agreements and permission screens when they get a new app. Sometimes without reading carefully. That can particularly be the case with children grabbing a new app.<br />\nHowever, it’s never too late to spot an invasive app. And remove it.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Understanding, and controlling, permissions on your phone</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">With a quick trip to your phone’s settings, you can spot and remove invasive apps.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">On an iOS device …</b></div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, then tap Safety Check.<br />\nHere you can see which apps use the permissions you granted them and make changes to those permissions as needed.You can also run an App Privacy Report, which records data and sensor access on an app-by-app level. Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, then tap App Privacy Report. You can adjust your permissions from there as well.</div>\n<h3 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">On an Android device …</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">On your device, open the Settings app.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Tap <b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Apps</b>. Tap the app you want to change. If you can&#8217;t find it, tap See all apps. Then, select your app. Tap <b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Permissions</b>. If you allowed or denied any permissions for the app, you’ll find them here. To change the permission setting, tap it, then select Allow or Don&#8217;t allow.<br />\nFor location, camera, and microphone permissions, you might be able to select:</div>\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\" data-border=\"0\">\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">All the time: For location only. The app can use the permission at any time, even when you’re not using the app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Allow only while using the app: The app can use the permission only when you&#8217;re using that app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Ask every time: Every time you open the app, it&#8217;ll ask to use the permission. It can use the permission until you’re done with the app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Don&#8217;t allow: The app can&#8217;t use the permission, even when you’re using the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Invasive app? You might just want to delete it.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Rather than pare back permissions on an invasive app, your best and safest bet is to delete the app altogether. Even with excessive permissions turned off, the app might collect other information and send it to the company who developed it. Further, they might share it with others. In short, an invasive app is a bad app all around. Get rid of it and go with something legitimate.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">More ways to keep invasive apps off your phone</b></h2>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">1. Update your phone’s operating system.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Along with installing security software, keeping your phone’s operating system up to date can greatly improve your security. Updates can fix vulnerabilities that hackers rely on to pull off their malware-based attacks. It’s another tried-and-true method of keeping yourself safe—and for keeping your phone running great too.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">2. Avoid third-party app stores.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Google Play and Apple’s App Store have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure. Third-party sites might very well not, and they might intentionally host malicious apps as part of a front. Further, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps from their stores when discovered, making shopping there safer still.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">3. Review apps carefully.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Check out the developer—have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps might have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They might be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.</div>\n<h4><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">4. Go with a strong recommendation.</b></h4>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Yet better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors themselves. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">5. Protect your phone.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Comprehensive online protection software</a> can secure your phone in the same ways that it secures your laptops and computers. Installing it can protect your privacy, keep you safe from attacks on public Wi-Fi, and automatically block unsafe websites and links, just to name a few things it can do.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Be stingy with your apps and their permissions</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Permissions make for powerful apps that can help you hail a ride, get a pizza delivered to your door, and map your afternoon run. In the wrong hands, they can also snoop on your activities. If an app ever feels like it’s asking for too many permissions to do its job, you might have an invasive app on your hands.<br />\nYet the trick is that some invasive apps still slip through and end up on our phones. Quickly accepting terms and permissions is one reason. For extra protection, consider running a quick app audit. Check the apps and permissions on your phone as noted above and delete any suspicious apps.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Be stingy when it comes to giving your permission. Roll back the permissions so that the app works with the bare minimum of permissions. Set location services so that they’re only used when the app is in use. With social and messaging apps, select which photos you allow them to share rather than giving the app blanket access to your entire photo library.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">And lastly, if an app seems like it’s asking for too much, it probably is. Avoid it altogether.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/mobile-spyware/\">Mobile Spyware: How Hackers Can Turn Your Phone Into a Stalking Machine</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Sharing Isn’t Always Caring: Tips to Help Protect Your Online Privacy","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/sharing-isnt-always-caring-tips-to-help-protect-your-online-privacy/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jasdev Dhaliwal"},"pubDate":"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 19:10:29 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"internet safety"},{"#cdata-section":"Online Privacy"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=171512"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>When it comes to protecting your privacy, take a close look at your social media use—because sharing can quickly turn...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/sharing-isnt-always-caring-tips-to-help-protect-your-online-privacy/\">Sharing Isn’t Always Caring: Tips to Help Protect Your Online Privacy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071223-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When it comes to protecting your privacy, take a close look at your social media use—because sharing can quickly turn into oversharing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The term “oversharing” carries several different definitions. Yet in our case here, oversharing means saying more than one should to more people than they should. Consider the audience you have across your social media profiles. Perhaps you have dozens, if not hundreds of friends and followers. All with various degrees of closeness and familiarity. Who among them can you absolutely trust with the information you share?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And you might be sharing more than you think. Posts have a way of saying more than one thing, like:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">“This is the pool at the rental home I’m staying at this week.

A snapshot of you joking around with a co-worker might reveal a glimpse of company information. Maybe because of what’s written on the whiteboard behind the two of you. And in one extreme example, there’s the case an assault on a pop star.

That combination is key to your privacy—and the privacy of others too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Three simple steps for protecting your privacy on social media</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) Be more selective with your settings</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting—not to mention your relationships and likes. Taking a “friends only” approach to your social media profiles can help protect your privacy, because </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">that gives</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> a possible scammer or stalker much less material to work with. Yet further, some platforms allow you to create sub-groups of friends and followers. With a quick review of your network, you can create a sub-group of your most trusted friends and restrict your posts to them as needed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be critical of the invitations you receive.

Closely review the pics you take and see if there’s any revealing information in the background. If so, you can crop it out (think notes on a whiteboard, reflections in a window, or revealing location info). Further, ask anyone you want to include in their post for their permission.

Today&#8217;s Gen AI’s evolved from the use of chatbots in the 1960s. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Now, as AI and related technologies like deep learning and machine learning have evolved, generative AI can answer prompts and create text, art, videos, and even simulate convincing human voices. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How Does Generative AI Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Think of generative AI as a sponge that desperately wants to delight the users who ask it questions.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">First, a gen AI model begins with a massive information deposit. Gen AI can soak up huge amounts of data. For instance, ChatGPT is trained on 300 billion words and hundreds of megabytes’ worth of facts through the year 2021.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The AI will remember every piece of information that is fed into it. Additionally, it will use those nuggets of knowledge to inform any answer it spits out. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, a generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm constantly competes with itself within the gen AI model. This means that the AI will try to outdo itself to produce an answer it believes is the most accurate. The more information and queries it answers, the “smarter” the AI becomes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Google’s content generation tool, Bard is a great way to illustrate generative AI in action. Bard is based on gen AI and large language models. It&#8217;s trained in all types of literature and when asked to write a short story, it does so by finding language patterns and composing by choosing words that most often follow the one preceding it. In a 60 Minutes segment, Bard composed an eloquent short story that nearly brought the presenter to tears, but its composition was an exercise in patterns, not a display of understanding human emotions.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">3</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> So, while the technology is certainly smart, it’s not exactly creative.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to Use Generative AI Responsibly</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The major debates surrounding generative AI usually deal with how to use gen AI-powered tools for good. For instance, ChatGPT can be an excellent outlining partner if you’re writing an essay or completing a task at work; however, it’s irresponsible and is considered cheating if a student or an employee submits ChatGPT-written content word for word as their own work.

Her teenager had convinced her to join a dating site, so she created a profile on a popular app. After a handful of dates fell flat, she found Scott (name also changed). He was charismatic, kind. “We had an instant connection,” according to Sarah. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They spent hours on the phone sharing their deepest secrets and even started imagining a future together. But after about three months, Scott fell on hard times. At first, he needed to borrow $400 to pay for airfare to visit a dying relative, which he paid back immediately. Over the next few months, the numbers grew to $1,000 for rent and $3,000 for a business venture. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Repayments for those loans never came, and before long, Sarah had loaned her new love over $8,500. When she pressed him for the money, Scott ghosted Sarah online, moved out of town, and she never saw him again. She didn’t share her story with many people. She didn’t report it. She was too embarrassed and humiliated and even became depressed following what she calls “the Scott scam.” Painfully, she lost her trust in others.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sarah isn’t alone.

Reported losses hit $1.3 billion with a median loss of $4,400. And with such statistics, those figures reflect only what was reported.

How many worldwide?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That’s the pain of online dating and romance scams.

They might begin on dating apps and sites, just like in Sarah’s case. Yet they can happen elsewhere and even pop out of the blue too. Scammers will prowl around </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">on</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> social media, texts, and online games by pinging potential victims with an unexpected introductory message—a sort of digital opening line. In fact, the FTC reports that 40% of online dating and romance scams began with a message on social media, versus only 19% on dating apps.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With the initial connection made, a chat begins, and a friendship (or more) blossoms from there. Along the way, the scammer will often rely on a mix of somewhat exotic yet believable storytelling to lure the victim in. Often, that will involve their job and where they’re working. Reports say that scammers will talk of being workers on an offshore oil rig, members of the military stationed overseas, doctors working with an international organization, or working in the sort of jobs that would prevent them from otherwise easily meeting up in person. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With the phony relationship established, the scammer starts asking for money. The FTC reports that they’ll ask for money for several bogus reasons, usually revolving around some sort of hardship where they need a “little help” so that they can pay: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For a plane ticket or other travel expenses. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For medical expenses. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Customs fees to retrieve something. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gambling debts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A visa or other official travel documents. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The list goes on, yet that’s the general gist.

The benefit of this route, for the scammer anyway, is that this is as good as forking over cash. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. The victim lacks the protections they have with other payment forms, such as a credit card that allows the holder to cancel or contest a charge. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way is through gift cards. Scammers of all stripes, not </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> romance scammers, like these because they effectively work like cash, whether it’s a gift card for a major online retailer or a chain of brick-and-mortar stores.

AI has existed in many forms for decades, but it’s only recently that AI-powered apps and tools are available in the pockets and homes of just about everyone.

And are they playing video games together? Comic impersonators can be hilariously accurate with their copycatting, but the voice track to this video is spot on. This series of videos, created by TikToker Voretecks, uses AI voice generation to mimic presidential voices and pit them against each other to bring joy to their viewers.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> In this case, AI-generated voices are mostly harmless, since the videos are in jest. Context clues make it obvious that the presidents didn’t gather to hunt rogue machines together.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI voice generation turns nefarious when it’s meant to trick people into thinking or acting a certain way. For example, an AI voiceover made it look like a candidate for Chicago mayor said something inflammatory that he never said.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Fake news is likely to skyrocket with the fierce 2024 election on the horizon. Social media sites, especially Twitter, are an effective avenue for political saboteurs to spread their lies far and wide to discredit their opponent.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, while it might not appear on your social media feed, scammers can use what you post on social media to impersonate your voice.

A responsible social media user will alert their audiences when the content they post is AI generated. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Again, deepfake and other AI-altered images become malicious when they cause social media viewers to think or act a certain way. Fake news outlets may portray a political candidate doing something embarrassing to sway voters. Or an AI-altered image of animals in need may tug at the heartstrings of social media users and cause them to donate to a fake fundraiser.

Vishing is another phishing tactic over the phone, though instead of a text, the scammer leaves voicemails.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the case of one coordinated smishing attack, cybercriminals not only impersonated financial institutions but collected PII on their targets ahead of time. The criminals then used these personal details – like old addresses and Social Security Numbers – to convince people that they were legitimate bank employees.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> But since when does a bank try to prove itself to the customer? Usually, it’s the other way around, where they’ll ask you to confirm your identity. Be wary of anyone who texts or calls you and has your PII. If you’re ever suspicious of a caller or texter claiming they’re a financial official, contact your bank through verified channels (chat, email, or phone) you find on the bank’s website to make sure. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers also keep up with current events and attempt to impersonate well-known companies that have a reason to reach out to their customers. This adds false legitimacy to their message. For example, in the summer of 2022, Rogers Communications, a Canadian telecommunications provider, experienced an extended loss of service and told customers they could expect a reimbursement. Smishers jumped on the opportunity and sent a barrage of fake texts requesting banking details in order to carry out the reimbursement.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> However, Rogers credited customers directly to their Rogers accounts.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3 Tips to Identify a Smisher </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you receive a suspicious text, go through these three steps to determine if you should follow up with the organization in question or simply delete and report the text.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Know your notification preferences</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Do you have text alerts enabled for your bank and utility accounts? If not, disregard any text claiming to be from those organizations. Companies will only contact you through the channels you have approved. Also, in the case of the Rogers smishing scheme, be aware of how a company plans to follow up with customers regarding reimbursements.

However, the tone is a good indicator of a scammer. If the tone of the text urges you to act quickly or proposes a dire consequence of ignoring the message, be on alert. While suspicious activity on your credit card is serious, your bank will likely reimburse you for charges you didn’t make, so you have time to check your bank account and see recent activities. Official correspondence from financial institutions will always be professional and will try to put you at ease, not make you panic.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Verify the phone number</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Whenever you get a text from someone you don’t know, it’s a good practice to do an internet search for the number to see with whom it’s associated. If it’s a legitimate number, it should appear on the first page of the search results and direct to an official bank webpage.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What to Do When You Receive a Fake SMS Alert </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Once you’ve identified a fake SMS alert, do not engage with it. Never click on any links in the message, as they can redirect you to risky sites or download malware to your device. Also, don’t reply to the text.

For example, they give fiduciaries (like an estate executor, trustee, or an agent under a power of attorney) the right to manage a person’s digital assets if they already have the right to manage a person’s tangible assets. Such laws continue to evolve, and they can vary from state to state here in the U.S.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With that in mind, nothing offered in this article is legal advice, nor should it be construed as such.

As mentioned above, some accounts you hold are licensed to you and you alone. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they will not transfer. Two of the biggest examples are social media and email accounts. This can have serious repercussions if you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">don&#8217;t</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> leave specific instructions as to how those accounts should be handled after your passing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, do you want your social media profiles to remain online as a memorial or do you want them simply shut down? Note that different social media platforms have different policies for handling the accounts of users who have passed away. For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com.mcas.ms%2Fhelp%2F1017717331640041%2Fabout-memorialized-accounts%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Facebook allows for creating memorialized accounts that allow friends and families to continue sharing memories</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Policies vary, so check with your social media platforms of choice for specifics.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, will your executor need access to your email account to handle the estate’s affairs? And what about access to online accounts for paying bills and then ultimately closing those accounts? In all, these are points of discussion to have with an experienced estate attorney who knows the law in your region.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other things to be aware of are that subscriptions to streaming accounts are likely non-transferrable as well. Often, eBooks and digital publications you own are only licensed to you as the sole owner and can’t be transferred. Check the agreements </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">linked</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with items like these and have a talk with your attorney about them to determine what can and can’t be done with them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Blogs and online communities</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another aspect of your digital legacy is your voice. If you’re a blogger or a participant in an online community, you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> wish for a fiduciary or family member to leave a farewell post. Additionally, in the case of a blog, you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> want to set up some means for your work to stay online or get archived in some manner. Again, you can work with your attorney to leave specific instructions.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Giving your executor access to your digital assets</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can’t pass assets along if an executor can’t get access to them. A real-life example shows why digital executorship is so vital. Consider the story of the woman who lost family photos after her husband passed away. He kept them in an online storage account to which she had no access. And sadly, the company wouldn’t grant her access after his passing. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is often the case with many online accounts and services. Legally speaking, the deceased might own the storage account and the media kept within it, yet the cloud storage company owns the servers on which that media is stored. Access by someone other than the deceased might constitute a breach of their privacy policy or user agreements.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One way you can avoid heartbreak like this is to discuss giving your executor access to your accounts. You can consider creating a list of accounts, usernames, and passwords in a sealed letter </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">with</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> instructions that outline your wishes. A sealed letter is important: a will is </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a public</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> record after you pass away. A separate, sealed letter is not, which makes it a safe place to pass along account information. Again, you can discuss an option such as this with your attorney.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Protecting your digital assets</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One thing you can do today that can protect your digital assets for the long haul is to use </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">comprehensive security protection</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

It’s the foundational technology that underpins cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), yet it has several other emerging applications as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In all, gaining a sense of how blockchain technology works will give you a further sense as to how it may eventually shape the way you go about your day.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Blockchain technology holds great potential because of the unique, decentralized way it handles data—which marks the first step in understanding how it works.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How blockchains work</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">An easy way to visualize how a blockchain works is with an old-fashioned ledger. Each ledger entry is a link in a “chain.” Within each chain is a unique identifier known as a hash and a block of data associated with it. Over time, chains get added, which updates the hash as new blocks of data are added to the chain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">A simplified example of a blockchain storing recipe instructions.

Dozens, hundreds, thousands, or more participants in the blockchain track and validate the transactions associated with it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Each blockchain</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> entry gets validated through consensus, where individual participants on a blockchain network must all “agree” that the data in each entry is correct. Participants in the blockchain network can arrive at consensus through several models, yet commonly they use cryptographic calculations to validate an update to the chain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In this way, blockchain technology removes the need for a central authority to oversee a transaction, such as a bank. Put </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">simply</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, blockchain gets rid of the </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">go-between</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. And it makes transactions more anonymous as a result.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Participants in a blockchain network receive a small amount of cryptocurrency per transaction as a reward for their efforts. Enter the notion of crypto mining, where some miners set up large-scale farms of powerful, specialized computers that participate in blockchain networks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Blockchains come in public and private forms. Public is just as it sounds, where anyone can participate in the blockchain. They can read, write, or validate data in the blockchain. Private blockchains are invite-only in nature and can establish rules about who can alter the blockchain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Many blockchain ledger entries record financial transactions associated with cryptocurrency. However, ledger entries can contain any type of data. One can just as easily store documents, images, log files, or other items in a blockchain. Even decentralized programs, also known as smart contracts, can be stored. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In all, there’s much more to blockchain technology than just cryptocurrency.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How are blockchains used?

Moreover, 45% manage security in an ad-hoc way. It’s understandable, given that business owners would rather invest time in growing their business rather than managing their security. However, this low prioritization puts the business at risk, which could result in those six-figure losses mentioned above.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The advent of remote work introduces further security issues as well.

Whether working from home or some other location like a café, these employees may not have proper cybersecurity protection in place.

Beyond the dollars involved, the costs can run yet deeper from there. Downtime in the wake of an attack hits the bottom line. The recovery efforts that follow do as well. Additionally, businesses can suffer reputational damage if an attack also affects its customers, clients, and partners. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, a shift has taken place. Cybercriminals still go after big businesses and major organizations, yet an increasing number of them go after businesses with revenues in the seven or even six figures. Poor security posture is one reason. Another is that even relatively amateur operations can wage attacks with “off-the-shelf” hacking tools found on the dark web. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In short, every business faces the risk of cybercrime today.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet with the right protection in place, you can avoid paying the price of cybercrime.

Here’s what you should know about location sharing and the effects it has on your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Benefits of Location Sharing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Location sharing is most beneficial when you’re unsure about new surroundings and want to let your loved ones know that you’re ok. For example, if you’re traveling by yourself, it may be a good idea to share the location of your smartphone with an emergency contact. That way, if circumstances cause you to deviate from your itinerary, your designated loved one can reach out and ensure your personal safety.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The key to sharing your location safely is to only allow your most trusted loved one to track the whereabouts of you and your connected device. Once you’re back on known territory, you may want to consider turning off all location services, since it presents a few security and privacy risks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Risks of Location Sharing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In just about every other case, you should definitely think twice about enabling location sharing on your smartphone.

When ad tracking is enabled on your phone, it allows online advertisers to collect your personal data that you add to your various online accounts to better predict what ads you might like.

That makes them easy to spot. If you know what you’re looking for.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to spot social engineering</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) You receive an urgent or threatening message.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">An overexcited or aggressive tone in an email, text, DM, or any kind of message you receive should put up a big red flag. Scammers use these scare tactics to get you to act without thinking things through first. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Common examples include imposter scams. The scammer will send a text or email that looks like it comes from someone you know. And they’ll say they’re in a jam of some sort, like their car has broken down in the middle of nowhere, or that they have a medical emergency and to go to urgent care. In many of these cases, scammers will quickly ask for money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another classic is the tax scam, where a scammer poses as a tax agent or representative. From there, they bully money out of their victims with threats of legal action or even arrest. Dealing with an actual tax issue might be uncomfortable, but a legitimate tax agent won’t threaten you like that.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2) You get an incredible offer.

Winnings you’ll never receive, of course. The scammer wants that information to raid your accounts and commit all kinds of identity theft. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Those great deals? The scammers might not ship them at all. They’ll drain your credit or debit card instead and leave you tapping your foot by your mailbox. Sometimes, the scammers might indeed ship you something after all—a knock-off item. One possibly made with child labor.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3) Something about that message looks odd.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers will often pose as people you know. That can include friends, family members, co-workers, bosses, vendors or clients at work, and so on. And when they do, something about the message you get will seem a bit strange.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For starters, the message might not sound like it came from them. What they say and how they say it seems off or out of character. It might include links or attachments you didn’t expect to get. Or the message might come to you via a DM sent from a “new” account they set up. In the workplace, you might get a message from your boss instructing you to pay someone a large sum from the company account. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">These are all signs that something scammy </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> be afoot. You’ll want to follow up with these people in person or with a quick phone call just to confirm. Reach them in any way other than by replying to the message you received.

There’s the chance their account was hacked.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Preventing social engineering con games</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">How do scammers know how to reach you in the first place? And how do they seem to know just enough about you to cook up a convincing story? Clever scammers have resources, and they’ll do their homework. You can give them far less to work with by taking the following steps.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Clean up your personal data online.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online data brokers hoard all kinds of personal information about individuals. And they’ll sell it to anyone. That includes scammers. Data brokers gather it from multiple sources, such as public records and third parties that have further information like browsing histories and shopping histories (think your supermarket club card). With that information, a scammer can sound quite convincing—like they know you in some way or where your interests lie. You can get this information removed so scammers can’t get their hands on it. Our </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info. It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and with select products, it can even manage the removal for you. ​</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Set your social media accounts to private.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Needless to say, social media says a lot about you and what you’re into. You already know that because you put a part of yourself out there with each post—not to mention a record of the groups, pages, and things that you follow or like. All this provides yet more grist for a scammer’s mill when it comes time for them to concoct their stories. Setting your accounts to private takes your posts out of the public eye, and the eye of potential scammers too. This can help reduce your risk of getting conned.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Confirm before you click. Better yet, type in addresses yourself.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers throw all kinds of bogus links at people in the hope they’ll click and wind up on their scammy websites. They’ll also send attachments loaded with malware—a payload that contains ransomware, spyware, or viruses. If you get a message about one of your accounts, a shipment, or anything that involves your personal or financial info, confirm the sender. Did the message come from a legitimate address or account? Or was the address spoofed or the account a fake? For example, some scammers create social media accounts to pose as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS doesn&#8217;t contact people through social media. If you have a concern about a message or account, visit the site in question by typing it in directly instead of clicking on the link in the message. Access your information from there or call their customer service line.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">4. Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The combination of these two things makes it tough for scammers to crack your accounts. Even if they somehow get hold of your password, they can’t get into your account without the multifactor authentication number (usually sent to your phone in some form). </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">A password manager as part of comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> can help you create and securely store those strong, unique passwords. Also, never give your authentication number to anyone after you receive it. Another common scammer trick is to masquerade as a customer service rep and ask you to send that number to them.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">5. Slow down. View messages skeptically.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This is the one piece of advice scammers don’t want you to have, let alone follow. They count on you getting caught up in the moment—the emotion of it all. Once again, emotions, urgency, and human nature are all key components in any social engineering con. The moment you stop and think about the message, what it’s asking of you, and the way it’s asking you for it, will often quickly let you know that something is not quite right. Follow up. A quick phone call or face-to-face chat can help you from getting conned.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/social-engineering-the-scammers-secret-weapon/\">Social Engineering—The Scammer’s Secret Weapon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Dangers of Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 11:44:17 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"artificial intelligence"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"dangers of AI"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=170872"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Over the decades, Hollywood has depicted artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple unsettling ways.

It’s constantly learning and forming new patterns. The more questions you ask it, the more data it collects and the “smarter” it gets. However, when you ask ChatGPT a question it doesn’t know the answer to, it doesn’t admit that it doesn’t know. Instead, it’ll make up an answer like a precocious schoolchild.

Dozens? Hundreds? You probably have more than you think, and deleting a bunch of them might be the right call. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You have two good </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">reasons</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: savings and security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Certainly, you have trusted accounts you use all the time, like the one with your bank and a few others with major retailers. Yet you probably have armloads of other accounts on top of those. Within that broader mix, you’ll find accounts for apps, streaming services, online publications, and for retailers where you made one-off purchases years ago.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sure, you still access some of them occasionally. Yet there are plenty of other accounts you don’t. And there might be some you’re still paying for too. Closing them down can certainly save you some money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet there’s a security </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">issue,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> too. The more online accounts you keep, the greater </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the exposure</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you have to data breaches. Each account will have varying degrees of personal and financial information </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">linked</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to it. And that means each one carries a varying degree of risk if it gets breached. Moreover, some sites and services protect data better than others, which adds another dimension of risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Closing old and particularly risky accounts can decrease the risk of your personal and financial information winding up in the hands of an identity thief. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And there’s one more reason why you might consider cleaning up your old accounts. Your privacy. Companies hold all kinds of personal information in their databases. If you’re not using an account anymore, why should a company have it?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With security and savings in mind, McAfee created Online Account Cleanup. It finds and requests the deletion of unused accounts and protects your personal data from data breaches as a result. Monthly scans across your online accounts shows a risk level for each account and helps you decide which ones to delete.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And now is certainly a good time to trim down those accounts—</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">about</span> <a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com.mcas.ms%2Fstatistics%2F1307426%2Fnumber-of-data-breaches-worldwide%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">half a </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">billion</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> data records were exposed worldwide</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> between 2020 and 2022.

Here are the cybersecurity awareness basics to instantly boost your safety and confidence in your online presence.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Update Your Software</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Software update notifications always seem to ping on the outskirts of your desktop and mobile device at the most inconvenient times. What’s more inconvenient though is having your device hacked. One easy tip to improve your cybersecurity is to update your device software whenever upgrades are available. Most software updates include security patches that smart teams have created to foil cybercriminals.

What also makes for an excellent password is one that’s unique. Reusing passwords can be just as risky as using “password123” or your pet’s name plus your birthday as a password. A reused password can put all your online accounts at risk, due to a practice called credential stuffing. Credential stuffing is a tactic where a cybercriminal attempts to input a stolen username and password combination in dozens of random websites to see which doors it opens. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remembering a different password for each of your online accounts is almost an impossible task.

Keep a keen eye on the news and your inbox for notifications about recent breaches. Quick action is necessary to protect your personal and financial information, which is why you should be aware of current events. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The moment you hear about a breach on the news or see an email from a company to its customers about an incident, change your account’s password and double check your account’s recent activity to ensure nothing is amiss. Then await further action communicated through official company correspondences and official channels.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercriminals aren’t above adding insult to injury and further scamming customers affected in breaches. Phishers may spam inboxes impersonating the company and sending malware-laden links they claim will reset your password. Continue to scrutinize your messages and keep an eye on the company’s official company website and verified social media accounts to ensure you&#8217;re getting company-approved advice. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7. Secure Every Home Device</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One great mantra to guide your cybersecurity habits is: If you connect it, protect it. This means that any device that links to the internet should have security measures in place to shield it from cybercriminals. Yes, this includes your smart TV, smart refrigerator, smart thermostat, and smart lightbulbs! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Compose a list of the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fmake-your-smart-home-a-secure-home-too-securing-your-iot-smart-home-devices%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">smart home devices</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you own. (You probably have more than you thought!) Then, make sure that every device is using a password you created, instead of the default password the device came with. Default passwords can be reused across an entire line of appliances. So, if a cybercriminal cracks the code on someone else’s smart washing machine, that could mean they could weasel their way into yours with the same password.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way to secure your connected home devices is by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This usually means enrolling your phone number or email address with the device and inputting one-time codes periodically to log into the connected device. 2FA is an excellent way to frustrate a cybercriminal, as it’s extremely difficult for them to bypass this security measure. It may add an extra 15 seconds to your login process, but the peace of mind is worth the minor inconvenience.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, encase your entire home network with a secure router, or the device that connects your home Wi-Fi network to the internet. Again, change the password from the factory setting. And if you decide to rename the network, have fun with it but leave your name and address out of the new name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">8. Lock Your Devices</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When flip phones arrived on the scene in the 1990s and early 2000s, the worst that happened when they went missing was that you lost a cache of your stored text messages and call history. Now, when you </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fwhere-did-i-leave-my-phone-protecting-your-phone-from-loss-and-theft%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">misplace or have your smartphone stolen</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, it can seem like your whole online life vanished. Mobile devices store a lot of our sensitive information, so that’s why it’s key to not only safeguard your accounts but the devices that house them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The best way to lock your device against anyone but yourself is to set up face or fingerprint ID. This makes it virtually impossible for a criminal to open your device. Also, passcode- or password-protect all your devices. It may seem like an inconvenience now, but your fingers will soon be able to glide across the keyboard or number pad fluently in just a few days, adding maybe an extra second to opening your device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way to safeguard your device and the important information within it is to disable your favorite internet browser from auto-filling your passwords and credit card information. In the hands of a criminal, these details could lead to significant losses. A password manager here comes in handy for quick and secure password and username inputting. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">9. Check Your Credit Regularly</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Credit experts recommend checking your credit at least once yearly, but there’s no harm in checking your credit score more often. It’s only hard inquiries (or credit checks initiated by lenders) that may lower your credit score. Consider making it a habit to check your credit once every quarter. The first signs of identity theft often appear in a drastically lower credit score, which means that someone may be opening lines of credit in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Also, if you’re not planning to apply for a new credit card or a loan anytime soon, why not lock your credit so no one can access it?

has become both a more regular and widely accepted part of our daily lives. But that doesn’t mean that we can take our eye off the ball. While there is a lot to love about gaming, there are still steps we should all take to ensure the experience is safe and positive for everyone, particularly our kids. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Yes, I’m talking about passwords again!! And here’s why – if you (or your kids) use the same password for each of your online accounts and one of those accounts get hacked, then you risk losing control of your entire digital life. Yes, I know it sounds dramatic but that is the reality. The easiest way of avoiding this scenario is by ensuring each of your online accounts, including your gaming accounts, has its own unique password. Now remember, passwords need to be at least 10 characters, have a combination of numbers, symbols and upper and lower-case letters and have no connection to anything about you at all. I’m a fan of a long, nonsensical sentence but, I’m an even bigger fan of a password manager that can both create and remember these unique passwords for you.

This adds another layer of security by adding an additional stage to the login process.

Where would the modern parent be without online banking? How did our non-digital forefathers ever cope??</p>\n<p>Online banking is just so convenient and basically a necessity of modern life. If you’ve recently tried to conduct a transaction at a branch, then you’ll know exactly what I mean. One of my boys recently tried to set up a new account at a local banking branch and they were told to come back the following day. Instead, we went home and did it online in less than 20 minutes!</p>\n<p>Aussie banks are world class at implementing a range of security measures to keep our banking safe however there are still things we can do to avoid our banking details getting into the hands of hackers. But many of us just assume that ‘all is well’ &#8211; our banking apps work seamlessly, so why do we need to worry? And that’s where many come unstuck. If it doesn’t appear to be broken, why do we need to fix it? Well, being ahead of the risks is how you keep yourself safe, my friends. So, here are my top tips to ensure all your family members are banking online in the securest way possible.</p>\n<h3>1. Ensure You Are Using Legit Banking Apps</h3>\n<p>If you’re changing banks or helping your child set up their online banking, it’s essential that you download your bank’s official app. Imitations do exist! Ideally, download the app from the bank’s website however if this isn’t an option use a genuine app store like Apple’s AppStore or Google Play for Android devices. And always verify the app is legitimate by checking the developer details and reading the reviews.</p>\n<p>Budgeting or financial management apps are an incredibly popular way to help manage finances, but you need to be cautious here too as many will require you to share your banking logins. Always check the app’s reviews, its history of data breaches and its security policies before you download.</p>\n<h3>2. Ensure your Passwords are Long, Strong and Unique</h3>\n<p>Using the name of your puppy, your kids or worse still, your birthday, is one of the fastest ways of getting your banking details into the hands of hackers. Passwords need to have no connection to any part of your life, should never be stored in your banking app or anywhere on your phone and NEVER, EVER written on the back of your debit card!! Here are my top tips:</p>\n<p>Make them long – choose a phrase instead of just 1 word. I love a nonsensical sentence with at least 10 characters.</p>\n<p>Always include lower and uppercase letters, a number or 2 and a few symbols.</p>\n<p>Every online account needs its own unique password – no exceptions.</p>\n<p>Put a reminder in your calendar to update your passwords regularly – at least every 3-6 months.</p>\n<p>All sounds too hard? Try a password manager that will not only create complex passwords that no human could ever think of, but it will also remember then for you.

Say No to Public Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>Geez, public Wi-Fi is convenient, particularly if you are travelling. But, using it to undertake any banking or financial dealings is just too risky in, my opinion. Why? I hear you ask. Well, there are many ways hackers can hack public Wi-Fi, let me share a few:</p>\n<p>‘Evil twin’ attack. This is when hackers set up malicious hotspots with seemingly logical and trustworthy names eg ‘Free Café Wi-Fi’. But as soon as you connect, they can easily get their hands on your data.</p>\n<p>Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM). This is when hackers break into a network and eavesdrop on data as it travels between connected devices and the Wi-Fi router. For example, your online banking password!</p>\n<p>Password cracking attack. Scammers use software that automatically tries a huge volume of usernames and passwords so they can control the router. And once they’ve gained control, they can dupe you into downloading malicious software (that could steal your identity) or redirects you to a webpage that phishes for your personal information.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you can possibly survive without public Wi-fi then you need to invest in a VPN that will ensure everything you share is protected.</p>\n<h3>4. Activate Two Factor Authentication</h3>\n<p>If your bank offers two-factor authentication to its customers, then your answer needs to be ‘yes please’! Two-factor authentication or multi factor authentication adds another layer of verification to your banking which minimises the chances of hacker causing you harm. If you’ve activated it, you’ll be asked to provide another piece of information after you’ve entered your login details. Usually a special code, this may be delivered to you via an app, text message or even an automated phone call.</p>\n<h3>5. Request Alerts From Your Bank</h3>\n<p>It will take just a few minutes to ring your bank and request to be notified when an activity occurs on your account. Every bank will manage this differently, however most banks can alert you on request via email or text if the following occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low or high balances</li>\n<li>New credit and debit transactions</li>\n<li>New linked external accounts</li>\n<li>Failed login attempts</li>\n<li>Password changes</li>\n<li>Personal information updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if anything at all seems a little fishy, contact your bank immediately!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few things are guaranteed in life and that includes your online safety. And whether you’re an online banking fan or not, opting out isn’t really an option. So, take some time to tighten up your online banking.

You can’t wait to take time away from your responsibilities, jump out of your daily routine, and splash into a new adventure.

With inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, the research reveals new concerns for leisure-seekers who, in their quest for a good deal, may be more likely to fall for a scam. With 94% of people booking travel online this year, it can be easy to get lured into a deal that’s too good to be true. In today’s economic environment, adults are more likely to seek out a bargain deal online (56%), move quickly to snap up a deal (45%), try a new booking site (35%) and even a new destination (36%), in order to save money. However, travel seekers need to stay vigilant to avoid falling for a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Travel scams can take many forms, with the research finding 14% of all adults have been tricked into making payments through fraudulent platforms and 18% have had their identity stolen when booking online. Of this portion, 7% entered passport information and 11% provided other personally identifiable information to a fake website.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Discrepancies Between Consumers’ Sentiments and Behaviors</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The research also uncovered a discrepancy between people’s sentiments and behaviors, as well as online safety best practices when travelling. In total, 61% of people are more concerned about digital threats than physical ones, such as being pickpocketed, and 85% of adults hold either some or high concern around their identity being compromised as part of their travel. Despite this, 48% admitted to being less security conscious when on holiday. Whether it’s connecting to Wi-Fi networks even though they look a bit suspicious (22%), using a free USB charging port at an airport or train station (26%), or leaving their Netflix account logged in after checking out of their accommodation (17%), significant numbers of people have engaged in activities that could put them at increased risk of crime while traveling.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s not that people are unaware of the dangers either. While 44% of people think their personal information is less secure when they connect to the internet while on vacation, less than half (43%) make use of any services to monitor the safety of their online identity, and 50% don’t use a VPN while on vacation. Of those that do, 20% only do so because they want to stream geo-specific content.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Knowing the risks doesn’t stop travelers from engaging in the behavior. While social media is by far the most common online activity for people to use their phones for while on vacation (60%), also common are chatting with friends and family (55%), online banking (35%) and sending money via apps such as PayPal or Venmo (22%). </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">“People are often more relaxed and carefree when away from home, but it’s never been more important to remain vigilant when traveling,” says Cagla Ruacan, McAfee’s Head of Product Strategy and Insights. “From the moment you open your laptop to book a vacation, to when you log into airport Wi-Fi while waiting for the flight home, staying alert and taking precautions helps keep yourself and your loved ones safe from online travel scams. Taking early and proactive steps to manage your security, privacy and online identity means you’ll be able to more safely and confidently enjoy your well-earned vacation.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to Protect Yourself from Online Summer Travel Scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Be especially aware of your surroundings when you’re on vacation. Pickpockets like to congregate in tourist hotspots, at home and abroad. They take advantage of distracted out-of-towners or awestruck sightseers who are less aware of suspicious behavior.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Before you leave, familiarize yourself with common pickpocketing schemes. For example, if a stranger on the street asks you the time, avoid eye contact and keep walking. In this scam, the stranger will comment on your watch or try to strike up a conversation while their partner scopes out your back pockets. It seems impolite to ignore someone, but if they truly need to know the time, they can ask someone else. Also, how many people are there who don’t have a time-telling device on them?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When walking around a city or taking public transportation, keep your phone in your front pockets or in a zippered bag that you can hold around your front. Consider buying a phone tether or lanyard for your phone. This will make your phone much more difficult to lift since it’s securely wrapped around your body.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

This way, you can proactively head off any issues that could arise when you should be relaxing. For instance, if your wallet is misplaced or stolen while on vacation, a dark cloud of “what ifs” won’t follow you. What if someone took the contents of your wallet and posted your details online? What if someone used those details to impersonate you online?</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fidentity-monitoring%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Identity monitoring</span></a> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">lessens the possibility of these “what ifs” happening to you.

A frozen credit means that credit bureaus will prevent anyone (including you) from signing up for a new credit card in your name. So, in case your wallet or passport goes missing or you paid with your credit card at an establishment of dubious character, you can sleep soundly knowing that your hard-earned credit score is intact. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s a good idea to lock your credit before an incident occurs because speed is key to heading off a thief. Additionally, if you’re traveling abroad, it may be difficult to connect to phone numbers in your home country, especially if you didn’t sign up for a roaming cellular plan.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

A VPN is software that scrambles your internet traffic, making it nearly impossible for a cybercriminal to digitally eavesdrop.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When traveling, especially if you don’t sign up for a roaming cellular or data plan, you’ll rely solely on public Wi-Fi networks in hotels, restaurants, libraries, and transportation hubs. Even if your accommodation’s network is password protected and is offered only to guests, it’s still best to surf with the protection of a VPN because you can’t be sure of the intentions of the hundreds of people connected to it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">VPNs aren’t difficult to set up and once you’re up and running they’re easy to use and do not slow your internet speed. But because you’d rather be poolside instead of comparing VPN plans, it’s best to sign up and become acquainted with the software before you jet off.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5. Prepare for the Possibilities</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The best defense against cybercriminals and thieves is to arm yourself with knowledge. The more aware you are of their schemes, the better you can sniff them out and avoid them. A few weeks before you leave on vacation, check the news and read up on reports about common emerging scams. For example, be wary of public charging stations as criminals are pumping USB charging ports with malware, according to the FBI.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Awareness of schemes like this one can help you better prepare before you leave for vacation. Always leave enough time to fully charge your device before adventuring for the day and consider packing your own power bank if your device’s battery life is unreliable. Also, if you’re traveling to another country, make sure to pack a plug converter so you can plug your devices into outlets instead of USB ports.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Vacation With Cyber Confidence</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is an excellent everyday online security partner.

The name raises all kinds of questions. What is the dark web, really? Where is it? Can anyone hop on it?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Answering these questions can help you stay safer online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The story of the dark web is a complicated one. It’s a small and highly anonymous layer of the internet. As a result, it has a reputation for harboring criminal activity. We often mention the dark web in our blogs, typically when the conversation turns to identity theft, data breaches, and stolen personal information. Rightfully so. Plenty of cybercrime can get traced right back to the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet cybercriminals didn’t create the dark web. And they’re far from the only people who use it. News outlets like the BBC and the </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">New York Times</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> have a presence there, as does the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Journalists, activists, and everyday citizens use it as well, often to work around oppressive censorship. Even Facebook is there, providing people access to the social media site in regions where it’s blocked.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Anonymity reigns on the dark web. It was designed to work that way. With that, it’s home to a mixed bag of activity, legitimate and illicit alike. Yet that anonymity doesn’t stop us from putting a face onto the dark web—from understanding what it is, where it is, and what transpires there. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That starts with a look at the internet and the two primary layers that make it up.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">The layers of the internet: The surface web and the deep web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you visualize the internet as an ocean, you’ll find it populated with websites and collections of data at all depths. Yet, the typical internet user only has access to the first few feet, a layer of the internet known as the surface web. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The sights you’ll see within the surface web will look familiar. It’s all the blogs, shops, social media sites, and so on that you visit regularly. And it’s easy to get to. You only need to fire up your browser and go. All the sites are public facing. With a quick search, you can find them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In all, the surface web contains any destination you can reach through search. To put it more precisely, the surface web accounts for areas of the internet that search engines can “crawl” and index for search. Estimates vary, yet the surface web accounts for roughly 4 to 5% of the internet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, enter the deep web, the next 95% of the internet that is not searchable. Yet, that’s not to say that you don’t travel down into its depths from time to time. In fact, you likely do it daily. Any time you go through a paywall or use a password to access internet content, you’re entering the deep web. The content found there is hidden from search. Examples include logging into your bank account, accessing medical records through your healthcare provider, or using corporate web pages as part of your workday. Even streaming a show can involve a trip to the deep web. None of that content is searchable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As such, the overwhelming majority of activity within the deep web is legitimate. So while this layer of the internet runs deep, it isn’t necessarily dark. The dark web is something altogether different.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is the dark web?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The dark web lives within the deep web. Like the other depths of the deep web, it’s not searchable. The people behind the websites and data collections on the dark web intentionally keep them hidden from search. And the reasons vary. Some of them are entirely legitimate, others questionable, and several are outright illegal in nature. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Its origins go back to the 1990s, when the U.S. Department of Defense developed the dark web as a means of anonymous and encrypted communications. That story might sound familiar. It’s quite like the origin story for the broader internet. That had its roots in the Department of Defense as well. So, just as the broader internet eventually became available to the public, so did the dark web as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Getting there requires a special browser because the protocols for the dark web differ from the surface web. Moreover, these browsers strip web traffic of identifiable information, encrypt it, and send it through a series of server jumps. The browsing traffic will appear to go through a server in one country, then a different server in another, and then another. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">These steps make it highly difficult to identify the person using the browser. On the flip side, it makes it difficult to identify the people hosting the sites and services on the dark web as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Without question, privacy is everything on the dark web. For good and for bad.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Legitimate uses of the dark web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While the notion of the dark web typically gets raised in the context of cybercrime and other illegal activity, it has legitimate uses. Some of these use cases include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Circumventing censorship </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Well-regarded news outlets such as the BBC and Pro Publica maintain a presence on the dark web to ensure that anyone can access their reporting. This includes people in nations and regions where certain news sources are censored. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Private communication</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For the particularly privacy-conscious, the dark web hosts several resources for encrypted communication. That includes email clients, internet chat, and even social media sites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whistleblowing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Anonymous tips are a part of national security, law enforcement, and journalism as well. The private nature of the dark web confers an additional degree of anonymity to tipsters.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The dark web isn’t a place everyday internet users will need, or even want, to go. It’s far more complicated than the surface web—and going in without taking several security measures can make the trip a risky one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The dark web as a marketplace for cybercrime</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is where the rubber meets the road from an online protection </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">standpoint. T</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">he dark web is also a marketplace for hackers and bad actors. In several ways—as a place to purchase and rent malware, a repository for stolen information, and a place to communicate and coordinate attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For starters, the dark web is populated with dark marketplaces. And difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency is the coin of the realm. With dark web stores stocked with ready-made malware kits, bad actors can launch attacks with little need for technical expertise. Others have done the work for them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercrime groups of all sizes prop up these shops, which they also use to rent out other services for attacks. For example, a small-time bad actor could easily lease a </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fwhat-is-a-botnet-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-protecting-smart-home-devices%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">botnet</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to wage an attack that slows a targeted website to a crawl. Some cybercrime groups will provide hackers who can run attacks on someone else’s behalf, creating a mercenary “hacker for hire” gig economy. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, information stolen from a data breach can end up in dark web marketplaces as well. The personal information posted in these marketplaces can range anywhere from emails and passwords to in-depth information like tax numbers, health information, and driver’s license numbers. Some of it goes up for sale. Some of it gets dumped there for free. With the right information in hand, cybercriminals can commit acts of identity theft. That includes claiming unemployment benefits and tax refunds in someone else’s name. In extreme cases, it can lead to bad actors can outright impersonate their victims, racking up debts and criminal records along the way.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some hacking groups sell hacked accounts outright. For a couple hundred dollars, they offer up login and password information for bank accounts that have a couple thousand dollars in them. Also available, pre-hacked email, social media, and online payment accounts. If it’s hackable and has value, it’s likely for sale on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protect yourself from hackers and bad actors on the dark web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With all this shady activity on the dark web, you might wonder how you can protect yourself. In fact, you can take several steps to help prevent your information from finding its way there. And you also can take other steps if your information unfortunately does end up on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Installing online protection software is the first step. Online protection software can help prevent many of the attacks bad actors can purchase on the dark web. It protects against ransomware, adware, spyware, and all manner of malware, whether it’s pre-existing or entirely new. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet today’s online protection goes far beyond antivirus. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive protection like ours protects your privacy and identity as well</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

And that means each one carries a varying degree of risk if it gets breached. Moreover, some sites and services protect data better than others, which adds another dimension of risk.

It lets you have uncannily human conversations with an AI that’s been programmed and fed with information over several generations of development. Provide it with an instruction or ask it a question, and the AI provides a detailed response.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Unsurprisingly, it has millions of people clamoring to use it.

What’s more, they charge people a fee to use them—a prime example of fleeceware. OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, have just officially launched their iOS app for U.S. iPhone users and can be </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com.mcas.ms%2Fapp%2Fopenai-chatgpt%2Fid6448311069%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">downloaded from the Apple App Store here.</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The official Android version is still yet to be released. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fleeceware mimics a pre-existing service that’s free or low-cost and then charges an excessive fee to use it. Basically, it’s a copycat. An expensive one at that. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fleeceware scammers often lure in their victims with “a free trial” that quickly converts into a subscription. However, with fleeceware, the terms of the subscription are steep. They might bill the user weekly, and at rates much higher than the going rate.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The result is that the fleeceware app might cost the victim a few bucks before they can cancel it. Worse yet, the victim might forget about the app entirely and run up hundreds of dollars before they realize what’s happening. Again, all for a simple app that’s free or practically free elsewhere.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What makes fleeceware so tricky to spot is that it can look legit at first glance. Plenty of smartphone apps offer subscriptions and other in-app purchases. In effect, fleeceware hides in plain sight among the thousands of other legitimate apps in the hopes you’ll download it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With that, any app that charges a fee to use ChatGPT is fleeceware. ChatGPT offers basic functionality that anyone can use for free. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There is one case where you might pay a fee to use ChatGPT.

With a subscription, ChatGPT responds more quickly to prompts and offers access during peak hours when free users might be shut out.

They might mention three-day trials that automatically convert to pricey monthly or weekly subscriptions. Moreover, they might describe how payment terms have changed and become more costly as a result. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the case of legitimate apps, billing issues can arise from time to time, so see how the company handles complaints. Companies in good standing will typically provide links to customer service where people can resolve any issues they have. Company responses that are vague, or a lack of responses at all, should raise a red flag.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Be skeptical about overwhelmingly positive reviews.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers are smart. They’ll count on you to look at an overall good review of 4/5 stars or more and think that’s good enough. They know this, so they’ll pack their app landing page with dozens and dozens of phony and fawning reviews to make the app look legitimate. This tactic serves another purpose: it hides the true reviews written by actual users, which might be negative because the app is a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Filter the app’s reviews for the one-star reviews and see what concerns people have. Do they mention overly aggressive billing practices, like the wickedly high prices and weekly billing cycles mentioned above? That might be a sign of fleeceware. Again, see if the app developer responded to the concerns and note the quality of the response. A legitimate company will honestly want to help a frustrated user and provide clear next steps to resolve the issue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Steer clear of third-party app stores.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Google Play does its part to keep its virtual shelves free of malware-laden apps with a thorough submission </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">process,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> as </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.googleblog.com.mcas.ms%2F2021%2F04%2Fhow-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8&amp;McasTsid=20892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">reported by Google</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Your privacy. Because it’s a commodity </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">on today’s internet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For starters, you have advertisers and internet service providers (ISPs) that want to know what you’re doing, when you’re doing it, where you’re doing it, and even for how long you’re doing it. They gather and use this information to create targeted ad profiles. And </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they sell that information to third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Next,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> there are the hackers and identity thieves out there. They take an even greater interest in what you’re doing online—like your shopping, banking, and finances. Even your insurance and medical matters. Primarily they want that information so they can turn a buck by hijacking your accounts or impersonating you to get medical care. In more extreme cases, they </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> use stolen information to impersonate you in other ways. That </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> include opening entirely new lines of credit or getting a driver’s license in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN can prevent this kind of snooping from happening.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">VPNs and privacy—blocking ads and data collection</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As for data collection and ads, that activity should come as no surprise. Particularly for anyone who’s seen uncannily targeted ads follow them around on the internet. Search for “summer cargo pants” one time and suddenly the sites you visit are full of ads for pants, pants, and more pants. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Aside from gathering your online activity for advertising purposes, ISPs might also sell the data they gather to third parties. They can gather that data while you’re on your home network, and they might gather it while you’re using public Wi-Fi. (Some ISPs provide free Wi-Fi in public places that allows them to collect data from people who aren’t their regular customers.)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This practice varies by region and the data privacy laws that are in place in each one. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, the European Union has strict data privacy laws that prevent this type of sale. (Thanks to the enactment of the GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation.) However, there are few such protections in the U.S. There, an ISP can sell the browsing history of an internet user to a third party—provided the data has been anonymized.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“Anonymized” is a key term here. It refers to the process of stripping away personal identifiers that connect a person to a set of stored data. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> also include adding “noise” to the data, which obscures personal identifiers. For example, that might remove an exact birthdate and replace it with a broad range of dates. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, “March 31, 1957” becomes “January – June 1957.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At issue is that this anonymized data can get de-anonymized rather easily. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Researchers in 2019 found that “</span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com.mcas.ms%2Farticles%2Fs41467-019-10933-3%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">99.98% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> using 15 demographic attributes.” And when you consider how much data is collected about you, 15 attributes are </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> drops in the ocean.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Marketing and analytics companies collect hundreds and hundreds of data points on people and their households.

And with manufacturers in a rush to capitalize on the popularity of smart home devices, sometimes security takes a back seat. They might not thoroughly design their products for security up front, and they might not regularly update them for security in the long term. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meanwhile, other manufacturers do a fine job.

Turn off geo-tagging. </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is a good practice on any social media platform. Geo-tagging is a function where the app uses GPS to track your location and then publish it alongside your post. This feature may put your personal safety at risk, since stalkers can use the geotag, context clues, and video background to guess at your location. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Disable tracking and targeted ads.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and gaming apps depend on advertisers’ dollars to make money. To provide users with the most relevant ads (and improve their chances of making a sale), companies gather information about you and build a profile based on your online comings and goings. Most apps that allow tracking must ask your permission first to do so. Always uncheck this box and disable ad tracking, because there’s no guarantee that the PII the ad company collects will stay a secret. Did you know that 98% of people have their personal information up for sale on the internet? </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is an excellent tool to erase your private details from the internet and keep it out of the hands of strangers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

A recent case estimated that some 9 million smartphones had spyware installed in them somewhere along the supply chain. Reportedly, the spyware could steal personal information from the phone or possibly take it over entirely for a short stretch of time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can spot signs of tampering on an Android phone by heading to Settings and searching for “Install Unknown Apps.” If you see any sources that you didn’t set to the “On” position or a third-party website you don’t recognize, it indicates that apps from outside official app stores could have been installed in the device. Such apps are generally riskier than apps from official sources like Google Play. While not an outright indication of spyware, you should set those to “Off.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On an iPhone, directly installing spyware takes a bit more effort. Typically, it requires “jailbreaking” the phone. This process tampers with the operating system and removes software restrictions so the iPhone can access third-party app stores and download unapproved apps. Both are highly risky activities and the reason why Apple’s iOS enforces such restrictions in the first place. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Put plainly, “jailbreaking” is not safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the hands of bad actors, they can install an app called “Cydia” on a jailbroken iPhone. Cydia is an unapproved app store that offers potentially dangerous modifications and apps. If you spot Cydia on your iPhone, it’s certain sign of tampering.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The signs of mobile spyware</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not long ago, you could often see or even feel if your smartphone was infected with spyware. It could run hot, like it was left out on blanket at the beach, because the spyware ate up computing cycles while it ran in the background. It could drain batteries or lead to sluggish performance. That’s not always the case anymore. Spyware has become leaner and more efficient in recent years, so cybercriminals can better mask their attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some signs that are better indicators of spyware include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spikes in data use.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whether through your phone’s data connection or through a Wi-Fi connection, unexpected increases in usage could be a sign that your phone is communicating with a third party.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Difficulty logging into your accounts the first time.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A phone infected with spyware may communicate your activity to a third party, rather than to the legitimate login.

Third-party sites may very well not, and they may intentionally host malicious apps as part of a front. Further, Google is quick to remove malicious apps from their store once discovered, making shopping there safer still. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

If an app asks for way more than you bargained for, like a simple puzzle game that requests access to your camera or microphone, it might be a scam. On Android, recent spyware usually requests REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS permission to execute the malicious behavior in the background. If you see behaviors like these, delete the app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

FOMO can lead them to spend too much time and money on social media, neglect their family or school responsibilities, or engage in risky behaviors to fit in with or impress others. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Suggestion: Help your child understand that it&#8217;s normal to sometimes have FOMO feelings.

While there is no specific Aussie law that dictates the minimum age kids need to be to join social media, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-au%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">most social media platforms require their users to be 13 years old</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to set up an account.

Some do with the consent of their parents, but many don’t. So, if your kids are consulting you on their move into social media, then pat yourself on the back. You’ve done a great job in keeping the lines of communication open and staying relevant. But if yours just charged ahead without involving you (like some of mine did) then it’s still not too late to be part of their journey.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In my opinion, there is no simple answer. A one size fits all approach doesn’t work here. Some kids mature faster than their peers, others may have a bigger dose of emotional intelligence and instinctively understand the ramifications of poor online behaviour. Some kids are more resilient and robust while others are more sensitive. There are so many things to consider when advising but ultimately, this is your call as a parent.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Can I Keep Them Safe?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is where many of us can come unstuck because it can feel so overwhelming knowing where to start.

And these strategies are relevant to all of us parents – regardless of whether your kids are new to social media or old hands!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Asking them what they do online, why they like a certain app and who they play online games with are just some of the ways of starting a conversation. I am also a fan of sharing details of your online life with them too. Whether its sharing new apps with my kids, funny posts, or relevant news articles, I think if I regularly demonstrate that I get social media then I generate a little ‘tech cred’. And when you’ve got ‘tech cred’, they are more likely to come to you when things aren’t going swimmingly. And that’s exactly what we want as parents!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

Passwords</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Without a doubt, one of the most powerful ways to stay safe online is to ensure you have super duper passwords for each of your online accounts. So, take some time to ensure your kids have got this covered. Every online account needs its own individual password that should have no link to your child’s name, school, family, or favourite pet. I’m a big fan of a crazy sentence – I find they are easier to remember. If you include at least one capital letter, a few numbers, and symbols then you’re doing well. Password managers can be a great way of remembering and also generating complex passwords. These can be a godsend when your list of online accounts grows. All you need to do is remember the master password. How good!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And ensure they know to NEVER share passwords. Tell them that passwords are like toothbrushes – never to be shared! That always worked with my boys!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

However, with four kids of my own, I know that curveballs and challenges are often inevitable. But if you’ve developed an open line of communication with your kids and possibly even generated a little ‘tech cred’, then it is likely they will reach out to you if things go awry. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Depending on the issue they are experiencing, you may just need to talk them through the situation. Perhaps they need help understanding they should have expressed something in a less inflammatory way or that they may be over-reacting to a comment. It may be helpful for you to work with them to develop an action plan or formulate a response to someone who is perhaps being a bit tricky.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But if they have experienced behaviour that you consider to be unacceptable, then you may need to take further action. I always recommend taking screen shots of concerning behaviour online. These may be important if you need to take further action down the track. Once you’ve taken screen shots, then block the person who is causing your child grief. You can also report the behaviour to the social media platform. If the perpetrator goes to the same school as your child, then I would approach the school and ask them to assist.

They oversee large cybercrime operations that run much like a business. They employ web designers, coders, marketing teams, and customer call centers that mimic a genuine online retailer. Which makes sense. The more they can look and act like the real thing, the more likely they can lure victims into their online stores.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Smaller bands of scammers get in on this action as well.

They might indeed ship you the goods, but they won’t be the goods you ordered. They’re counterfeit.

They’ll bait shoppers with hard-to-find items, tout steep discounts on other popular items, and otherwise play into the rush of holiday gift buying. Yet they crop up year-round as well. Really, any time you shop is a time to be on the lookout for them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Top tips for safer shopping online</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Directly typing in the correct address for online stores and retailers is a prime way to avoid scammers online. In the case of retailers that you don’t know much about, the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) asks shoppers to do their research. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ensure</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that the retailer has a good reputation. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbb.org.mcas.ms%2Fsearch%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">The BBB makes that easier with a listing of retailers</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you can search by typing in their name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Also in the U.S., you can visit the website of your state’s Secretary of State.

It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

Another key difference: when fraud occurs with a debit card, you fight to get your money back—it’s gone straight out of your account. With a credit card, the issuer fights to get their money back. They’re the ones who take the financial hit.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Additionally, in the U.S., the Fair Credit Billing Act offers the public protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards. The act gives citizens the power to dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly. Note that many credit card companies have their own policies that improve upon the Fair Credit Billing Act as well. However, debit cards aren’t afforded the same protection under the Act. Avoid using a debit card while shopping online and use your credit card instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

It adds a one-time-use code to access your login procedure, typically sent to your smartphone by text or call. Together, that makes it tougher for a crook to hack your account. If any of your accounts support two-factor authentication, the few extra seconds it takes to set up is more than worth the big boost in protection you’ll get.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

They might be legitimate businesses, yet they might be fronts for a convincing-looking scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These ads end up on social media the same way ads from legitimate businesses do, by way of social media ad platforms. Social media companies created these platforms so advertisers can reach millions of individual users based upon their age group, hobbies and interests, past purchases, and so on. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, a scammer </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> target younger shoppers with an interest in retro fashion.

Yet they present some security issues. With effort, fingerprints can get copied, such as by lifting them off a pane of glass or other things you touch. Facial ID can open a phone even when the owner’s eyes are closed. Again with some effort, a thief or bad actor can open the phone by placing it by the sleeping owner’s face. Note that these are more extreme cases, yet you should be aware of them when determining how you lock your phone. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Turn on “Find My Phone.”</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another powerful tool you have at your disposal is the find my phone feature made possible thanks to GPS technology.

Treat your phone like the desirable item it is. That’s a big step when it comes to preventing theft.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keep your phone close.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And by close, we mean on your person. It’s easy to leave your phone on the table at a coffeeshop, on a desk in a shared workspace, or on a counter when you’re shopping. Thieves might jump on any of these opportunities for a quick snatch-and-grab. You’re better off with your phone in your pocket or zipped up in a bag that you keep close.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Secure your bags and the devices you carry in them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Enterprising thieves will find a way. They’ll snatch your bag while you’re not looking.

If you’re stopping to grab a bite to eat, sling the handles through a chair leg. If you have a strong metal carabiner, you can use that too. Securing your bag like that can make it much tougher for a thief to walk by and swipe it. For extra security, look into a slash-resistant bag.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Stay aware.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Thieves will also look for an easy mark. People who appear a little distracted, lost, or even dozing off. Aside from securing your bags, keep an eye on your surroundings. Look at people and smile, walk with purpose, and generally put across an air of confidence. Behavior like this sends a clear signal to thieves—you’re aware. That might be enough for them to pass you up.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Consider what you’re carrying—and where you carry it.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you have a credit card and ID holder attached to the back of your phone, you might want to remove your cards from it.

There’s something about somebody who can tell a funny story that I just love. And humour can be a great bonding experience for us humans. Laughing over a funny video or sharing a hilarious story is pure friendship gold! But humour can often be murky territory online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Kids Love Humour</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of my favourite things about being a mum of boys is the jokes. My boys can make me laugh till I cry. And the jokes and banter they share amongst themselves warms my heart. Sometimes it feels like slapstick comedy other times its brutal and direct and often a little cheeky. Over the years, ‘safe’ boundaries have been developed for their banter so that no-one gets hurt. But it hasn’t always been perfect. It takes a certain level of maturity and a healthy dose of empathy to know where to draw the line with your humour and, unfortunately, not everyone gets this right.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When Is a Joke Just a Joke</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">All friends will joke around with each other, and our tweens and teens are no exception. Whether it’s sharing comments on funny memes or TikTok’s or leaving witty comments on each other’s online posts, online banter can be quite the demonstration of friendship and connection. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But sometimes it is hard to tell if someone is just having fun or trying to ridicule or make fun of another online. Without being able to see someone’s face and read their body language in person, the joker’s intention can often be ambiguous. It may be laughed off with a ‘just kidding’ or ‘relax, you’re too serious’. And so, here we are in the grey area. One of the most common questions I am asked by parents is how to differentiate between jokes and cyberbullying online. And my answer is simple.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you feel hurt by a joke or think others are laughing at you (instead of with you) then the joke has gone too far. Yes, we all have different levels of sensitivity but if you are offended then it’s time to take some action. Now, if it continues after asking for it to stop and you are still feeling upset then this is bullying. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It really is simple – a joke is intended to be humorous without causing harm whereas bullying is intended to cause harm to others. And, of course jokes can sometimes go too far but in most cases an apology and an explanation can remedy any hurt. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When To Take A Stand</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Navigating friendships when you’re in thick of being a teenager can be really tough for some kids particularly those who aren’t as mature or worldly as others. Kids who are a little younger or less experienced with life may feel that they are on the outskirts of their social group. And in my experience, this can be a tough place to be. Regardless of how many times we tell our kids that being popular or accepted doesn’t matter, when you’re 15 it really can. So, if your shy 15-year-old receives a joking message from a kid at school (who he’d like to be friends with) that upsets him, do you need to take action? Or will it jeopardise any chance your child might have to be friends with this child?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I always like to give a person the benefit of the doubt. So, my advice here would be to continue to monitor the situation. If your child receives additional messages that upset him, then he needs to ask the ‘joker’ to stop. Some kids would be OK to manage this themselves while others might need some help. If they need help, I suggest contacting the school or sporting club that your kids have in common and asking them to intervene. Do not contact the child directly yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Teach Your Kids What To Do If They Are Cyberbullied</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of the best things you can do for your kids is ensure they know what to do if they are on the receiving end of behaviour online that they find upsetting.

Messages like these have an urgency to them, and they seem like they’re legit, or they at least seem like they might deal with something you might care about. But of course they’re just a ruse. And some of them can look and sound rather convincing. Or at least convincing enough that you’ll not only give them a look, but that you’ll also give them a click too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And that’s where the troubles start.

A text comes through with a brief message that one of your accounts needs attention, from an entirely unknown number. Along with it is a link that you can tap to follow up, which will send you to a malicious site. In some cases, the sender may skip the link and attempt to start a conversation with the aim of getting you to share your personal information or possibly fork over some payment with a gift card, money order, rechargeable debit card, or other form of payment that is difficult to trace and recover.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the case of social media, you can expect that the attack will come from an imposter account that’s doing its best to pose as one of those legitimate businesses or organizations we talked about, or perhaps as a stranger or even someone you know. And the name and profile pic will do its best to play the part. If you click on the account that sent it, you may see that it was created only recently and that it has few to no followers, both of which are red flags. The attack is typically conversational, much like described above where the scammer attempts to pump you for personal info or money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Attacks that come by direct messaging apps will work much in the same way. The scammer will set up a phony account, and where the app allows, a phony name and a phony profile pic to go along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email gets a little more complicated because emails can range anywhere from a few simple lines of text to a fully designed piece complete with images, formatting, and embedded links—much like a miniature web page. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the past, email phishing attacks looked rather unsophisticated, rife with poor spelling and grammar, along with sloppy-looking layouts and images.

Still, they do several things to try and be convincing. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look right for some reason.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, plus the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in at the top of the email with mention of “There are (42) viruses on your computer.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken all together, you can spot many email scams by taking a closer look, seeing what doesn’t feel right, and then trusting you gut. But that asks you to slow down, take a moment, and eyeball the email critically. Which people don’t always do. And that’s what scammers count on.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Similar ploys see scammers pose as legitimate companies and retailers, where they either ask you to log into a bogus account page to check statement or the status of an order. Some scammers offer links to “discount codes” that are instead links to landing pages designed steal your account login information as well. Similarly, they may simply send a malicious email attachment with the hope that you’ll click it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In other forms of email phishing attacks, scammers may pose as a co-worker, business associate, vendor, or partner to get the victim to click a malicious link or download malicious software. These may include a link to a bogus invoice, spreadsheet, notetaking file, or word processing doc—just about anything that looks like it could be a piece of business correspondence. Instead, the link leads to a scam website that asks the victim “log in and download” the document, which steals account info as a result. Scammers may also include attachments to phishing emails that can install malware directly on the device, sometimes by infecting an otherwise everyday document with a malicious payload.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email scammers may also pose as someone you know, whether by propping up an imposter email account or by outright hijacking an existing account. The attack follows the same playbook, using a link or an attachment to steal personal info, request funds, or install malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to avoid phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While you can’t outright stop phishing attacks from making their way to your computer or phone, you can do several things to keep yourself from falling to them. Further, you can do other things that may make it more difficult for scammers to reach you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Pause and think about the message for a minute.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The content and the tone of the message can tell you quite a lot. Threatening messages or ones that play on fear are often phishing attacks, such angry messages from a so-called tax agent looking to collect back taxes. Other messages will lean heavy on urgency, like the phony McAfee phishing email above that says your license has expired today and that you have “(42)” viruses. And during the holidays, watch out for loud, overexcited messages about deep discounts on hard-to-find items. Instead of linking you off to a proper ecommerce site, they may link you to a scam shopping site that does nothing but steal your money and the account information you used to pay them. In all, phishing attacks indeed smell fishy. Slow down and review that message with a critical eye. It may tip you off to a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Deal directly with the company or organization in question.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks can look rather convincing. So much so that you’ll want to follow up on them, like if your bank reports irregular activity on your account or a bill appears to be past due. In these cases, don’t click on the link in the message. Go straight to the website of the business or organization in question and access your account from there. Likewise, if you have questions, you can always reach out to their customer service number or web page.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Consider, would an income tax collector contact you over social media? The answer there is no. For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fnewsroom%2Fhow-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">in the U.S. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes it quite clear that they will never contact taxpayers via social media</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. (Let alone send angry, threatening messages.) In all, legitimate businesses and organizations don’t use social media as a channel for official communications. They have accepted ways they will, and will not, contact you. If you have any doubts about a communication you received, contact the business or organization in question directly and follow up with one of their customer service representatives. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Don’t download attachments. And most certainly don’t open them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks involve attachments packed with malware like the ransomware, viruses, and keyloggers we mentioned earlier. If you receive a message with such an attachment, delete it. Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them. Scammers will often hijack or spoof email accounts of everyday people to spread malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.Hover over links to verify the URL.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On computers and laptops, you can hover your cursor over links without clicking on them to see the web address. Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all. Or maybe it looks like it almost does, yet it adds a few letters or words to the name. This marks yet another sign that you may have a phishing attack on your hands. Scammers also use the common tactic of a link shortener, which creates links that almost look like strings of indecipherable text. These shortened links mask the true address, which may indeed be a link to scam site. Delete the message. If possible, report it. Many social media platforms and messaging apps have built-in controls for reporting suspicious accounts and messages.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

As for those people who contact you out of the blue, be suspicious. Sad to say, they’re often scammers canvassing these platforms for victims. Better yet, where you can, set your profile to private, which makes it more difficult for scammers select and stalk you for an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7.

Chances are, they pulled that information off a data broker site. Data brokers buy, collect, and sell detailed personal information, which they compile from several public and private sources, such as local, state, and federal records, plus third parties like supermarket shopper’s cards and mobile apps that share and sell user data. Moreover, they’ll sell it to anyone who pays for it, including people who’ll use that information for scams. You can help reduce those scam texts and calls by removing your information from those sites. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">8.

Whether they’re out to crack your bank account, steal personal information, or both, you can learn how to spot phishing emails and keep yourself safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And some of today’s phishing emails are indeed getting tougher to spot. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They seem like they come from companies you know and trust, like your bank, your credit card company, or services like Netflix, PayPal, and Amazon.

Scammers have leveled up their game in recent years. Their phishing emails can look convincing. Not long ago, you could point to misspellings, lousy grammar, poor design, and logos that looked stretched or that used the wrong colors. Poorly executed phishing attacks like that still make their way into the world. However, it’s increasingly common to see far more sophisticated attacks today. Attacks that appear like a genuine message or notice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Case in point:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168907\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal.png 338w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-300x252.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-154x129.png 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Say you got an email that said your PayPal account had an issue.

Who sent the phishing email that directed us to this malicious site? None other than “paypal at inc dot-com.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168893\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"96\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Clearly, that’s a phony email. And typical of a phishing attack where an attacker shoehorns a familiar name into an unassociated email address, in this case “inc dot-com.” Attackers may also gin up phony addresses that mimic official addresses, like “paypalcustsv dot-com.” Anything to trick you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, the malicious site that the phishing email sent us to used a spoofed address as well. It had no official association with PayPal at all—which is proof positive of a phishing attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that companies only send emails from their official domain names, just as their sites only use their official domain names. Several companies and organizations will list those official domains on their websites to help curb phishing attacks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com.mcas.ms%2Ftc%2Fwebapps%2Fmpp%2Fsecurity%2Fcommon-scams%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">PayPal has a page that clearly states how it will and will not contact you</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

The scammers try to mimic the McAfee brand, yet don’t pull it off. Still, they do several things to try to act convincing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168823\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"184\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1.png 184w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1-85x129.png 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look like what McAfee usually sends me.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, and the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in with </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a mention</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of “There are (42) viruses on your computer …”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken all together, someone can readily spot that this is a scam with a closer look.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This next ad falls into the less sophisticated category.

Once again, it hosts plenty of capitalization errors, </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">with</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> a few gaffes in grammar as well. In all, it doesn’t read smoothly.

They hope that you’re moving quickly or otherwise a little preoccupied when you’re going through your email or messages. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Distracted enough</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> so that you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> not pause to think, </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">is</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> this message really legit?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of the best ways to beat scammers is to take a moment to scrutinize that message while keeping the following in mind …</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They play on your emotions.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Fear. That’s a big one. Maybe it’s an angry-sounding email from a government agency saying that you owe back taxes. Or maybe it’s another from a family member asking for money because there’s an emergency. Either way, scammers will lean heavily on fear as a motivator.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you receive such a message, think twice. Consider if it’s genuine. For instance, consider that tax email example.

(They won’t call or apply pressure tactics—only scammers do that.) Likewise, other nations will have similar standards as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They ask you to act—NOW.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Scammers also love urgency. Phishing attacks begin by stirring up your emotions and getting you to act quickly. Scammers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> use threats or overly excitable language to create that sense of urgency, both of which are clear signs of a potential scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Granted, legitimate businesses and organizations </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> reach out to notify you of a late payment or possible illicit activity on one of your accounts. Yet they’ll take a far more professional and even-handed tone than a scammer would. For example, it’s highly unlikely that your local electric utility will angrily shut off your service if you don’t pay your past due bill immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They want you to pay a certain way.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gift cards, cryptocurrency, money orders—these forms of payment are another sign that you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be looking at a phishing attack.

Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all.

Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them.

The NSIS scriptable installer is a highly efficient software packaging utility. The installer behavior is dictated by an NSIS script and users can extend the functionality of the packager by adding custom libraries (dll) known as NSIS plugins. Since its inception, adversaries have abused the utility to deliver malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">NSIS stands for Nullsoft Scriptable Installer. NSIS installer files are self-contained archives enabling malware authors to include malicious assets along with junk data. The junk data is used as Anti-AV / AV Evasion technique.

The Vectored Exception Handling on Windows provides the user with ability to register custom exception handler, which is simply a code logic that gets executed at the event of an exception. The interesting thing about handling exceptions is that the way in which the system resumes its normal execution flow of the program after the event of exception. Adversaries exploit this mechanism and take ownership of the execution flow. Malware can divert the flow to the code which is under its control when the exception occurs.

The pushfd/popfd instructions are followed by the code that when executed throws STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. When program is executed normally, the execution will not reach the code that follows the pushfd/popfd instruction block, thus raising only STATUS_SINGLESTEP. When accidently stepped over the pushfd/popfd block in debugger, the STATUS_SINGLESTEP is not thrown at the debugger as it suppreses this because the debugger is already single stepping through the code, this is detected by the handler logic when we encounter code that follows the pushfd/popfd instruction block wich throws a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. Now it runs into a nested exception situation (the access violation followed by suppressed single stepping exception via trap). Because of this, whenever an access violation occurs, the handler routine checks for nested exception information in _EXCEPTION_POINTERS structure as discussed in the beginning.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Below image shows this the carefully laid out code to detect analysis.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168763\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13.png 652w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13-300x157.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13-205x107.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Egg hunting: VEH Assisted Runtime Padding</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One interesting feature seen in GULoader shellcode in the wild is runtime padding.

The exfiltrated Personal Identifiable Information (PII) extracted from the compromised endpoints are largely collected and funneled to various underground data selling marketplaces. This also impacts businesses as various critical information used for authentication purposes are getting leaked from the personal systems of the user leading to initial access on the company networks. The GuLoader is heavily used in mass malware campaigns to infect the users with popular stealer malware like Raccoon, Vidar, and Redline.

Banking online. Location tracking. If you are a senior adult, there’s no doubt, the digital leaps and bounds you’re asked to consider each day can be daunting. If you are the child of a senior adult trying to make digital life more accessible, helping your parent consistently stay safe online can also be a challenge.</p>\n<p>According to a recent  <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew study</a> on the topic, senior adults continue to become more digitally connected, but adoption rates continue to trail younger users, and digital divides remain. The study also revealed that 77% of older adults needed assistance in learning how to use technology.</p>\n<h2><strong>Privacy path: Awareness &amp; consistency </strong></h2>\n<p>As a senior, it’s easy to feel intimidated and even try to avoid technology altogether as a safety plan. However, more healthcare, banking, and retailers become almost 100% digital, opting out of digital life is becoming impossible.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s a way forward. As with any challenge, it’s best to begin one step at a time. First, put your stake in the ground by committing to increase your awareness and consistency in the digital realm. Doing so will help you reduce your fear about potential data breaches, malware attacks, or worse, falling prey to an online scam. Here are seven more ways to build upon your privacy path.</p>\n<h2><strong>7 Ways to build up your online privacy  </strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Get on a family protection plan.</strong></h3>\n<p>Online protection software safeguards your privacy while also looking after your privacy too. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\">McAfee+ Family plans</a> include personalized protection for each member of the family, including older family members outside the home. For example, a grandparent can set up and manage their own protection for their identity, privacy, computers, and phones. And inviting a grandparent onto the plan is as simple as sending an email.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168779\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps.png 284w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps-205x94.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Update and store your passwords.</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/create-strong-passwords-with-a-password-generator/?hilite=%27passwords%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Updating your passwords</a> regularly is an online privacy gamechanger. The only problem? It’s tough to remember all those passwords, so who wants to risk changing them, right? <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consider a password manager</a> (find the software packages that have a password manager built-in). Your Password Manager (PM) stores then populates the username and password fields every time you log on to a favorite site or app. Better yet, it makes changing your password an easy task since you don’t need to do any remembering—your PM does it all for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).</strong></h3>\n<p>What in the world? 2FA sounds complicated! Don’t worry, it’s not. Opting for 2FA means that before logging onto your account, you will have one more step to verify <em>it’s you logging on</em>. When given this privacy option, take it. Commonly, the 2FA process is a code generated by a smartphone app—no biggie. If you want to try, go to your settings in your favorite apps, such as Google or Facebook, and turn on the 2FA option.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Install software updates immediately.</strong></h3>\n<p>Along with strong passwords, updating your software is a front-line defense against identity theft and fraud. Installing software updates (those pesky pop-up notices that are critical to your privacy) is essential in securing your IoT devices, PCs and phones, and the social media, banking, and healthcare portals connected to them.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</strong></p>\n<p>If we could write this one tip down a hundred times without losing our readers, we surely would. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/vpn?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Every senior adult needs a VPN</a> for practical, powerful privacy protection and peace of mind. A VPN keeps credit card and personal info contained in a secure network and away from prying eyes.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Fight back with knowledge.</strong></h3>\n<p>Fraudulent emails connected to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/cruel-ghouls-new-digital-scams-target-every-age-group/?hilite=%27COVID%27%2C%27scams%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fraudulent websites</a> can look very legitimate. A secure website will have an “HTTPS” in the browser’s address bar. The “s” stands for “secure.” If the web address or URL is just HTTP, it’s not a secure site. Still unsure? Read reviews of the site from other users before making a purchase. Never send cash, cashier’s check, or a personal check to any online vendor. If purchasing, always use a credit card in case there is a dispute. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-reports/how-to-spot-and-prevent-the-tax-scams-that-target-elders/?hilite=%27scams%27%2C%27and%27%2C%27seniors%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stay up-to-date on scams</a> that target seniors specifically. Lately, elder scams have been constructed around COVID, dating apps, tax returns, employment, and, of course, the common <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/8-signs-that-grandmas-getting-baited-by-a-catfish/?hilite=%27elderly%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">military catfish scams</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Clean up your digital breadcrumbs.</strong></h3>\n<p>Like it or not, companies gather, share, and sell plenty of information about us online. Among them, online data brokers that collect information about people from public records and third parties, like shopping information from the discount cards we use to get deals at the supermarket or drug store. They compile this information and post it online for anyone to see, for a price. And they’ll sell it to anyone. That includes marketers, advertisers, and even bad actors who use it for scams and to help them commit identity theft. You can clean up these digital breadcrumbs, though. Our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. We’ll also provide guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and with select products, we can even manage the removal for you. ​</p>\n<h2><strong>Have fun as you skill up.</strong></h2>\n<p>When trying to boost your digital skills, don’t forget about all the amazing instructional content at your fingertips. A quick search of YouTube will render easy-to-understand videos on how to do just about everything (including install security software, change your router password, secure the smart devices in your home, and how to adjust your privacy settings on any device).</p>\n<p>Learning or building a new skill isn’t always easy, but if you stop to think about it, as a senior, you’ve gained so many skills over your lifetime (far more than your juniors). So, practically speaking, building up your tech skills is one is just one more task to ace. So, lean into the challenge, have fun learning, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/7-savvy-ways-senior-adults-can-safeguard-digital-privacy/\">7 Savvy Ways Senior Adults Can Safeguard Digital Privacy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"New Wave of SHTML Phishing Attacks","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/shtml-phishing-attack-with-blurred-image/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"pubDate":"Mon, 08 May 2023 11:10:18 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=168432"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Authored By Anuradha McAfee Labs has recently observed a new wave of phishing attacks.

so malware is restricting all the normal users from turning the Windows Defender on. When attackers disable Windows Defender through the registry, the change is likely to persist even if the user or administrator tries to re-enable it through the Windows Defender settings.

By using the Amadey botnet as a delivery mechanism for other malware, attackers can leverage these same capabilities to evade detection and maintain persistence on infected computers. They can use Amadey to drop a wide range of malware, such as spyware, ransomware, and trojans, which can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, encrypting files for ransom, or taking control of a computer for use in a larger botnet. Our analysis of various samples of this attack has revealed that the Amadey botnet distributes malware from multiple families and is not restricted to Redline Stealer alone.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At McAfee, we are committed to providing our customers with robust and effective antivirus and anti-malware solutions that can detect and protect against threats like the Amadey botnet and other malware families.

I discovered it a few years back when it became apparent that group messages to a close cluster of girlfriends weren’t being received by my Android pals. WhatsApp solved that problem instantly. But then over several years, I realized it solved quite a few other pesky problems namely expensive and tricky phone calls when travelling overseas and my frustration at not being able to send a message to a large group of people. I became a fan girl!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for WhatsApp users, over the years there have been scams including the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcyware.com.mcas.ms%2Fnews%2Fscammers-trick-whatsapp-users-by-offering-1000gb-free-data-on-the-apps-10th-anniversary-085e453b%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">10</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">th</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> birthday scam where users were offered the chance to win 1000GB of free data</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and most recently the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2F7news.com.au.mcas.ms%2Ftechnology%2Ffresh-warning-about-bizarre-whatsapp-message-you-should-never-respond-to--c-7752914%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">‘mum and dad’</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> scam.

But what does that actually mean? In short, it means that your messages can only be read on the recipient’s phone. Likewise, video and audio calls can only be answered by the intended receiver. WhatsApp encrypts every message sent on its platform which means the only people who can decode it are the sender and the receiver. WhatsApp can’t access anything you share and nor could a hacker if they were to intercept a message. Love end-to-end encryption!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But this doesn’t mean that there are no risks using WhatsApp. Like all online platforms, staying ahead of the risks is the smartest way of ensuring you have the best experience. And there are several steps you can take to stay ahead of the threats on WhatsApp. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My Top Tips To Stay Safe While Using WhatsApp</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Turn On Automatic Updates</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keeping your WhatsApp software up to date is essential as updates will almost always include fixes or ‘patches’ for new vulnerabilities and threats. Why not automate them to ensure that this happens? This means you won’t be at risk if you forget to update the software yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Be Careful What You Share</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Never ever share personal data or crucial financial information on the app, in case your device ends up in the wrong hands or it becomes infected with spyware or malware. And this goes for any app – keep your personal information nice and tight. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Ignore Suspicious Messages</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As anyone can message anyone on WhatsApp, it’s inevitable you may receive some random or suspicious looking messages. Always err on the side of caution and do not respond to direct messages from people you don’t know. If you receive a promotional offer from a company that is quite tempting, go directly to their website to confirm. Scammers will often send out 1000’s of emails with a tempting offer and link to a malicious website in the hope that someone will ‘bite’. Don’t be caught in a phishing scam!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

Without your 6-digit pin number, a hacker can’t get into your account, even if they get their hands on the SMS code they need to activate your account on another device. And it takes 30 seconds to set up! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6. Be Aware Of The Most Common WhatsApp Hacking Strategy</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you haven’t set up your 6-digit pin, then you are at risk at being ‘socially hacked’. This is how it works: a hacker, who has hijacked one of your friend’s accounts, will message you asking for the 6-digit code that’s just been sent to your account. They will say it’s meant for them. And as you ‘know’ this person, you are likely to send that code straight through without even questioning them. But in fact, the 6-digit code in question has been requested by the hacker for your account, so the minute you share it &#8211; you will be immediately locked out! So, never ever share your 6-digit code with anyone. No-one will ever have a legitimate reason to request it.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But please don’t let these risks put you off this fantastic messaging app. I’m a big believer in understanding the challenges so you can prepare yourself, go ahead and enjoy! And I haven’t even touched on some of the more fun aspects of the app – the stickers &amp; the status updates – they can be quite the conversation starter! So go ahead and enjoy but just make sure you’ve done your homework!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Stay safe everyone!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-be-safe-on-whatsapp/\">How To Be Safe On WhatsApp</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Strongest Passwords and the Best Way to Create (and Remember) Them","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 04 May 2023 12:36:34 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"password protection"},{"#cdata-section":"World Password Day"},{"#cdata-section":"password manager"},{"#cdata-section":"password management tools"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=167588"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Some of the strongest passwords you can use are the ones you don’t have to remember.  Strange as that may...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/\">The Strongest Passwords and the Best Way to Create (and Remember) Them</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some of the strongest passwords you can use are the ones you don’t have to remember.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strange as that may sound, it’s true, if you use a password manager. A password manager creates and securely stores strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts—and does all the remembering for you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">And remembering is the root of the problem when it comes to insecure passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consider how many passwords you have across all your accounts. Then consider the old passwords for accounts and online forums you no longer use, along with all the times you created a password for an online store that you only shopped at once or twice. All those passwords, it’s too much to keep track of, let alone manage. And that leads to insecure passwords. Simple passwords.

Hackers will look for the quickest payday. In some cases they’ll work with a long list of accounts that they’re trying to break into. If a password on that list proves difficult to crack they’ll move on to the next in the hope that it’ll have a poor password that they can easily crack. It’s a sort of hacker economics. There’s often little incentive for them to spend extra time on a strong password when there are plenty of weak ones in the mix.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">So what do poor passwords look like?

However, this means that if hackers compromise one of your accounts, all your other accounts are vulnerable. This is a favorite tactic of hackers. They’ll target less secure accounts and services and then attempt to re-use those credentials on more secure services like online bank and credit card companies. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal information passwords:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Passwords that include your birthday, dog’s name, or nickname leave you open to attack.

Yet the apps that use location tracking may do more with your location data than that. They may collect it, and in turn sell it to advertisers and potentially other third parties that have an interest in where you go and what you do. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, cell phone providers have other means of collecting location information from your phone, which they may use for advertising and other purposes as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If that sounds like more than you’re willing to share, know that you can do several things that can limit location tracking on your phone—and thus limit the information that can potentially end up in other people’s hands.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How do Smartphones Track Your Movements?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As we look at the ways you can limit location tracking on your phone, it helps to know the basics of how smartphones can track your movements.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For starters, outside of shutting down your phone completely, your phone can be used to determine your location to varying degrees of accuracy depending on the method used: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">GPS:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The Global Positioning System, or GPS as many of us know it, is a system of satellites operated by the U.S. government for navigation purposes. First designed for national defense, the system became available for public use in the 1980s. It’s highly accurate, to anywhere between nine to 30 feet depending on conditions and technology used, making it one of the strongest tools for determining a phone’s location. This is what powers location services on cell phones, and thus can help an app recommend a great burger joint nearby.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cell towers:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Cell phone providers can track a phone’s location by the distance it is to various cell phone towers and by the strength of its signal. The location information this method provides is a bit coarser than GPS, providing results that can place a phone within 150 feet. It’s most accurate in urban areas with high densities of cell phone towers, although it does not always work well indoors as some buildings can weaken or block cell phone signals. One of the most significant public benefits of this method is that it automatically routes emergency services calls (like 911 in the U.S.) to the proper local authorities without any guesswork from the caller.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Public Wi-Fi:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Larger tech companies and internet providers will sometimes provide free public Wi-Fi hotspots that people can tap into at airports, restaurants, coffeehouses, and such. It’s a nice convenience but connecting to their Wi-Fi may share a phone’s MAC address, a unique identifier for connected devices, along with other identifiers on the smartphone. Taken together, this can allow the Wi-Fi hosting company to gather location and behavioral data while you use your phone on their Wi-Fi network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Bluetooth:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Like with public Wi-Fi, companies can use strategically placed Bluetooth devices to gather location information as well. If Bluetooth is enabled on a phone, it will periodically seek out Bluetooth-enabled devices to connect to while the phone is awake. This way, a Bluetooth receiver can then capture that phone’s unique MAC address. This provides highly accurate location information to within just a few feet because of Bluetooth’s short broadcast range. In the past, we’ve seen retailers use this method to track customers in their physical stores to better understand their shopping habits. However, more modern phones often create dummy MAC addresses when they seek out Bluetooth connections, which helps thwart this practice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now here’s what makes these tracking methods so powerful: in addition to the way they can determine your phone’s location, they’re also quite good at determining your identity too. With it, companies know who you are, where you are, and potentially some idea of what you’re doing there based on your phone’s activity.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Throughout our blogs we refer to someone’s identity as a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces are larger than others, like your Social Security number or tax ID number being among the biggest because they are so unique. Yet if someone gathers enough of those smaller pieces, they can put those pieces together and identify you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Things like your phone’s MAC address, ad IDs, IP address, device profile, and other identifiers are examples of those smaller pieces, all of which can get collected. In the hands of the collector, they can potentially create a picture of who you are and where you’ve been.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What Happens to Your Location Information That Gets Collected?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What happens to your data largely depends on what you’ve agreed to. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In terms of apps, we’ve all seen the lengthy user agreements that we click on during the app installation process. Buried within them are terms put forth by the app developer that cover what data the app collects, how it&#8217;s used, and if it may be shared with or sold to third parties. Also, during the installation process, the app may ask for permissions to access certain things on your phone, like photos, your camera, and yes, location services so it can track you. When you click “I Agree,” you indeed agree to all those terms and permissions. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Needless to say, some apps only use and collect the bare minimum of information as part of the agreement. On the other end of the spectrum, some apps will take all they can get and then sell the information they collect to third parties, such as data brokers that</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> build exacting profiles of individuals, their histories, their interests, and their habits. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In turn, those data brokers will sell that information to anyone, which can be used by advertisers along with identity thieves, scammers, and spammers. And as reported in recent years, various law enforcement agencies will purchase that information as well for surveillance purposes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, some apps are malicious from the start.

Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt malicious code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out.

Back up your data </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A cybercriminal has no leverage if your device doesn’t house anything of value. Back up your most important files every few months, either to the cloud or save them onto a hard drive. This way, if you do get a ransomware infection, you can wipe your device and reinstall your files from the backup.

It’s dangerous to reuse the same password across accounts because all it takes to put your accounts at risk is for one data breach to leak your password onto the dark web. It’s nearly impossible to memorize all your different password and username combinations, so entrust a password manager to store them for you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Two or multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security, as it requires multiple forms of verification to enter an online account. For instance, you’ll be asked to verify your identity through a one-time code sent to a cellphone or to answer a security question in tandem with a correct password. This additional step in the login process deters ransomware plots because if you store your important documents behind a multi-factor authentication-protected cloud program, the criminal has nothing of value to hold hostage. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Be careful where you click</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Don’t click on links or respond to emails, social media direct messages, and texts from people you don’t know.

Awareness of your digital surroundings is another way to keep your device and PII safe. Steer clear of websites that look sloppy, and do not stream or download content from unofficial sites. Malware is often hidden in links on dubious sites. Try your best to stick to sites that have URLs beginning with “https.” The “s” stands for “secure.” Though not all “https” sites are guaranteed secure, they are generally more trustworthy than plain “http” sites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To safeguard your Wi-Fi connection, protect your home router with a strong password or passphrase. When connecting to public Wi-Fi, confirm with the hotel or café’s staff their official Wi-Fi network name. Then, make sure to connect to a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your online activity, which makes it impossible for someone to digitally eavesdrop. Never access your personal information when on an unprotected public Wi-Fi network. Leave your online banking and shopping for when you’re back on a locked network or VPN you can trust.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, a comprehensive antivirus software can clean up your device of malicious programs it might have contracted. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes unlimited VPN and antivirus, plus a whole lot more to keep all your devices safe.

They target some of our most important and precious things—our files, our photos, and our information stored on our devices.

Worse yet, paying the ransom is no guarantee the hacker will return them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s what a ransomware attack does. Broadly speaking, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it’s a type of malware that infects a network or a device and then typically encrypts the files, data, and apps stored on it, digitally scrambling them so the proper owners can’t access them.

Small-time hackers and hacking groups can find the tools they need to conduct such attacks by shopping on the dark web, where ransomware is available for sale or for lease as a service (Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS).

Like any other type of malware, it can infect your device via a phishing link or a bogus attachment. It can also end up there by downloading apps from questionable app stores, with a stolen or hacked password, or through an outdated device or network router with poor security measures in place. And as mentioned above, infected storage devices provide another avenue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social engineering attacks enter the mix as well, where </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the hacker poses as someone the victim knows and gets the victim to either download malware or provide the hacker access to an otherwise password-protected device, app, or network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And yes, ransomware can end up on smartphones as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Smartphone ransomware can </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">encrypt files, photos, and the like on a smartphone, just as it can on computers and networks. Yet other forms of mobile ransomware don’t have to encrypt data to make the phone unusable. The “Lockerpin” ransomware that has struck some Android devices in the past would change the PIN number that locked the phone. Other forms of lock screen ransomware would simply paste a warning over the home screen with a “pay up, or else” message.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Still, ransomware isn’t as prevalent on smartphones as it is on computers, and there are several reasons why. For the most part, smartphone ransomware relies on people downloading malicious apps from app stores. Both Google Play and Apple’s App Store both do their part to keep their virtual shelves free of malware-laden apps with a thorough submission process, as reported by </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.googleblog.com.mcas.ms%2F2021%2F04%2Fhow-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Google</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com.mcas.ms%2Fguide%2Fsecurity%2Fapp-security-overview-sec35dd877d0%2Fweb%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Apple</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet, bad actors find ways to sneak malware into the stores. Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt malicious code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, Android allows users to download apps from third-party app stores that may or may not have a thorough app submission process in place, which can make them more susceptible to hosting malicious apps. Moreover, some third-party app stores are actually fronts for organized cybercrime gangs, built specifically to distribute malware.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Basic steps to protect yourself from a ransomware attack.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">First, back up your data and files.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The people behind these attacks play on one of your greatest fears—that those important and precious things on your device might be gone forever. Yet with a backup, you have little to fear. You can simply restore any data and files that may have come under attack. Consider using a reputable cloud storage service that you protect with a strong, unique password. Similarly, you can back up your data locally on an external drive that you keep disconnected from your network and stored in a secure location. So while a backup won’t prevent an attack, it can most certainly minimize any threat or damage from one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be careful of what you click.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Ransomware attackers use phishing emails, bogus direct messages in social media, and texts to help install malware on your device. Many of these messages can look quite legitimate, like they’re coming from a brand you know, a financial institution, or even the government. The links embedded in those messages will take you to some form of malicious website where you’re prompted to download a phony file or form—which is actually malware. Similarly, some phishing emails will simply send malware to the recipient in the form of a malicious attachment that masquerades as a legitimate document like an invoice, spreadsheet, or shipping notice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Use online protection software.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This provides your first line of defense. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes several features that can stop a ransomware attack before it takes root: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Safe surfing features that warn you of malicious downloads, attachments, and websites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strong antivirus that spots and neutralizes the latest malware threats with the latest antivirus technologies.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Vulnerability scanners that help keep your device and its apps up to date with the latest security measures.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A firewall that helps prevent intruders from accessing the devices on your network—and the files on them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet more ways you can prevent ransomware attacks.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That list is just for starters.

WhatsApp is no different, where scammers spin up bogus accounts and attempt to start conversations with other users. The way they go about it varies. They may try to kindle a romance scam, they may masquerade as a business representative, or even pose as a tax collector or other government official. The aim is always the same, though. They want to steal your personal information or trick you into forking over your money. Don’t take chances. Don’t talk to strangers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Other scammers will send messages with malicious links. Just as you shouldn’t follow links or open files from strangers in other apps, don’t do open them on WhatsApp either. Those links are simply gateways to scam sites and malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Do you back up your WhatsApp chats?

Even if that is in a relatively secure cloud service such as Apple’s or Google’s. Yet the risk of data breaches remains, as does the risk of a bad actor gaining access to one’s cloud account, such as through a stolen password.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, for an increased degree of privacy and security, you may want to consider disabling cloud backup for your WhatsApp messages.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Protect your phone too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> can protect your phone in the same ways that it protects your laptops and computers.

And how can it make your time online more secure—and a little more private too? Here we’ll take a look at what a VPN is, what it has to offer, and how that benefits you.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is a VPN and how does it protect me? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN is an app that you install on your device to help keep your data safe as you browse the internet. When you turn on your VPN app, your device makes a secure connection to a VPN server that routes internet traffic. Securely. This keeps your online activity private on any network, shielding it from prying eyes. Thus, while you’re on a VPN, you can browse and bank with the confidence that your passwords, credentials, and financial information are secure. If any malicious actors attempt to intercept your web traffic, they’ll only see garbled content thanks to your VPN’s encryption functionality.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN change my IP address? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every internet connection is assigned a unique set of numbers called an IP address, which is tied to information such as geographic location or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). A VPN replaces your actual IP address to make it look like you’ve connected to the internet from the physical location of the VPN server, rather than your real location. This is just one reason why so many people use VPNs. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How can I use a VPN to change my IP address?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To change your IP address, you simply open your VPN app, select the server location you’d like to connect to, and you’re done. You’re now browsing with a new IP address. If you’d like to make sure your IP has changed, open a browser and search for “What’s my IP address” and click on one of the results. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When should I use a VPN? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">An ideal case for using a VPN is when you’re using public Wi-Fi at the airport, a café, hotel, or just about any place “free Wi-Fi” is offered. The reason being is that these are open networks, and any somewhat enterprising cybercriminal can tap into these networks and harvest sensitive information as a result.

You can use a VPN to help stop advertisers from tracking you. Searches you perform and websites you visit won’t be traced back to you, which can prevent advertisers from gleaning information about you and your online habits in general. Moreover, some ISPs collect the browsing history of their users and share it with advertisers and other third parties. A VPN can prevent this type of collection as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Can a VPN protect my search history? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN protects your search history through the secure connection you share. When you search for a website, or type a URL into your navigation bar, your device sends something called a DNS request, which translates the website into the IP address of the web server. This is how your browser can find the website and serve its content to you. By encrypting your DNS requests, a VPN can hide your search habits and history from those that might use that info as part of building a profile of you. This type of info could be used in a wide variety of ways, from legitimately serving targeted ads to nefarious social engineering.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are VPNs and “Incognito Mode” and “Private Mode” in browsers the same thing?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that a VPN is quite different and far, far more comprehensive than using “Private Mode” or “Incognito Mode” on your browser. Those modes only hide your search history locally on your device—not from others on the internet, like ISPs and advertisers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN make me anonymous? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">No, a VPN cannot make you anonymous.

Your IP address is visible to your network provider and to the first relay, which is operated by Apple. Your DNS records are encrypted, so neither party can see the address of the website you’re trying to visit. The second relay, which is operated by a third-party content provider, generates a temporary IP address, decrypts the name of the website you requested, and connects you to the site. All of this is done using the latest internet standards to maintain a high-performance browsing experience while protecting your privacy.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559685&quot;:864,&quot;335559737&quot;:864,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that as of this writing, Apple Private Relay is not available in all countries and regions.

Why would a cybercriminal target that smart lightbulb in your living room reading lamp? Networks are only as secure as their least secure device. Thus, if a cybercriminal can compromise that smart lightbulb, it can potentially give them access to the entire home network it is on—along with all the other devices and data on it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These devices make desirable targets for another reason. They can easily get conscripted into botnets, networks of hijacked computers and devices used to amplify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that organize the devices into an attacking host that can flood a target with so much traffic that it cannot operate. DDoS attacks can shut down websites, disrupt service and even choke traffic across broad swathes of the internet. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org.mcas.ms%2Fwiki%2FMirai_(malware)%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">the “Mirai” botnet attack of 2016</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, where hackers targeted a major provider of internet infrastructure?

Well, as the case with many early IoT devices, the fault lies within the weak default passwords that many manufacturers employ when they sell these devices. These passwords include everything from “admin123” to the product’s name. The practice is so common that they get posted in bulk on hacking websites, making it easy for cybercriminals to simply look up the type of device they want to attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Complicating security yet further is the fact that </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.fit.edu.mcas.ms%2Facademics-research%2Fapps-for-popular-smart-home-devices-contain-security-flaws-new-research-finds%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">some IoT and smart home device manufacturers introduce flaws in their design, protocols, and code that make them susceptible to attack</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

The solution, however, starts with manufacturers that develop IoT devices with security in mind.

This could mean that your device and thousands of others just like it all share the same credentials, which makes it painfully easy for a hacker to gain access to them because those default usernames and passwords are often published online. When you purchase any IoT device, set a fresh password using a strong method of password creation, such as ours. Likewise, create an entirely new username for additional protection as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Use multi-factor authentication.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Online banks, shops, and other services commonly offer multi-factor authentication to help protect your accounts—with the typical combination of your username, password, and a security code sent to another device you own (often a mobile phone). If your IoT device supports multi-factor authentication, consider using it there too. It throws a big barrier in the way hackers who simply try and force their way into your device with a password/username combination.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Secure your internet router too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another device that needs good password protection is your internet router. Make sure you use a strong and unique password there as well to help prevent hackers from breaking into your home network. Also consider changing the name of your home network so that it doesn’t personally identify you. Fun alternatives to using your name or address include everything from movie lines like “May the Wi-Fi be with you” to old sitcom references like “Central Perk.” Also check that your router is using an encryption method, like WPA2 or the newer WPA3, which will keep your signal secure.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Upgrade to a newer internet router.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Older routers may have outdated security measures, which may make them more prone to attack.

If you’re using your own, visit a reputable news or review site such as Consumer Reports for a list of the best routers that combine speed, capacity, and security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Update your apps and devices regularly.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In addition to fixing the odd bug or adding the occasional new feature, updates often address security gaps. Out-of-date apps and devices may have flaws that hackers can exploit, so regular updating is a must from a security standpoint. If you can set your smart home apps and devices to receive automatic updates, even better.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Set up a guest network specifically for your IoT devices.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just as you can offer your guests secure access that’s separate from your own devices, creating an additional network on your router allows you to keep your computers and smartphones separate from IoT devices. This way, if an IoT device is compromised, a hacker will still have difficulty accessing your other devices on your primary network, the one where you connect your computers and smartphones.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Shop smart.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Read trusted reviews and look up the manufacturer’s track record online.

The examples above show how greatly that&#8217;s changed. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Today, hackers use malware to make a profit, whether by holding your device and data hostage, tricking you into revealing your personal information so the hacker can access your financial accounts, or by installing spyware that secretly steals information like passwords and account info while you use your device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That’s what makes zero-day threats so dangerous for us today. Hackers can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities through different means, but traditionally web browsers have been the most common, due to their popularity. Attackers also send emails with attachments, or you might click a link in the body of an email that automatically downloads malware. All of these could now be putting you at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, security measures have come a long way since the early days. In particular, the antivirus applications included with today’s comprehensive online protection software have technologies in place that directly combat zero-day threats—specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Without getting too technical about it, strong antivirus uses AI and ML to sniff out malware by looking at how an application or device is behaving and if that behavior looks suspicious based on past patterns. In other words, strong antivirus is smart.

Update your browser, operating system, and applications</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> In addition to often providing new features and functionality, updates fix the vulnerabilities in your apps and operating systems, which strengthens your protection against malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Uninstall old apps</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The more software you have, the more potential vulnerabilities you have. By uninstalling old apps, you leave hackers with fewer avenues of attack. Take a look at your computers and smartphones. Delete the old apps you no longer use, along with any accounts and data associated with them as well. Another benefit is that this can potentially reduce your risk if the companies behind those apps get hit by a data breach.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Don’t click on links in emails, texts, and direct messages </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is a good rule of thumb in general, but it can definitely help you protect against zero-day attacks. The same holds true for email attachments. Never open them from unknown senders. And if you receive one from a friend, family member, or co-worker, take a quick second to confirm that they sent it. Some attackers masquerade as people we know, and in some cases hack their accounts so they can spread malware in their name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Zero-day threats call for zero-day protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As the number of apps and devices on the internet have seen explosive growth in recent years, so has the volume of malware—much of it zero-day threats that take advantage of newly discovered vulnerabilities. Hidden within millions and millions of lines of code, dependencies, and interactions, zero-day threats will remain the rule, rather than the exception.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, antivirus technology has more than kept up, particularly by leaning on smart technologies that can detect zero-day threats before they become known threats. Using strong antivirus, as part of online protection software that contains even more security features still, remains an absolute best practice for anyone who spends any kind of time online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-a-zero-day-threat/\">What is a Zero-Day Threat?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Your Guide to Ransomware—and Preventing It Too","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/your-guide-to-ransomware-and-preventing-it-too/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Sun, 09 Apr 2023 10:18:26 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"Guide to Ransomware"},{"#cdata-section":"Ransomware guide"},{"#cdata-section":"Preventing ransomware"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=163081"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Ransomware.

Even the name sounds scary.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When you get down to it, ransomware is one of the nastiest attacks a hacker can wage. They target some of our most important and precious things—our files, our photos, and the information stored on our devices. Think about suddenly losing access to all of them and being forced to pay a ransom to get access back. Worse yet, paying the ransom is no guarantee the hacker will return them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s what a ransomware attack does. Broadly speaking, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it’s a type of malware that infects a network or a device and then typically encrypts the files, data, and apps stored on it, digitally scrambling them so the proper owners can’t access them. Only a digital key can unlock them—one that the hacker holds.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nasty for sure, yet you can take several steps that can greatly reduce the risk of it happening to you. Our recently published Ransomware Security Guide breaks them down for you, and in this blog we’ll look at a few reasons why ransomware protection is so vital.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How bad is ransomware, really?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The short answer is pretty bad—to the tune of </span><a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">billions of dollars stolen from victims each year</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Ransomware targets people and their families just as explained above. Yet it also targets large organizations, governments, and even companies that run critical stretches of energy infrastructure and the food supply chain. Accordingly, the ransom amounts for these victims climb into millions of dollars. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A few recent cases of large-scale ransomware attacks include: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">JBS Foods, May 2021 –</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Organized ransomware attackers targeted JBS’s North American and Australian meat processing plants, which disrupted the distribution of food to supermarkets and restaurants.

The pipeline operator said they paid nearly $4.5 million to the hackers responsible, some of which was recovered by U.S. law enforcement. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Kaseya, July 2021 –</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> As many as 1,500 companies had their data encrypted by a ransomware attack that followed an initial ransomware attack on Kaseya, a company that provides IT solutions to other companies. Once the ransomware infiltrated Kaseya’s systems, it quickly spread to Kaseya’s customers. Rather than pay the ransom, Kaseya’ co-operated with U.S. federal law enforcement and soon obtained a decryption key that could restore any data encrypted in the attack. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Who’s behind such attacks? Given the scope and scale of them, it’s often organized hacking groups. Put simply, these are big heists. It demands expertise to pull them off, not to mention further expertise to transfer large sums of cryptocurrency in ways that cover the hackers’ tracks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As for ransomware attacks on people and their families, the individual dollar amounts of an attack are far lower, typically in the hundreds of dollars. Again, the culprits behind them may be large hacking groups that cast a wider net for individual victims, where hundreds of successful attacks at hundreds of dollars each quickly add up. One example: a hacker group that posed as a government agency and as a major retailer, which </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/politics/fbi-usb-hackers-warning/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">mailed out thousands of USB drives infected with malware</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other ransomware hackers who target people and families are far less sophisticated. Small-time hackers and hacking groups can find the tools they need to conduct such attacks by shopping on the dark web, where ransomware is available for sale or for lease as a service (Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS). In effect, near-amateur hackers can grab a ready-to-deploy attack right off the shelf.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken together, hackers will level a ransomware attack at practically anyone or any organization—making it everyone’s concern.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How does ransomware end up on computers and phones?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hackers have several ways of getting ransomware onto one of your devices. Like any other type of malware, it can infect your device via a phishing link or a bogus attachment. It can also end up there by downloading apps from questionable app stores, with a stolen or hacked password, or through an outdated device or network router with poor security measures in place. And as mentioned above, infected storage devices provide another avenue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social engineering attacks enter the mix as well, where </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the hacker poses as someone the victim knows and gets the victim to either download malware or provide the hacker access to an otherwise password-protected device, app, or network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And yes, ransomware can end up on smartphones as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While not a prevalent as other types of malware attacks, smartphone ransomware can </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">encrypt files, photos, and the like on a smartphone, just as it can on computers and networks. Yet other forms of mobile ransomware don’t have to encrypt data to make the phone unusable. The “Lockerpin” ransomware that has struck some Android devices in the past would change the PIN number that locked the phone. Other forms of mobile ransomware paste a window over the phone’s apps, making them unusable without decrypting the ransomware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Avoiding ransomware in the first place</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Part of avoiding ransomware involves reducing human error—keeping a watchful eye open for those spammy links, malicious downloads, bogus emails, and basically keeping your apps and devices up to date so that they have the latest security measures in place. The remainder relies on a good dose of prevention. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our Ransomware Security Guide provides a checklist for both.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It gets into the details of </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">what ransomware looks like and how it works, followed by the straightforward things you can do to prevent it, along with the steps to take if the unfortunate ends up happening to you or someone you know.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ransomware is one of the nastiest attacks going because it targets our files, photos, and information, things we don’t know where we’d be without. Yet it’s good to know you can indeed lower your risk with a few relatively simple steps. Once you have them in place, chances are a good feeling will come over you, the one that comes with knowing you’ve protected what’s precious and important to you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/your-guide-to-ransomware-and-preventing-it-too/\">Your Guide to Ransomware—and Preventing It Too</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"What Parents Need To Know About TikTok’s New Screen Time Limits","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-parents-need-to-know-about-tiktoks-new-screen-time-limits/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 18:59:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Family Safety"},{"#cdata-section":"children's privacy on TikTok"},{"#cdata-section":"tiktok screen time limit"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=167576"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Social media platforms often get a hard time by us parents.

But no, my friends – not so fast! Tik Tok’s new screen time limits are all about parental involvement – which is why I am a fan! So, buckle-up because if you have an under 18 on TikTok (and you’re committed to their digital well-being) then my prediction is that you’ll soon know more about this social media platform than you even thought was possible! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How Do The New Screen Time Limits Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Over the coming weeks, every account that belongs to an under 18-year-old will automatically be set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit. Once they’ve clocked up an hour of scrolling, teens will be asked to enter a passcode, which TikTok will supply, to keep using the platform. TikTok refers to this as an ‘active decision’. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, clearly this isn’t quite the silver bullet to all your screen time worries as teens can choose to opt out of the 60-minute limits. But if they do choose to opt out and then spend more than 100 minutes a day on the platform, they will be prompted to set a daily screen time limit. ‘Will that actually do anything?’ &#8211; I hear you say. Well, in the first month of testing this approach, TikTok found that this strategy resulted in a 234% increase in the use of its screen time management tools – a move in the right direction!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">But Wait, There’s More…</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But here’s the part I love the most: TikTok offers Family Pairing which allows you to link your child’s account to yours. And as soon as you enable Family Pairing, your teen is no longer in control of their own screen time. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, don’t get me wrong – I am not a fan of the authoritarian approach when it comes to all things tech. I do prefer a consultative ‘let’s work together’ vibe. However, TikTok’s move to involve parents in making decisions about their child’s screen time means that families will need to talk digital wellbeing more than ever before and here’s why&#8230;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Within the Family Pairings settings, parents are able to set screen time limits based on the day of the week which means homework and holidays can be worked around. There is also a dashboard that shows your child’s screen time usage, the number of times the app was opened plus a breakdown of time spent during the day and night. Now, with all this control and information, you’ll be in quite the powerful position so be prepared to be sold hard by your teen on many the benefits of TikTok! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Maybe It’s Time for A Family Digital Contract?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For years I have been a fan of creating a Family Digital Contract which means you get to outline your family’s expectations around technology use. Now the agreement can include time spent online, the sites that can be visited and even the behaviour you expect of your child when they are online. So, if your kids are avid TikTok users then I highly recommend you do this ASAP.

And that’s OK if they understand why their actions weren’t ideal and you have a suitable level of confidence that they will get back on track. However, if you have concerns that they need an additional level of structure to ensure their digital wellbeing remains intact then that’s when TikTok’s Family Pairing can work a treat!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It&#8217;s no secret that social media can be incredibly captivating, possibly even addicting, for so many. And it’s not just TikTok – Instagram, Facebook even Twitter has all been designed to give us regular hits of dopamine with each scroll, like and post. And while I know that parental controls are only one part of the solution, they can be very handy if you need to bring your tween’s usage under control.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remember, Conversations Are King!</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But when all is said and done, please remember that the strength of your relationship with your child is the best way of keeping them safe online and their wellbeing intact.

In some cases, the sender may skip the link and attempt to start a conversation with the aim of getting you to share your personal information or possibly fork over some payment with a gift card, money order, rechargeable debit card, or other form of payment that is difficult to trace and recover.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the case of social media, you can expect that the attack will come from an imposter account that’s doing its best to pose as one of those legitimate businesses or organizations we talked about, or perhaps as a stranger or even someone you know. And the name and profile pic will do its best to play the part. If you click on the account that sent it, you may see that it was created only recently and that it has few to no followers, both of which are red flags. The attack is typically conversational, much like described above where the scammer attempts to pump you for personal info or money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Attacks that come by direct messaging apps will work much in the same way. The scammer will set up a phony account, and where the app allows, a phony name and a phony profile pic to go along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email gets a little more complicated because emails can range anywhere from a few simple lines of text to a fully designed piece complete with images, formatting, and embedded links—much like a miniature web page. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the past, email phishing attacks looked rather unsophisticated, rife with poor spelling and grammar, along with sloppy-looking layouts and images. That’s still sometimes the case today. Yet not always. Some phishing emails look like the real thing. Or nearly so.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Examples of phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Case in point, here’s a look at a phishing email masquerading as a McAfee email:</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-166860\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY.png 228w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY-183x300.png 183w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY-79x129.png 79w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s a lot going on here. The scammers try to mimic the McAfee brand, yet don’t quite pull it off. Still, they do several things to try and be convincing. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look right for some reason.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, plus the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in at the top of the email with mention of “There are (42) viruses on your computer.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken all together, you can spot many email scams by taking a closer look, seeing what doesn’t feel right, and then trusting you gut. But that asks you to slow down, take a moment, and eyeball the email critically. Which people don’t always do. And that’s what scammers count on.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Similar ploys see scammers pose as legitimate companies and retailers, where they either ask you to log into a bogus account page to check statement or the status of an order. Some scammers offer links to “discount codes” that are instead links to landing pages designed steal your account login information as well. Similarly, they may simply send a malicious email attachment with the hope that you’ll click it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In other forms of email phishing attacks, scammers may pose as a co-worker, business associate, vendor, or partner to get the victim to click a malicious link or download malicious software. These may include a link to a bogus invoice, spreadsheet, notetaking file, or word processing doc—just about anything that looks like it could be a piece of business correspondence. Instead, the link leads to a scam website that asks the victim “log in and download” the document, which steals account info as a result. Scammers may also include attachments to phishing emails that can install malware directly on the device, sometimes by infecting an otherwise everyday document with a malicious payload.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email scammers may also pose as someone you know, whether by propping up an imposter email account or by outright hijacking an existing account. The attack follows the same playbook, using a link or an attachment to steal personal info, request funds, or install malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to avoid phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While you can’t outright stop phishing attacks from making their way to your computer or phone, you can do several things to keep yourself from falling to them. Further, you can do other things that may make it more difficult for scammers to reach you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Pause and think about the message for a minute.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The content and the tone of the message can tell you quite a lot. Threatening messages or ones that play on fear are often phishing attacks, such angry messages from a so-called tax agent looking to collect back taxes. Other messages will lean heavy on urgency, like the phony McAfee phishing email above that says your license has expired today and that you have “(42)” viruses. And during the holidays, watch out for loud, overexcited messages about deep discounts on hard-to-find items. Instead of linking you off to a proper ecommerce site, they may link you to a scam shopping site that does nothing but steal your money and the account information you used to pay them. In all, phishing attacks indeed smell fishy. Slow down and review that message with a critical eye. It may tip you off to a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Deal directly with the company or organization in question.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks can look rather convincing. So much so that you’ll want to follow up on them, like if your bank reports irregular activity on your account or a bill appears to be past due. In these cases, don’t click on the link in the message. Go straight to the website of the business or organization in question and access your account from there. Likewise, if you have questions, you can always reach out to their customer service number or web page.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Consider the source.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When scammers contact you via social media, that in of itself can be a tell-tale sign of a scam. Consider, would an income tax collector contact you over social media? The answer there is no. For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fnewsroom%2Fhow-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">in the U.S. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes it quite clear that they will never contact taxpayers via social media</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. (Let alone send angry, threatening messages.) In all, legitimate businesses and organizations don’t use social media as a channel for official communications. They have accepted ways they will, and will not, contact you. If you have any doubts about a communication you received, contact the business or organization in question directly and follow up with one of their customer service representatives. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Don’t download attachments. And most certainly don’t open them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks involve attachments packed with malware like the ransomware, viruses, and keyloggers we mentioned earlier. If you receive a message with such an attachment, delete it. Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them. Scammers will often hijack or spoof email accounts of everyday people to spread malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5. Hover over links to verify the URL.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On computers and laptops, you can hover your cursor over links without clicking on them to see the web address. Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all. Or maybe it looks like it almost does, yet it adds a few letters or words to the name. This marks yet another sign that you may have a phishing attack on your hands. Scammers also use the common tactic of a link shortener, which creates links that almost look like strings of indecipherable text. These shortened links mask the true address, which may indeed be a link to scam site. Delete the message. If possible, report it. Many social media platforms and messaging apps have built-in controls for reporting suspicious accounts and messages.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

As for those people who contact you out of the blue, be suspicious. Sad to say, they’re often scammers canvassing these platforms for victims. Better yet, where you can, set your profile to private, which makes it more difficult for scammers select and stalk you for an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7.

Chances are, they pulled that information off a data broker site. Data brokers buy, collect, and sell detailed personal information, which they compile from several public and private sources, such as local, state, and federal records, plus third parties like supermarket shopper’s cards and mobile apps that share and sell user data. Moreover, they’ll sell it to anyone who pays for it, including people who’ll use that information for scams. You can help reduce those scam texts and calls by removing your information from those sites. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">8.

But those days have long gone. Unless you have been living off the grid and opted out of life completely, having an online presence is now essential. Whether you’re paying bills, booking appointments or renewing your insurance premiums, many companies have made it almost impossible to conduct your business in person, forcing even the most reluctant of us online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now, many of us consider ourselves to be proactive in managing just what we share online by using VPNs, not always setting up accounts with online stores and ensuring our social media privacy settings are nice and tight. But unfortunately, managing your privacy online is more complicated than that. In fact, most of us maybe sharing our private information online every day without even knowing. So, in the spirit of keeping you safe – here are three different areas that I suggest you focus on to ensure you know exactly where you are sharing your private information</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Your Everyday Browsing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every time you visit an online site, send an email, search for information or basically do anything online, multiple parties collect this information. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP), Wi-Fi network administrator, operating system e.g. Windows or iOS, search engine plus the websites and apps you use will all keep a record of what’s you’re up to – even if you are in Incognito Mode!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This information is often gathered using cookies – small files that are placed on your device by the website that you visit. These are created whenever you visit a website, and they contain data about your visit. Some websites are required by law to advise you if and when they use cookies but if you choose to reject cookies, your browsing experience can become really clunky.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What each of these parties does with your private information varies. Your ISP, for example, can easily put together a pretty accurate profile based on your searching, location and downloads and link this to your IP (unique) address.

Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">malicious </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Beyond Google Play, Android allows users to download apps from third-party app stores, which may or may not have a thorough app submission process in place.

Sometimes, you might not. Some malware can make your phone run poorly, which may indicate a technical issue, yet it can also be a symptom of a hacked phone. Others work quietly in the background without you knowing it. Either way, both cases provide good reasons to run regular scans on your phone.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Let’s look at some possible signs:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sluggish performance, battery drain, and a hot phone </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Malware has a way of taking up resources and eating up battery life as it furiously does its work in the background. For example, adware or clicker malware can hijack your phone and tap the central processing unit to run the complex calculations needed to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, thus putting high stress on your device. In a way, it’s like having a second person using your phone at the same time as you are. This can make your phone hot to the touch, like it’s been sitting in the sun, because the stress malware puts on your phone could cause it to overheat.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Popup ads suddenly appear on your phone. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Adware is annoying as it sounds, and potentially even more malicious in nature. If popup ads suddenly pepper your phone, it may be malware that distributes ads without your consent, which can generate revenue for rogue developers (they can get paid per view and per click). Worse yet, adware can also collect personal information and browsing history from your phone, which bad actors can then sell—a major invasion of your privacy.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Mysterious apps, calls, calendar events or texts crop up in your history. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A potential telltale sign that your phone has been compromised is the appearance of new apps that you didn’t download, along with spikes in data usage that you can’t account for.

The first is to keep a critical eye open as you use your phone. Malware authors rely on us to trust what we see a little too quickly, such as when it comes time to download that new app or tap on a link in a phishing email that looks legitimate, yet most certainly isn’t upon closer inspection. Slow down and scrutinize what you see. If something seems fishy, don’t tap or interact with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The second big step is to </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com.mcas.ms%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.wsandroid.suite%26shortlink%3Dmmsandroid%26pid%3DWeb%26c%3DHome%2520page%2520mobile%2520blade%2520-%2520Android%2520CTA%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">use online protection software on your Android phone</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Along with installing security software, keeping your phone’s operating system up to date can greatly improve your security.

It’s another tried and true method of keeping yourself safe—and for keeping your phone running great too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Avoid third-party app stores.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> As mentioned above, Google Play has measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure.

Further, Google is quick to remove malicious apps from their store once discovered, making shopping there safer still.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Review apps carefully.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Check out the developer—have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Go with a strong recommendation.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Yet better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors themselves. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keep an eye on app permissions.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Another way hackers weasel their way into your device is by getting permissions to access things like your location, contacts, and photos—and they’ll use malicious apps to do it. If an app asks for way more than you bargained for, like a simple game wanting access to your camera or microphone, it may be a scam. Delete the app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Stay on guard against mobile malware</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Scammers have put Android phones in their crosshairs. And for some time now. While phishing emails and smishing texts with sketchy links persists as avenues of attack, a popular form of attack comes by way of malicious app downloads. One reason why is that malicious apps disguise themselves so well, as a utility or game you really want on your phone. You’re more apt to tap “Install” when you’re actively shopping for an app than to tap on a link in an unsolicited email or text.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet as with so many of today’s online attacks, a combination of good sense and strong online protection software can prevent viruses and malware from ending up on your phone.

It’s time for spring cleaning.</p>\n<p>And that goes for your digital stuff too.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s indeed spring where you are or not, you can give your devices, apps, and online accounts a good decluttering. Now’s the time. Cleaning them up can <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs\">protect your privacy and your identity</a> because when there’s less lying about, there’s less for hackers to scoop up and exploit.</p>\n<p>The reality is that we accumulate plenty of digital clutter that needs cleaning up from time to time. Think about it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bunches of one-off accounts at online stores we won’t frequent again.</li>\n<li>Membership in messages board or forums you no longer drop in on.</li>\n<li>Plenty of outdated apps and programs that are still sitting on your devices.</li>\n<li>Aging files that are no longer relevant, like spreadsheets and records from years ago.</li>\n<li>And photos—oh, photos! We have plenty of those, right?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Seven steps for digital spring cleaning</strong></h3>\n<p>Together, these things take up space on your devices and, in some cases, can open you up to security hazards. Let’s take a look at how you can clean up in a few steps.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Review your accounts and delete the ones you don’t use.</strong> Look through your bookmarks, your password manager, or the other places where you store your passwords and usernames. Review the sites and services associated with them critically. If you haven’t used an account in some time, log in one last time, remove all personal info, and deactivate it.</p>\n<p>Doing so can keep your email address, usernames, and passwords out of unnecessary circulation. Major breaches <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/shinyhunters-exposes-over-125-million-online-credentials/?hilite=%27shiny%27\">like this one</a> happen with unfortunate regularity, and the sad thing is that you may not even be aware that a site you’ve used has been hit. Meanwhile, your name, password, and info associated with that account (such as your credit card) are in the hands of hackers. Limit your exposure. Close those old accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Get organized, and safer too, with a password manager.</strong> While <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27\">creating strong, unique passwords for each of our accounts</a> is a must nowadays, it can be quite the feat, given all of the accounts in our lives. Here’s where <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/why-do-i-need-a-password-manager/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27\">a password manager</a> comes in. It can create those strong, unique passwords for you. Not only that, but it also stores your passwords on secure servers, away from hackers and thieves.</p>\n<p>Along those lines, never store your passwords on your computer or device, like a text document or spreadsheet. Should your device ever get compromised, lost, or stolen, having passwords stored on them are like handing over the keys to your digital life.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Clean your PC to improve your performance <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs\">(and your security)</a>.</strong> Let’s face it, so many of us are so busy with the day-to-day that cleaning up our computers and laptops is way down the list. However, doing so once a month can keep our devices running stronger for longer and even give you that “new computer feeling,” particularly if you haven’t cleaned it up for some time. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/does-pc-cleaning-improve-performance\">Check out our guide for improving PC performance</a>. We will walk you through some straightforward steps that can make a marked difference.</p>\n<p>Moreover, part of this process should entail bolstering your operating system and apps with the latest updates. Such updates can not only improve speed and functionality, but they also often include security upgrades as well that can make you safer in the long run. If your operating system and apps feature automatic updates, enable them, and they’ll do the work for you.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Organize and store your photos.</strong> Photos. Now there’s a topic all unto itself. Here’s the thing: Estimates show that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/12-trillion-photos-to-be-taken-in-2017-thanks-to-smartphones-chart-2017-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worldwide we took somewhere around 1.2 trillion photos. </a>And you certainly have your share.</p>\n<p>However, your photos may be just sitting there, taking up storage space on your computer or phone, instead of becoming something special like an album, greeting cards, a wall hanging, or popping them into a digital picture frame for your kitchen or living room. And this is where a little spring cleaning can be a bit of fun. For tips on cleaning up your photos, backing them up, and making something special with them.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Delete old apps and the data associated with them.</strong> Let’s say you have a couple of apps on your phone for tracking your walks, runs, and exercise. You’ve since stopped using one altogether. Go ahead and delete the old one. But before you do, go in and delete your account associated with the app to ensure that any data stored off your phone, along with your password and user id are deleted as well.</p>\n<p>For your computers and laptops, follow the same procedure, recognizing that they also may have account data stored elsewhere other than on your device.</p>\n<p>In short, many apps today store information that’s stored and maintained by the app provider. Make sure you close your accounts so that data and information is taken out of circulation as well.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Shred your old files and encrypt the important files you’re holding on to.</strong> This bit of advice calls for using comprehensive security software on your devices. In addition to protecting you from viruses, malware, and other cyberattacks on your privacy and identity, it can help you protect your sensitive information as well. Such security software can offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File encryption, which renders your most sensitive files into digital gibberish without the encryption key to translate them back.</li>\n<li>A digital file shredder that permanently deletes old files from your computer (simply dropping them into the desktop trashcan doesn’t do that—those files can be easily recovered).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs\">Identity theft protection</a> monitors the dark web for your personal info that might have been leaked online and immediately alerts you if you might be at risk of fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7. Throwing away old computers and tech—dispose of them properly.</strong> When it comes time to say goodbye to an old friend, whether that’s a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet, do so in a way that’s friendly to the environment and your security.</p>\n<p>Consider this … what’s on that old hard drive of yours? That old computer may contain loads of precious personal and financial info on it. The same goes for your tablets and phones. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers some straightforward advice in their article about <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-data-you-get-rid-your-computer\">protecting your data before you get rid of your computer</a>. You don’t want those old tax returns ending up in the trash unprotected.</p>\n<p>When it comes time for disposal, you have a few options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look into the e-waste disposal options in your community. There are services that will dispose of and recycle old technology while doing it in a secure manner.</li>\n<li>Some mobile carriers have turn-in programs that will not only dispose of your tech properly, but they’ll give you a financial incentive too—such as money towards a new device.</li>\n<li>Lastly, consider the option of reusing the device. There are opportunities to pass it along to a family member or even donate old devices too. Your old tech may be a game-changer for someone else. Again, just be sure to protect that old data!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>As with any spring cleaning, you’ll be glad you did it</strong></p>\n<p>Enjoying the benefits of your work—that’s what spring cleaning is all about, right? With this little list, you can end up with a digital life that’s safer and faster than before.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/digital-spring-cleaning-seven-steps-for-faster-safer-devices/\">Digital Spring Cleaning: Seven Steps for Faster, Safer Devices</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How to Protect Yourself Against Tax Scams","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-against-tax-scams/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jasdev Dhaliwal"},"pubDate":"Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:19:51 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"tax season"},{"#cdata-section":"tax scam"},{"#cdata-section":"taxes"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=166244"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_Protect-Tax-Scams.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_Protect-Tax-Scams.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_Protect-Tax-Scams-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Who else loves tax season besides accountants?

The complexity, and even uncertainty, of filing a proper tax return can stir up anxieties like, </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Have I filed correctly</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Did I claim the right deductions</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Will I get audited</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, and </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Will I get stung with a tax penalty</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> are just a few—and these are the very same anxieties that criminals use as the cornerstone of their attacks.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet like so many scams, tax scams give off telltale signs that they’re indeed not on the up-and-up. You have ways you can spot one before you get caught up in one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Scammers prey on the uncertainty of tax season</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In all, we’ve learned to watch our step with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), so much so that receiving a notification from the IRS can feel like an unwanted surprise. </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Uh oh, did I do something wrong?</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> However, in reality, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com.mcas.ms%2Fsites%2Fkellyphillipserb%2F2015%2F04%2F12%2F5-things-taxpayers-are-irrationally-afraid-of-and-shouldnt-be%2F%3Fsh%3D5842a0262954%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">less than 2% of returns get audited</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and most discrepancies or adjustments can get handled easily if addressed promptly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Still, that wariness of the IRS makes for ripe pickings when it comes to hackers, who prey on people’s fear of audits and penalties. Common scams include email phishing attacks, phone calls from crooks posing as IRS agents, texts claiming there’s a problem with our tax software, and even robocalls that threaten jail time for unpaid back taxes. What’s more, fraudsters can take things a step further by committing identity theft and then filing tax claims in other people’s names.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With that, let’s dig into a list of the top scams winding up on our screens and phones during tax time. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tax scams to look out for</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This IRS </span></b><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Dirty Dozen</span></i></b><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">: Top tax-season scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Straight from the authority itself, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fnewsroom%2Fdirty-dozen%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">the IRS publishes its </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dirty Dozen</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\">, an annual list of the top tax season scams</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.
