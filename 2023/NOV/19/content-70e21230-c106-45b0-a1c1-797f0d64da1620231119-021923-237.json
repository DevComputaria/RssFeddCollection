Because DNA is the unique code that defines all of our physical attributes and more. So the hacking of online DNA testing service 23andMe is particularly concerning.</strong></p>\n<h2><b>What is 23andMe?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23andMe provides a DNA profiling and matching service, allowing customers to mail a sample of saliva for testing. 23andMe then tests the sample to create a genetic profile and compare it against other samples in their database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are given a report that details their genetic heritage, an understanding of their ancestry and some indications of genetic predispositions.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What happened?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to 23andMe, hackers were able to break into their system. The attackers used a technique called ‘credential stuffing’ to compromise thousands of user accounts and to download all of their sensitive data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23andMe later confirmed that more than 100,000 accounts had been broken into. The stolen information includes full names, usernames, profile photos, sex, date of birth, genetic ancestry results, and geographical location for each user account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hackers behind the attack later offered the stolen information for sale for as little as $1 each.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What is credential stuffing?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers regularly buy and sell lists of stolen usernames and passwords. Criminals can then try to log into other websites using these credentials.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technique is called ‘stuffing’ because the hackers create scripts to test thousands of credentials automatically, within a matter of hours. When they work, the credentials are recorded, allowing the hackers to come back later and steal whatever data they can.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Who is to blame for the 23andMe attack?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality is that credential stuffing attacks only work for one reason – people reusing the same passwords for multiple online accounts. If the compromised 23andMe accounts had been secured with a unique password, the credential stuffing attack would not have worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This incident underscores the importance of using unique passwords for every online account – otherwise your most sensitive, personal data may be stolen and sold. Obviously creating and memorizing strong, unique passwords can be difficult, so we recommend using a </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">password manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to simplify the process.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What can we learn from the 23andMe attack?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the dangers of reusing passwords, there are a few other factors to consider from this event. First, when using or sharing the most sensitive of personal information, you must be sure the online service is secure. If 23andMe had used </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/support/card?id=300156\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two-factor authentication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protect user accounts, it is unlikely that a credential stuffing would work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, users must make a value judgement. Is the information produced by a service like 23andMe worth the risk of potential exposure? This is a very difficult decision – and one that can only be made by you.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/dna-profiles-stolen-23andme/\">Customer DNA profiles stolen from online profiling services 23andMe</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/dna-profiles-stolen-23andme/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Holiday shopping cyber security safety tips 2023","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/holiday-shopping-safety-tips/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/holiday-shopping-safety-tips/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 12:32:43 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"operating systems"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30595"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/11/Holiday-shopping-panda-security--300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Holiday shopping\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">Tips to help consumers enjoy the festive season and not fall victim to the cyber scams popping up on the internet as fast as the Black Friday deals.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/holiday-shopping-safety-tips/\">Holiday shopping cyber security safety tips 2023</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/11/Holiday-shopping-panda-security--300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Holiday shopping\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /><p><strong>The holiday shopping season has officially arrived as some of the first Black Friday early specials are already gaining traction among buyers.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the past, Black Friday was just a busy shopping day. Then, it became a long shopping weekend that starts on Thanksgiving evening and lasts until <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday/\">Cyber Monday</a>. Lately, the buying frenzy morphed into a Black Friday season covering most of November. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retailers are not the only ones gaining well during the shopping season. Cybercriminals also know that people tend to loosen their wallets during this time of the year and try to take advantage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few tips to help consumers enjoy the festive season and not fall victim to the cyber scams popping up on the internet as fast as the <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/safely-shop-black-friday-deals/\">Black Friday</a> deals.</span></p>\n<h2>Our 5 safety tips</h2>\n<h3><b>Shop from reputable retailers</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting festive season stuff from known places decreases the chances of getting scammed while shopping online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While some people dislike doing business with large online retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, those are relatively safe when purchasing goods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumers can still get scammed, but big online retailers also have ways to reimburse the victim in case things are not as expected. And if consumers don’t go with a big retailer, it is always good to go with an online store they’ve used before. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Use credit instead of debit cards</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing goods with a debit card or e-checks could be harmful as banks are not as quick to refund money in a dispute between a seller and a buyer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, they cannot help get a refund at all and forward victims to law enforcement, which limits chances for reimbursement even more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, most credit card companies and some payment processing apps have relatively effective ways to take care of their customers after disappointing online purchases.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Use common sense</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure that the shopping website is legit is essential. While buying something much cheaper from an unknown version of eBay may be tempting, sticking to familiar online outlets is a must. Almost anyone with basic IT knowledge can set up an online shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the online shop is legit, the IT budget of the small business might be so low that it unknowingly could be infected with malicious code that steals card details as people order.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Be protected</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopping online is much easier if a computer device is adequately protected with antivirus software. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, security-enhanced firewalls and <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/\">VPNs</a> prevent people from accessing sites with questionable security risks or reported cyber incidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better protection on a connected device, the more unlikely it will be for a person to end up in the wrong place.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Don’t reuse login information</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smaller online shops often don’t have advanced security protocols, and the chances they are compromised are high. In many cases, small business owners never even realize they are being hacked as cyber criminals steal all the customers’ login info and continue on their merry way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad actors know that people practice poor password hygiene and reuse login info, so criminals try to exploit those reused login details. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always use different email addresses and/or usernames and uncommon passwords that differ from the ones used for banking or payment service providers such as <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/uk/home\">PayPal</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Friday season could be an enjoyable one if you make sure that you shop around safely. However, it can quickly become a nightmare if you fall victim to one of the traps set by criminals. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Be smart and protect yourself well while on a shopping spree. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/holiday-shopping-safety-tips/\">Holiday shopping cyber security safety tips 2023</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/holiday-shopping-safety-tips/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Is paying the ransom worth it?","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/paying-the-ransom/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/paying-the-ransom/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Mon, 06 Nov 2023 10:49:45 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"operating systems"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30589"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/11/is-paying-ransom-worth-it-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Is paying the ransom worth it?\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">Cybercriminals are targeting individuals and organizations of all sizes.

It is a common myth that hackers only target large organizations and wealthy individuals. </span></p>\n<h2>The Risks of Paying a Ransom</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals indeed are money-driven, but often, large organizations and persons with more resources are also more prepared to deal with attacks. The more people have to lose, the better security they have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, ordinary people also get hit by hackers, but such news rarely get covered by the media. In many cases, individuals are too embarrassed or scared even to report the incident to the authorities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals prefer organizations and individuals with large pockets, but this is not their favorite way to pick a target – what they like the most is easy access. The less prepared victims are, the more attractive they are to hackers. And sadly, once infected, things can go sideways pretty quickly. </span></p>\n<h3>Why do hackers use ransomware?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, people and organizations which had fallen under a cyber-attack have to decide whether paying a ransom is worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ransom-as-a-Service (<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-RaaS?Offer=abt_pubpro_AI-Insider\">RaaS</a>) organizations claim that they have made it easy for victims to eliminate the malicious code and sweep the problem under the rug by simply paying the ransom. And many individuals and businesses fall down the rabbit hole pointed by the fraudsters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what organizations often learn the hard way is that once cyber criminals see that their efforts are rewarded, they return for more. It often happens within the same month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, paying the <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/darkside-ransomware/\">ransom</a> and going on with your day does not mean you are entirely off the hook. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>What are the risks of paying a ransom?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be tempting to comply with the hackers&#8217; demands, but getting hacked again is just one of many potential problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, criminals are located in countries sanctioned by the US government, and people paying a ransom may end up being in hot water for breaking international laws. Paying up a ransom is generally not illegal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, government agencies strongly suggest businesses and individuals not to send money because this could land them in hot water with the government – the last thing North American organizations or individuals want is to be seen as sponsors of a terrorist organization located on the other side of the world. </span></p>\n<h3>Should you pay a ransom?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement agencies also say that it is wrong to pay a ransom because this encourages the scammers to continue operating and look for other potential victims. As you can see, complying with fraudsters&#8217; demands could have severe implications for you and your business. Consequences could be worse than having downtime or losing precious data. </span></p>\n<h2>How to protect yourself from ransomware attacks</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you wish to decrease the chances of having to make such a difficult decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that case, you must ensure that your personal and business systems and networks are well fortified against attacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the latest and greatest in the <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/\">antivirus</a> world is a must for the technology-driven life we are all living in the 21st century. Being prepared is always helpful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are ready enough, you can handle the uncomfortable situation much more effortlessly, i.e., you can investigate where the problem is and then restore from a backup and patch the vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The level of preparation needed varies by the size and type of items you want to protect, but generally, leaving cybersecurity on the backburner is not a wise decision, and such decisions eventually almost always come back to haunt you.   </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/paying-the-ransom/\">Is paying the ransom worth it?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/paying-the-ransom/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"9 ways to tell if your phone has been hacked","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/9-ways-phone-hacked/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/9-ways-phone-hacked/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:48:13 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"apps"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"performance"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30580"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/11/9-ways-phone-hacked-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"9 ways to tell if your phone has been hacked\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">Across the world, more people now own a smartphone than a computer.

Hackers will often automatically install fake apps on compromised devices so they can steal information.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> You run out of data unexpectedly<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p>Bandwidth-hungry apps like YouTube and TikTok can use up a lot of your data allowance. But what if your smartphone is consuming lots of data when you’re not using it? This kind of behavior suggests that your phone is sending data to a hacker in the background – or maybe it has become part of a <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/what-is-a-botnet/\"><span>botnet</span></a><span>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Your phone is disconnected<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p>If you suddenly lose network access (you can’t send and receive calls or messages) the problem is usually caused by a local telecoms outage. But it may also indicate that your phone number has been transferred to another provider as part of an identity theft scam.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Your cloud passwords are reset<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/gcp/?hl=en&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=emea-es-all-es-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-gcp-1011340&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_526889161906-ADGP_Hybrid%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20GCP%20~%20General%23v6-KWID_43700053286723539-kwd-6458750523-userloc_9067650&amp;utm_term=KW_google%20cloud-NET_g-PLAC_&amp;&amp;gad=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkY2qBhBDEiwAoQXK5WfPK7CmVMdKmuYJ9_03qg_AJgPyrWAPWA1JNumYl7snIVoC33OP_hoCf2QQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Google Cloud</a> and iCloud are really useful for protecting photos and other data from being lost. And hackers will often target cloud storage for that reason. If you receive <i><span>genuine</span></i><span> messages from Apple/Google about password reset requests, it may indicate a hacking.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><b> Your phone is making secret calls and sending texts<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p>Hackers can remotely trigger a malware-infected phone to make secret calls and texts. By calling premium-rate phone numbers, they can rack up charges on your account – and you won’t know until the next bill comes in.

The <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/protect-elderly-online/\">elderly</a> might have built this great country, but they also are the demographic who struggle the most with new technology. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And even if you get them up to speed, tech trends change often.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and we&#8217;ve compiled a list of helpful tips for seniors that could help you bond over meaningful conversations during the long holiday weekend instead of ruining the holiday by spending your time straightening minor IT wrinkles on the often-dated devices of your <strong>not-so-tech-savvy relatives</strong>. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Ensure direct access</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably, the best way to troubleshoot a smartphone or a tablet is if you can connect directly and navigate the device remotely. Many solutions, such as <a href=\"https://www.teamviewer.com/en/\">TeamViewer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.logmein.com/\">LogMeIn</a>, allow you to take control of a device and help the individual resolve any tech difficulties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once set up, you won&#8217;t have to drive for an hour to help your boomer dad clear up a notification from his smartphone. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Facetime chat </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t forget the existence of live video. Unless you are starting from scratch, facetiming your loved ones could be a solution. Facetime is one of many options, as users can use Messages and even X (formerly known as Twitter), which just rolled out an audio and video calling feature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling live and going through troubleshooting steps could save you some money on gas. Having a device with the same OS handy makes assisting seniors with tech difficulties even easier.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Store classes</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that you don&#8217;t have to know and do it all. Tech shops owned by major wireless carriers such as ATT, T-Mobile, or Apple/Microsoft stores often offer free classes for people eager to navigate consumer electronics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They use those classes also to sell their products and solutions, so prepare your senior not to jump on every product pitched by the salesperson-in-disguise conducting the class.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Protection</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IT hiccups on consumer devices are sometimes caused by scammers. If the device is slower than usual or behaves abnormally, quite often, the reason is not a user error but a malicious code causing trouble in the background.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring your loved ones have installed anti-virus software is a great way to help them have fewer questions for you and browse safely. High-end consumer cyber security protection packages often come in many languages and alert seniors not to click on harmful links. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Necessary apps and amendments</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from having cyber security on any smartphone or tablet older people use, a few other tricks could help them enjoy their smart devices. Organizing the apps, adjusting the text size, and helping them sort out the &#8216;favorites&#8217; section in the contacts list (including people but also emergency numbers) are just a few things that could benefit older users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a fact that a retired powerplant operator with decades of experience could struggle to navigate simple apps like Messages.<br />\nSuch cases are sometimes amusing for youngsters as it is hard to believe that a senior or older employer who likely makes five times their salary needs education on adding an attachment to an email.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, we must remember that boomers and many Gen X folks grew up at times with minimal technology. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet became mainstream in the very late 20th century, and some seniors never had to use smart devices during their careers.   </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/remotely-it-support-elderly/\">How to remotely help an elderly relative struggling with a smartphone or a tablet?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/remotely-it-support-elderly/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"The pirates are back","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/online-piracy-back/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/online-piracy-back/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:23:26 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"apps"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"operating systems"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30562"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/piracy-back-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"online piracy back\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">We analyze a new study where the EUIPO suggests online piracy is on the increase within the European Union.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/online-piracy-back/\">The pirates are back</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/piracy-back-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"online piracy back\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /><p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new study from the European Union’s Intellectual Property Office <strong>(<a href=\"https://www.euipo.europa.eu/es\">EUIPO</a>)</strong> suggest that online piracy has increased for the first time in years. In fact, piracy rates have been falling for several years, so a reverse in that trend is significant.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What is online piracy?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the most basic level, online piracy is copying or stealing digital content. This could be music, video, software, ebooks or any other kind of content that should be paid for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, tools like Napster and Limewire allowed people to download music and video files for free – depriving artists of their income. The emergence of streaming services like Netflix, Apple Music and Spotify make it easy to access unlimited content – and ensure that artists are paid for their creations.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What happened?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New subscription services make it easier for people to access whatever digital content they want, when they want it. And because these services are relatively affordable, more people are choosing to pay for content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the EUIPO’s discovery that piracy has increased suggests that something has changed. According to their study, 48% of all piracy is caused by people illegally viewing TV content. 58% of pirates access illicit content via streaming sites while 32% download episodes from </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/security-info/bittorrent/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">torrent-based file sharing services</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What is the problem?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two main problems with digital piracy. First, it robs the creator of their income. It’s not just big companies who suffer – the people working behind the scenes lose out too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, piracy is illegal. Penalties for stealing digital content vary from country to country, but they can be quite harsh. In the UK, digital pirates face up to five years in prison and a £5000 GBP fine (~$6000).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the penalty, piracy is illegal and you could be prosecuted if convicted of accessing or stealing digital content.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What has changed?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUIPO speculates that financial pressures, like inflation, means that people have less money to spend on entertainment. This can be seen in the way that fewer people are signing up for Netflix or Amazon Prime – and some are even cancelling their subscriptions altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUIPO suggests that rather than stop watching digital content online, these people are now turning to illegal sources to access the TV shows they watch. And that is why piracy rates are on the up.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Adding some perspective</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s worth noting that although piracy is up, the rates are still far lower than they were 20, 10 or even five years ago. Whether people continue to access content illegally remains to be seen – hopefully this is just a ‘blip’ and rates of theft begin to fall again as the economy recovers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not, we can expect to see legal channels raising their prices again to cover the losses caused by piracy.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/online-piracy-back/\">The pirates are back</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/online-piracy-back/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"California goes rough on data brokers","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/california-rough-data-brokers/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/california-rough-data-brokers/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 08:43:37 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"protection"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30554"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/california-rough-data-brokers-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"California goes rough on data brokers\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">California legislators accepted amendments on specific aspects of the existing law to help Golden State residents easily scrub personal information from the internet.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/california-rough-data-brokers/\">California goes rough on data brokers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/california-rough-data-brokers-panda-security-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"California goes rough on data brokers\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /><h2><strong>California legislators accepted amendments on specific aspects of the existing Data Broker Registration law to help Golden State residents easily scrub personal information from the internet. </strong></h2>\n<p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new way for data agencies to address individual and business data deletion requests will be developed and managed by the <strong>California Privacy Protection Agency</strong> (CPPA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendments, also known as the </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delete Act (SB 362), </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will force data brokers to adhere to an accessible deletion mechanism, essentially allowing residents in the most populous state in the USA an easier way to request personal data deletion.

Some data brokers intentionally refused to provide a streamlined process for deletion requests in order to discourage the public from asking them to get rid of the collected data.</span></p>\n<h3>Ending the Monopoly of Data Deletion Agencies</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weak laws created a lucrative business model for data deletion agencies, which offer <strong>fair results</strong> but could be <strong>very pricey.</strong> A regular person who wants to take personal data off the internet would have to fork out hundreds, even in some cases thousands of dollars, to hire an agency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new law aims to end the need for people to go through costly agencies and strive to make data deletion services more <strong>DIY-friendly</strong>. A single submission would be enough for individuals who wish to take advantage of the Delete Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data brokers harvest publicly available information about individuals they don’t know personally. The collected data is often compiled into databases and sold to the highest bidder. Fraudsters often use such data to pick possible victims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more the criminals dig in, the more information they can collect to complete the critical data points puzzle and use the findings to commit crimes. </span></p>\n<h3>An eye on the future</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the bill just passed, it gives data brokers some breathing time as most of the new requirements will be enforced after the beginning of 2026. California is not the only state with strict regulations on data brokers, but past efforts to pass similar laws nationwide have failed on multiple occasions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Golden State’s recent effort and the ever-growing list of privacy concerns caused by data brokerage companies might indicate that a countrywide change might be on the way.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/california-rough-data-brokers/\">California goes rough on data brokers</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/california-rough-data-brokers/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"How to Stay Anonymous on the Internet in 12 Secure Steps","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/how-to-stay-anonymous-on-internet/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/how-to-stay-anonymous-on-internet/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"SIEGE"},"pubDate":"Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:33:16 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"Security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=30498"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/anonymous-on-internet-hero-300x225.webp\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"A woman sitting on the ground with a laptop.\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">The internet can be a fun and social experience, but it can also have a dark side.

In this digital age, protecting your information is more critical than ever. The web can leave you open to danger when your information is not protected, like malware and cybercriminals attempting to steal your identity. Whenever you shop online, browse a site or check your social media, websites track and collect data on your online preferences, search history and web activities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining online anonymity is a priority, as you are at constant risk of online tracking, surveillance and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/what-is-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data breaches</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when using the web. Staying anonymous online helps safeguard you from cyberattacks and keeps your online activities hidden from malicious hackers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it’s impossible to stay 100% anonymous online, we’ll cover 12 surefire steps to staying as anonymous on the internet as possible, ensuring your online activities remain private and secure.</span><b></b></p>\n<h2><b>1. Disable Browser Cookies</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-30533 size-full\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/disable-browser-cookies.webp\" alt=\"Illustration describing how to disable browser cookies.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/disable-browser-cookies.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/disable-browser-cookies-300x167.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/disable-browser-cookies-1280x711.webp 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/disable-browser-cookies-530x294.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cookies are tiny files that websites store on your computer to track your online actions, jeopardizing your privacy. You can increase your online anonymity by turning off cookies. By changing the settings, you can quickly disable cookies in common browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Doing this reduces the chance of online spying by stopping websites from gathering and tracking your data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To block cookies in Google Chrome, for example:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open Chrome</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the three vertical dots (kebab menu) in the top right corner</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click Settings, and a new window will open</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the Privacy and Security tab</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the Third-party cookies tab</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn on “Block third-party cookies.”</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional methods of hiding your online activity include switching to incognito mode in your browser or enabling a “do not track signal” under privacy and security. This will prevent websites from tracking your data but will still record your IP address. </span><b></b></p>\n<h2><b>2. Use an Ad Blocker</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ad blockers are browser add-ons that block invasive adverts, frequently hiding tracking cookies and scripts. By blocking these ads, you can prevent these sites from tracking your online actions. A proper ad blocker should be compatible across all browsing platforms like Chrome, Firefox and Safari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should effectively block pop-up ads and other features so hackers can’t access your computer or collect personal information without your consent.

Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30535\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/set-up-vpn.webp\" alt=\"Illustration explaining VPN.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/set-up-vpn.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/set-up-vpn-300x208.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/set-up-vpn-1280x889.webp 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/set-up-vpn-530x368.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A VPN, or virtual private network, is an effective tool for staying anonymous on the internet. It protects your online data and identity, allowing you to surf the web safely and privately. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A VPN hides your IP address by encrypting your internet connection and routing your traffic through a server in a different location, making it harder for anyone to track your online activity back to you. Although VPNs mask your online activity, they don’t ensure complete anonymity because some logging practices might still collect data. A </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/vpn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">premium VPN service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should have a strict no-log policy, meaning it doesn’t store your online activities or personal information.</span></p>\n<h2><b>4. Use Tor (The Onion Router)</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30539\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-tor-onion-router.webp\" alt=\"Illustration explaining Tor routing.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"740\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-tor-onion-router.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-tor-onion-router-300x154.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-tor-onion-router-1280x658.webp 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-tor-onion-router-530x272.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another method to conceal your online activity is using Tor, The Onion Router. Tor is a free online privacy browser that tunnels your traffic through a multi-server network, making it difficult for anyone to track your online behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Tor is an excellent tool for surfing anonymously, it can be slower than other browsers. Best of all, it’s easy to install and use To install Tor to your device, head to the official website and hit download based on your software. </span></p>\n<h2><b>5. Use Email and App Encryption Messaging</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30537\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools.webp\" alt=\"Illustration explaining email and messaging encryption tools.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1890\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools-300x394.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools-731x960.webp 731w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools-488x640.webp 488w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools-1170x1536.webp 1170w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-email-and-messaging-encryption-tools-530x696.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gmail, Mailvelope and WhatsApp have built-in encryption features that </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/tips/instant-messages-unhackable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make messages unhackable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by unauthorized users. Other platforms call for outside encryption services that work with your hardware or software. Many encryption services are free to use with compatible devices. </span></p>\n<h2><b>6. Use Privacy-Focused Search Engines and Browsers</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30538\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers.webp\" alt=\"Illustration explaining privacy-focused search engines and browsers.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1700\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers-300x354.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers-813x960.webp 813w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers-530x626.webp 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/use-privacy-focused-search-engines-and-browsers-1301x1536.webp 1301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private search engines like DuckDuckGo or Startpage do not track your online activities or store your search history. However, they cannot prevent websites from collecting data about you when you visit those sites directly. To prevent websites from collecting your data, take it a step further and adopt privacy-focused browsers like Brave or Mozilla Firefox, with built-in security features that restrict trackers and improve your online invisibility. </span></p>\n<h2><b>7. Secure Your Wi-Fi Connections</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30534\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/secure-wifi-connections.webp\" alt=\"Illustration depicting how to secure wifi connections.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1150\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/secure-wifi-connections.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/secure-wifi-connections-300x240.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/secure-wifi-connections-1202x960.webp 1202w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/secure-wifi-connections-530x423.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing your Wi-Fi is essential for online privacy and preventing a data invasion, which is unauthorized access to your network. Hackers can easily guess weak passwords like your name or hometown. To secure your Wi-Fi connection, create a strong password and implement WPA3 encryption, the latest Wi-Fi security update. These actions will protect you against potential online threats and conceal your online activities. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/how-to-create-strong-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a strong password</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is easier than you think. Follow these tips to ensure your passwords are hack-proof: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a mix of letters, numbers and symbols</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose long phrases with at least 11 characters</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid using your name or common words</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use password strength checkers</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of a strong password is: </span><b>ILov3P@ndaS3cur3ity55!</b></p>\n<h2><b>8. Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Information</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Wi-Fi networks, frequently offered at cafes, airports or hotels, lack proper security to safeguard your digital browsing. Viewing sensitive information like online banking details or personal login credentials in public can put your data at risk, making it easy for hackers to gain access. It’s best to avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities without a secure VPN connection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While public Wi-Fi networks can be risky, there are some situations where it’s safe to use them. Using a public Wi-Fi network is generally acceptable if you’re only accessing non-sensitive information, such as reading news articles or browsing regularly. Any activities that require a login like surfing social media should be done in a protected browser. However, it’s important to remain cautious and avoid viewing or sending sensitive data over these networks.</span></p>\n<h2><b>9. Keep Your Software Updated</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software updates are essential for safeguarding your information. The latest updates often include bug fixes, performance improvements and, most importantly, security patches. These patches address vulnerabilities cybercriminals could exploit to gain unauthorized access to your device or data. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple and Windows typically offer automatic updates monthly. Enable automatic updates under the settings tab on your device to minimize the risk of security breaches and maintain a secure online environment.</span></p>\n<h2><b>10. Use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS encrypts your data, preventing third-party access.  Check that the URL begins with https:// instead of http://. Using HTTPS protects your sensitive information from being exposed to potential eavesdroppers and maintains a secure online connection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To enable HTTPS sites in Chrome:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open Chrome</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the three vertical dots (kebab menu) in the top right corner</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click Settings, and a new window will open</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the Privacy and Security tab</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn on “Always use secure connections” under the Security tab</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>11. Limit Sharing Personal Information Online</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oversharing your personal information online means cybercriminals can use it for harmful purposes like impersonation, stealing your identity, opening accounts under your name or making large purchases. To reduce these risks, limit the personal information you share on platforms like social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid sharing sensitive details such as your home address, phone number and even names of family members, and review your privacy settings to control who can access your information. Keeping your personal information private can help lower the risk of identity theft and other privacy violations.</span></p>\n<h2><b>12. Be Cautious On Social Media</b></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30532\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/be-cautious-on-social-media.webp\" alt=\"Illustration depicting dangers and privacy tips for social media.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"950\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/be-cautious-on-social-media.webp 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/be-cautious-on-social-media-300x198.webp 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/be-cautious-on-social-media-1280x844.webp 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/10/be-cautious-on-social-media-530x350.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social networking sites have become hotbeds for data exploitation and privacy violations.

To protect your privacy and stay more anonymous online, consider minimizing what you share. Avoid personal information like names of family members,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide to keep using social media, be careful what you share and remember to check your privacy settings frequently. You regain control over your online privacy by taking control of your social media presence.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Happens When You Lack Online Privacy</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of internet privacy makes it easy for hackers to track your digital moves, leaving you susceptible to </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/brute-force-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cyberattacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Here are some commonly asked questions to consider:</span></p>\n<h3><b>Is It Possible to Be Completely Anonymous Online?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remaining 100% anonymous online is almost impossible for the average person. Achieving this level of privacy comes with many challenges and possibly investing in expensive tools that hide your IP address, disable your internet service provider (ISP) activity logs, erase your digital footprint and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While complete anonymity may be challenging, it is possible to strengthen your online privacy by using </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/benefits-of-a-vpn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beneficial tools like VPNs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, private search engines and encryption.</span></p>\n<h3><b>How Can I Browse Without Being Tracked?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three best ways to browse without being tracked are to implement a VPN, use a private search engine or enable a privacy-focused browser. All three methods are viable ways to protect yourself and stay hidden from online trackers. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Is Incognito Mode Anonymous?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Browsing in Incognito mode is not an anonymous activity. Incognito mode does not record your search or browsing history, but websites and search engines can still see your IP address and track your movements online. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Can You Erase Your Digital Footprint?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the average person, it is nearly impossible to erase your digital footprint due to the effort it would take to monitor and remove your online trail and linked data. However, you can decrease the amount of your information that is made publicly accessible by following the tips above.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Take Control of Your Online Privacy With Panda Security </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways to </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/tips/protect-personal-information/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protect your personal information online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and surf the web anonymously.

A major cyber incident crippled casino and hotel enterprise <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/cyberattac-caesars-hotel/\">Caesars Entertainment,</a> and MGM was forced to shut down computers and some slot machines for days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attack on MGM Resorts affected basic computer systems and damaged telephone networks, hotel systems, casino systems, key systems, and elevators. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_Spider\">Scattered Spider</a>, an affiliation of BlackCat/ALPHV/Noberus, claimed responsibility for the attack.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Divergent Strategies: Ceasars versus MGM </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cybercriminals managed to get the infrastructure of the multibillion-dollar business to its knees and caused damages worth tens of millions of dollars. However, William Hornbuckle, CEO of MGM Resorts International, said that he refused to give in to the fraudsters, and MGM did not pay the ransom requested by the criminals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an entirely different strategy to deal with threat actors compared to Ceasars’ management, which managed to get things going fairly quick after paying a negotiated $15 million ransom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while Ceasar’s was back in the game in days, MGM Resorts International took a bit longer, which undoubtedly meant they would generate more losses because of the attack. MGM is a Fortune 500 company with a $10+ billion annual revenue &#8211; there is no way crippling such a colossal company won’t negatively impact the business. The loss may not be a lot for the business itself, but it is an enormous number. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MGM stated that it estimates a negative impact from the cyber security issue to be approximately $100 million. This excludes the roughly $10 million MGM paid to cyber security companies to clean up the mess left by the hackers. </span></p>\n<p><b>MGM will likely incur an initial loss of about $110 million.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This number excludes the possible outcome of multiple lawsuits triggered after the attack became public. The class action lawsuits will likely cause additional losses for MGM as concerned individuals believe that the casino giant did not do enough to protect their personal data. </span></p>\n<h3>MGM&#8217;s Resilience: Learning from the Cyber Attack and Strengthening Its Defenses</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a positive note, the giant was well insured against cyber-attacks, and the insurance company will probably be the one to cover the damages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MGM expects next year’s cyber security insurance to be through the roof but vouched to improve its cyber security so they don’t have to use the insurance policy again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hotel giant has begun addressing the issues that allowed the hackers to social-engineer their way into MGM’s systems and appears to be keen to invest in further development of infrastructure, people, and processes. Hence, the company is more prepared for such attacks in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mgm-cyber-attack/\">How much money did MGM lose due to last month’s cyber-attack?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mgm-cyber-attack/feed/","slash:comments":"0"}]}}}
