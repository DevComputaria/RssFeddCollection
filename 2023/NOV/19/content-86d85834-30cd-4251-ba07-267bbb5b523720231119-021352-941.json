While commissioners congratulated themselves for the move, there’s little reason yet to believe it will stop a practice that has been all too common over the past decade.</p>\n<p>The scams, known as \"SIM swapping\" and \"port-out fraud,\" both have the same objective: to wrest control of a cell phone number away from its rightful owner by tricking the employees of the carrier that services it. SIM swapping occurs when crooks hold themselves out as someone else and request that the victim's number be transferred to a new SIM card—usually under the pretense that the victim has just obtained a new phone. In port-out scams, crooks do much the same thing, except they trick the carrier employee into transferring the target number to a new carrier.</p>\n<p>This class of attack has existed for well over a decade, and it became more commonplace amid the irrational exuberance that drove up the price of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. People storing large sums of digital coin have been frequent targets. Once crooks take control of a phone number, they trigger password resets that work by clicking on links sent in text messages. The crooks then drain cryptocurrency and traditional bank accounts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985061#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985061&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/the-fcc-says-new-rules-will-curb-sim-swapping-im-pessimistic/feed/","slash:comments":"58"},{"title":"Details emerge of surprise board coup that ousted CEO Sam Altman at OpenAI","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985097","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Benj Edwards"},"pubDate":"Sat, 18 Nov 2023 14:24:52 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"ChatGPT"},{"#cdata-section":"chatgtp"},{"#cdata-section":"GPT-4"},{"#cdata-section":"greg brockman"},{"#cdata-section":"Ilya Sutskever"},{"#cdata-section":"large language models"},{"#cdata-section":"machine learning"},{"#cdata-section":"microsoft"},{"#cdata-section":"Mira Murari"},{"#cdata-section":"non-profit"},{"#cdata-section":"openai"},{"#cdata-section":"sam altman"},{"#cdata-section":"Satya Nadella"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985097"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Microsoft CEO \"furious\"; OpenAI President and 3 researchers resign.

To use a remote desktop connection, the Windows instance you're connecting to must be running a Pro edition, as Home lacks the ability to host a remote desktop connection.

The credentials make it easy for the underlying program to access databases or cloud services necessary for it to work as intended.

One or more developers for the ride service had embedded a unique security key into code and then shared that code on a public GitHub page.

In March this year, Microsoft announced <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/06/introducing-microsoft-dynamics-365-copilot/\">Dynamics 365 Copilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-ai-features\">Copilot in Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/28/introducing-microsoft-security-copilot-empowering-defenders-at-the-speed-of-ai/\">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, and <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>. Now Bing Chat is just \"Microsoft Copilot\"—its sixth copilot so far. Pretty soon, Microsoft will need a Branding Copilot to keep them all straight.</p>\n<p>Regarding the naming scheme, Microsoft customer Amit Malik took to X and <a href=\"https://x.com/amit_malik99/status/1704918893993857445?s=20\">wrote</a>, \"I love Microsoft, but this whole copilot thing is becoming more confusing than it should be. Microsoft Copilot, Windows Copilot, M365 Copilot, then all the m365 apps, D365 copilot and so on.

When creators upload content, YouTube will provide new options to indicate if the content includes realistic AI-generated or AI-altered material. \"For example, this could be an AI-generated video that realistically depicts an event that never happened, or content showing someone saying or doing something they didn't actually do,\" YouTube writes.</p>\n<p>In the detailed announcement, Jennifer Flannery O'Connor and Emily Moxley, vice presidents of product management at YouTube, explained that the policy update aims to maintain a positive ecosystem in the face of generative AI. \"We believe it’s in everyone’s interest to maintain a healthy ecosystem of information on YouTube,\" they write. \"We have long-standing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10834785?hl=en\">policies</a> that prohibit technically manipulated content that misleads viewers ...

Once triggered, the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior, most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine, which, under most cloud security models, is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.</p>\n<h2>Very strange behavior</h2>\n<p>The bug, tracked under the common name Reptar and the designation CVE-2023-23583, is related to how affected CPUs manage prefixes, which change the behavior of instructions sent by running software. Intel x64 decoding generally allows redundant prefixes—meaning those that don’t make sense in a given context—to be ignored without consequence. During testing in August, Ormandy noticed that the <code>REX</code> prefix was generating “unexpected results” when running on Intel CPUs that support a newer feature known as fast short repeat move, which was introduced in the Ice Lake architecture to fix microcoding bottlenecks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983867#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983867&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/intel-fixes-high-severity-cpu-bug-that-causes-very-strange-behavior/feed/","slash:comments":"40"},{"title":"AI outperforms conventional weather forecasting for the first time: Google study","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983760","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/ai-outperforms-conventional-weather-forecasting-for-the-first-time-google-study/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Benj Edwards"},"pubDate":"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 19:53:14 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"Google"},{"#cdata-section":"Science"},{"#cdata-section":"AI forecasting"},{"#cdata-section":"ecmwf"},{"#cdata-section":"google"},{"#cdata-section":"google deepmind"},{"#cdata-section":"GraphCast"},{"#cdata-section":"hurricanes"},{"#cdata-section":"machine learning"},{"#cdata-section":"meteorology"},{"#cdata-section":"science"},{"#cdata-section":"Weather"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983760"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"AI models may soon enable more accurate forecasts with higher speed and lower cost."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiona_weather_hero-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"A file photo of Tropical storm Fiona as seen in a satellite image from 2022.\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiona_weather_hero.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"675\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A file photo of Tropical Storm Fiona as seen in a satellite image from 2022.

If widely deployed, it could lead to far more powerful AI models—and faster response times for existing ones like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a>—in the near future.</p>\n<p>According to experts, lack of computing power (often called \"compute\") has been a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/06/tech/ai-chips-supply-chain/index.html\">major bottleneck</a> of AI progress this past year, hindering deployments of existing AI models and slowing the development of new ones. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/openai-may-jump-into-ai-hardware-amid-high-costs-supply-constraints/\">Shortages</a> of powerful GPUs that accelerate AI models are largely to blame. One way to alleviate the compute bottleneck is to make more chips, but you can also make AI chips more powerful. That second approach may make the H200 an attractive product for cloud providers.</p>\n\n<p>What's the H200 good for? Despite the \"G\" in the \"GPU\" name, data center GPUs like this typically aren't for graphics. GPUs are ideal for AI applications because they perform vast numbers of parallel matrix multiplications, which are necessary for neural networks to function. They are essential in the training portion of building an AI model and the \"inference\" portion, where people feed inputs into an AI model and it returns results.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983396#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983396&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/nvidia-introduces-its-most-powerful-gpu-yet-designed-for-accelerating-ai/feed/","slash:comments":"73"}]}}}
