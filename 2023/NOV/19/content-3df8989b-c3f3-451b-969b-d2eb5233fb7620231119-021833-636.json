Cisco would like to highlight the following key facts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\">The most prevalent initial access vector in these attacks involves stolen or weak administrative credentials. As outlined in the report, certain configuration changes, such as disabling logging and downloading firmware, require administrative credentials.</li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\">There is no indication that any Cisco vulnerabilities were exploited. Attackers used compromised credentials to perform administrative-level configuration and software changes.</li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\">Modern Cisco devices include secure boot capabilities, which do not allow the loading and executing of modified software images. For more information on secure boot, see the <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/trustworthy-technologies-datasheet.pdf\">Cisco Trustworthy Technologies Data Sheet</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>The stolen code-signing certificates mentioned in the report are not from Cisco. Cisco does not have any knowledge of code-signing certificates being stolen to perform any attack against Cisco infrastructure devices.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These key points align with the Cisco consistent stance and messaging that advises customers to follow best practices as described in the Cisco blog post: <a href=\"https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-blogs/attackers-continue-to-target-legacy-devices/ba-p/4169954\">Attackers Continue to Target Legacy Devices</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Modern network infrastructure devices now contain numerous security features and capabilities that mitigate the aforementioned attacks. The Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) applies industry-leading practices and technology to build trustworthy solutions that have fewer field-discovered product security incidents. As part of our ongoing commitment to network reliability, Cisco has recently launched an effort focused on network resiliency.
