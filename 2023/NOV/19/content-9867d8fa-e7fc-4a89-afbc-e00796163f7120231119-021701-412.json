Recent project reports from the NCCoE include mappings of relevant IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities; these three mappings align NIST’s IoT cybersecurity guidance with real-world implementation approaches: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem Securing\n\n","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Jeff Marron","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"true","#text":"https://www.nist.gov/node/1700611"}},{"title":"A Peek at Privacy: Where We Started, Where We are Now, and What’s Next","link":"https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/peek-privacy-where-we-started-where-we-are-now-and-whats-next","description":"  As part of NIST’s 50 th anniversary of cybersecurity, this month’s blog post is centered on privacy at NIST. Since many of you have become familiar with the Privacy Engineering Program ’s popular Venn diagram showing the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy risks, let’s use it to show how NIST has expanded and matured its understanding of privacy over the last 50 years. If we go back in time to the 1960s, data privacy really came into focus when the growing use of computers created concerns about secret databases of people’s information. The report, Records, Computers, and the Rights\n\n","pubDate":"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Meghan Anderson","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"true","#text":"https://www.nist.gov/node/1699526"}},{"title":"NIST Seeks Input on International Aspects of the Cybersecurity Framework, Other Resources","link":"https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/nist-seeks-input-international-aspects-cybersecurity-framework-other","description":"  Addressing global needs is a critical part of NIST’s work in the evolution of the Cybersecurity Framework, especially as we continue to see international adaptions and use cases to address emerging risks. Recently translated into French and Ukrainian , the Framework is now available in 10 languages , and additional translations are in the works. With a growing user base around the world, the Framework is primed for an update that draws more deeply on international viewpoints.

In this look back, Rodney offers a brief history of NICE, discusses recent advances in cybersecurity education and workforce development, and shares a few memories from around the community. In this year-long celebration of cybersecurity at NIST, we at the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) are proud to be the first to take a detailed look at some of the advances that have taken place to address\n\n","pubDate":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Rodney Petersen","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"true","#text":"https://www.nist.gov/node/1697931"}},{"title":"Celebrating 50 Years of Cybersecurity at NIST!","link":"https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/celebrating-50-years-cybersecurity-nist","description":"  With each day bringing new cybersecurity challenges and advances, it is easy to understand why people feel like it’s hard to keep up. It is important to be agile and move quickly to avoid the consequences of cybersecurity attacks—and that need extends to government agencies, like NIST, as we work collaboratively with industry, academia, and government to help meet these challenges. Those of us at NIST realize that we have a responsibility to keep an eye on current needs AND on potential future needs including changes in technologies and threats that could affect the ability of organizations to\n\n","pubDate":"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Kevin Stine","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"true","#text":"https://www.nist.gov/node/1696471"}},{"title":"Our Quest: Advancing Product Labels to Help Consumers Consider Cybersecurity","link":"https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/our-quest-advancing-product-labels-help-consumers-consider","description":"  For many decades, consumers have relied on labels to help them make decisions about which products to buy. Sometimes the labels make assertions about what ingredients or components the product uses. ( What’s in that peanut butter? ) Other times labels claim a level of performance. ( How much storage does that laptop have? ) These statements may come from the manufacturer or from a third party who has reviewed and perhaps tested the product.
