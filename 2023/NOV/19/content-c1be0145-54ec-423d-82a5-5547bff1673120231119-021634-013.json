on a northern Gaza refugee camp, including a UN school used as a shelter for people displaced by the Israel-Hamas war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables in Jabalia, the Palestinian territory's biggest refugee camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 attacks which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians in southern Israel, and saw about 240 people taken hostage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The army's relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government which has ruled Gaza since 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"At least 50 people\" were killed in a dawn strike on the UN-run Al-Fakhura school in the camp, which has been converted into a shelter for displaced Palestinians, a health ministry official in Hamas-controlled Gaza told AFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to UN figures, some 1.6 million people have been displaced inside the Gaza Strip by six weeks of fighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths denounced the \"tragic news of the children, women and men killed\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Shelters are a place for safety,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Civilians cannot and should not have to bear this any longer.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Egypt called the bombing of the UN-run school a \"war crime\" and \"a deliberate insult to the United Nations\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A separate strike Saturday on another building in Jabalia camp killed 32 people from the same family, 19 of them children, the Hamas official said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said \"an incident in the Jabalia region\" was under review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has told Palestinians to move from north Gaza for their safety, but deadly air strikes continued to hit central and southern areas of the coastal enclave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Saturday, hundreds of people fled on foot after the director of Gaza's main hospital said the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of the facility where some 2,000 people were trapped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columns of sick and injured -- some of them amputees -- were seen making their way out of Al-Shifa hospital towards the seafront without ambulances along with displaced people, doctors and nurses, as loud explosions were heard around the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way, an AFP journalist saw at least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, along a road lined by heavily damaged shops and overturned vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The health ministry said 120 wounded, along with an unspecified number of premature babies, were still at Al-Shifa hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has been pressing military operations inside the hospital, searching for the Hamas operations centre it says lies under the sprawling complex -- a charge Hamas denies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>'Patients cannot leave'</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Gaza City, Israeli troops had called over loudspeakers to evacuate Al-Shifa \"in the next hour\", an AFP journalist at the hospital reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also called the hospital's director, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, telling him to ensure \"the evacuation of patients, wounded, the displaced and medical staff\", he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Israel's army denied ordering the evacuation, saying instead it had \"acceded to the request of the director\" to allow more civilians to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a doctor at the hospital, \"most of the medical staff and patients had left\" but he was staying at Al-Shifa along with five other doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Many patients cannot leave the hospital as they are in the ICU beds or the baby incubators,\" Mokhallalati said on X.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has imposed a siege on Gaza, allowing just a trickle of aid in from Egypt but barring most shipments of fuel over concerns Hamas could divert supplies for military purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first consignment of fuel entered the territory after Israel's war cabinet bowed to pressure from its ally the United States and agreed to let in two tankers of diesel a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A two-day blackout caused by fuel shortages ended after a first delivery arrived from Egypt late Friday, but UN officials continued to plead for a ceasefire, warning no part of Gaza is safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strike on a residential building in southern Gaza killed 26 people, the director of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I was asleep and we were surprised by the strike. At least 20 bombs were dropped,\" Imed al-Mubasher, 45, told AFP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UN said Israel had agreed to allow in 60,000 litres (16,000 gallons) of fuel a day from Saturday, but warned it was little more than a third of what is needed to keep hospitals, water and sanitation facilities running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Joe Biden's chief adviser for the Middle East said more fuel deliveries and a potential \"significant pause\" in the fighting both depend of the release of hostages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The surge in humanitarian relief, the surge in fuel, the pause... will come when hostages are released,\" Brett McGurk told a security conference in Bahrain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Biden wants Gaza, West Bank 'reunited'</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The military says it has found rifles, ammunition, explosives and the entrance to a tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa hospital complex, claims that cannot be independently verified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel has not recovered hostages at the hospital but said it found not far away the bodies of two kidnapped women including a soldier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those held hostage range from infants to octogenarians, and there has been little information on their fate despite ongoing negotiations mediated by Qatar and Egypt to secure releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waving Israeli flags and placards depicting the hostages, thousands of people reached Jerusalem Saturday on the fifth and final day of a march calling for their release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Israel says it would not allow Hamas to hold on to power in Gaza, Biden argued the coastal enclave and the occupied West Bank -- nominally under the control of the Palestinian Authority -- should eventually come under a single \"revitalised\" administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"As we strive for peace, Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalised Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution,\" Biden wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>"},"media:content":{"@url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-07/9hpkbdig_israel-gaza_625x300_16_July_22.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@expression":"full","@width":"538","@height":"190","media:description":{"@type":"plain","#cdata-section":"A Hamas health official said more than 80 people were killed Saturday.

Don't commit adultery. What I learned at that time, is that these values are familiar to me. They don't belong to Hindus. But, they don't belong to Christians either. They belong to God actually. And I think these are the values that undergird this country,\" Mr Ramaswamy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added, \"Can I be a President who can promote Christianity across the country? I can't...I don't think that's what we should want a US President to do either...but will I stand for those shared values? Will I promote them in the examples that we set for the next generations? You are damn right, I will!
