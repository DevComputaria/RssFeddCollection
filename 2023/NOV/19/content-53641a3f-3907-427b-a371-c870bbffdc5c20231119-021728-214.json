But without appropriate processes in place, that figure could be much higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s why experts recommend a layered approach to cyber security, which includes the steps organisations take after an incident has occurred as well as traditional measures designed to prevent data breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework is known as defence in depth, and it contains five interrelated stages. Even if one of these defensive layers is breached, the next works to further contain the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we look at how you can recover from cyber attacks by taking a defence-in-depth approach to information security.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is threat recovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When all other lines of defence fail, you need to ensure your organisation can survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, you will be able to restore enough critical services to be able to continue functioning, but it can take months to fully return to business as usual. In the meantime, you need a plan for how you will manage, plus you need appropriate resources to implement those plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a start, you need business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Business continuity is about ensuring that your organisation continues to operate in the event of disruption. It’s a way of temporarily addressing a problem until you’re able to address the underlying issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, say your office is flooded. A business continuity plan would outline how to secure your important assets and how to ensure staff can continue to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, disaster recovery is the process of resolving the disruption. At its most basic level, it involves identifying the source of the incident and finding a way to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plans are usually very technical and focus on specific deadlines that must be met to prevent catastrophic damage. It will include things such as RTOs (recovery time objectives), which are estimates of how long it will take for a product, service or activity to become available following an incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comprehensive documentation ensures that the organisation is prepared for whatever happens, but implementing these plans can be expensive. This is where cyber insurance helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Policies provide organisations with the means to implement incident response measures, such as forensic investigation, legal assistance and public relations support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These activities aren’t typically included in standard business insurance policies, which usually only cover costs related to technical issues, such as corrupted hard drives and lost devices.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How we can help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your resources or expertise, a defence-in-depth approach to cyber security will give you the best chance of mitigating the security risks your organisation faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enables you to focus on your core business objectives without having to worry about coming under attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT Governance has everything you need.

Rather, attackers take advantage of the limitations of computer networks, overwhelming them until traffic is unable to be processed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can think of it like a traffic jam: roads are designed to enable a certain amount of traffic to pass through, but once they become overcrowded, cars must slow down or stop altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are ways to mitigate the risk of some DoS attacks, as we explain below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of DoS attack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two primary ways to conduct a DoS attack – flooding and crashing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flooding attacks are most common, and work by saturating the targeted server with packets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are segments of data that you send to the organisation’s network when you interact with its website, which are then reassembled to perform tasks or load information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the network receives too many of these packets in a short period of time, the network struggles to reassemble the data. As a result, service will be disrupted or the website will be forced offline altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, an attacker might crash an organisation’s website by exploiting vulnerabilities in its network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, they might leverage misconfigured network device by sending spoofed packets to every device on the target network rather than one specific machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network is then triggered to amplify the traffic, in what is known as a smurf attack or ping of death.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Attacker motivation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The question that surrounds DoS attacks is what motivates a criminal hacker to do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all forms of cyber crime are designed to make money, but this isn’t possible with a DoS attack alone. An attackers’ motivation, therefore, can be much harder to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason for launching an attack is because they hold a grudge against the target. Many DoS attacks are politically or ideologically motivated, with the attacker holding a grievance against their target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack could cost the organisation money if services are disrupted during the attack. The damage could also damage the organisation’s reputation, particularly if they are responsible for providing critical services of a time-sensitive nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, cyber criminals might also bring down a service simply to show off their skills to the hacking community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high-profile attack can act as a calling card to other criminals to demonstrate their capabilities or to show off what they’re capable of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, there are occasions when a DoS is used as a distraction while the criminal hacker launches a second attack designed to compromise an organisation’s systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victim might be so focused on restoring its systems from the first attack that it doesn’t notice other security alerts related to unauthorised access to its systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">DoS attacks versus DDoS attack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A related attack is DDoS (distributed denial of service). This works in the same way as a DoS attack, but uses multiple systems to launch a synchronised attack on a single target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the attack isn’t coming from a single computer operated by the attacker but from several computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyber criminals do this with the help of a botnet, which is a series of infected Internet-connected devices that harvests their processing power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, DDoS attacks are far more powerful and sustained than a standard DoS attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DDoS attacks are also harder for the victim to identify, with malicious network traffic spread across locations and masked within legitimate traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you know you’ve suffered a DoS attack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious sign of a DoS attack is prolonged network problems. However, there are other signs to look out for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<li>A higher volume of spam than normal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sudden loss of connectivity across devices on the same network.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slow website performance, with pages failing to load.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Staff being unable to open files stored on the network or when accessing websites.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to prevent a DoS attack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s difficult to prevent DoS attacks, but there are steps you can take to mitigate the threat. Here are three ways to get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.&nbsp; Increase your bandwidth</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest thing you can do is to buy more bandwidth. This enables you to handle a larger amount of traffic, reducing the risk of bottlenecks that could disrupt your service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a particularly attractive solution to growing companies, as it also helps them process an increased amount of legitimate traffic and is something they might have to do eventually anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only downside is that increasing your bandwidth won’t protect you from crashing attacks, which exploit system weaknesses instead of flooding your server.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.  Build more complex servers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You should consider spreading your servers across multiple data centres to make it as hard as possible for cyber criminals to target you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These servers should ideally be in different locations, either spread across different premises or in different countries altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this strategy to work, you’ll need a load balancing system to distribute traffic between servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separating your servers this way means that criminals face an uphill task to flood your systems. Their attack may compromise one server, but the rest will be unaffected and should be capable of taking on at least some of the extra traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.  Reconfigure your network hardware</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You should adjust or strengthen your hardware configurations to reduce the risk of malicious traffic getting through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, your network and web application firewalls can be modified to check incoming packets against predefined rules (such as allow/deny protocols, ports and IP addresses) and block incoming malicious traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to check how prepared you are for a DoS attack is with a <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/penetration-testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">penetration test</a>. This is essentially a controlled form of hacking in which a professional tester uses the same techniques as a criminal hacker in an attempt to exploit your systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the tester will try to flood your systems or exploit vulnerabilities that cripple your servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should they be successful, the tester will provide detailed notes on how the attack was possible and advice on how to mitigate the threat.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/combined-external-infrastructure-and-web-application-penetration-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5.png\" alt=\"IT Governance Combined External Infrastructure and Web Application Penetration Test\" class=\"wp-image-44395\" width=\"190\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5.png 320w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-300x300.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-65x65.png 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, we recommend our <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/combined-infrastructure-and-web-application-penetration-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Combined Infrastructure and Web Application Penetration Test</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our CREST-certified penetration testers will conduct a thorough examination of your networks, websites and web applications to determine how an attacker could target you and what you can do to stop them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/combined-infrastructure-and-web-application-penetration-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Get started</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:23px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to know more?

Much has been made of ChatGPT and the ability for artificial general intelligence to radically alter or replace a variety of content-based roles, from writing to coding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Mark Zuckerberg is insistent that the <a href=\"https://www.grcilaw.com/blog/is-the-metaverse-relevant-to-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">metaverse can reshape workplace collaboration</a> in an era of remote working, while other business leaders look for practical solutions to the challenges that a post-pandemic world presents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can teams talk and share information productively? Will remote workers suffer from their isolation in the long term?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid all this, organisations continue to struggle in their attempts to find skilled personnel to oversee these practices. It’s all well and good automating processes, but you still need people who know what they’re doing to manage your requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an issue among many industries, but it’s particularly acute in the cyber security sector – where the growing use of technology has propelled a demand for expertise that far outstrips the number of people entering or advancing their position in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mounting danger</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The concerns regarding the cyber skills gap was neatly summarised in a recent <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/04/how-reskilling-and-upskilling-talent-shrink-cybersecurity-skills-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Economic Forum article</a> written by Rob Rashotte, the vice president of global training and technical field enablement at Fortinet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted that “short-staffed security teams and those lacking senior-level professionals make it difficult for organizations – regardless of industry or sector – to safeguard their assets from threats, resulting in tangible consequences”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rashotte pointed to <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/reports/2023-cybersecurity-skills-gap-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a Fortinet report</a> that found 80% of organisations fell victim to a cyber attack last year, 48% of which said that sensitive data had been stolen. In those instances, organisations spent $1 million (£800,000) on average remediating the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is expected to worsen, as organisations’ increased use of technology creates more opportunities for cyber criminals to strike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have already seen a <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-quarterly-review-q1-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">12.7% rise in publicly reported data breaches</a> in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous three months, and many organisations are expecting a barrage of attacks – which might include potentially devastating fallout from growing geopolitical instability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Security_Outlook_Report_2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The World Economic Forum’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2023 report</a> found that 86% of business leaders and 93% of security leaders believe that growing political tensions – which often play out in cyberspace – could lead to a catastrophic cyber event within the next two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worrying prediction comes alongside a warning from the new deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, who said that <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/russia-linked-cyber-attack-groups-want-to-destroy-uk-minister-warns-12860186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UK businesses are on the frontline of the country’s cyber security defences</a> and they must defend against cyber criminals who intend to destroy critical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at the CyberUK conference in Belfast, Dowden said that these groups are “ideologically motivated rather than financially motivated” and their goal is to “disrupt or destroy” their targets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The criminals he’s referring to are most likely Russian state-sponsored hackers, who have consistently targeted the country’s political adversaries since the invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responding to these threats, the National Cyber Security Centre has issued an official threat notice to help protect the county, while Dowden told the conference he was urging “companies in charge of keeping our country running, of keeping the lights on [to] take their own security seriously”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “A bricks-and-mortar business wouldn&#8217;t survive if it left the back door open to criminals every night.

Malicious insiders act deliberately, and they often use the same techniques as criminal hackers, such as planting malware or exploiting an unprotected database.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, negligent insiders act carelessly but have no intent to harm the organisation. They can cause data breaches and other forms of disruption by mistakenly damaging the organisation’s systems or by enabling a cyber criminal to act.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Within this dyad, insider threats can be further divided into three types.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Financially motivated malicious insiders</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Security experts often say that ‘personal data is the new currency’. That’s a slight exaggeration (good luck trying to pay rent with your email address), but the point remains: legitimate organisations and cyber criminals alike are trying to get their hands on personal data.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, many business activities are designed with information-gathering potential in mind, while cyber criminals want personal information to commit fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Personal data is therefore abundant within organisations and extremely valuable to cyber criminals. An employee hoping to make some extra cash is liable to take that information and sell it on the dark web.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As with crime generally, the two biggest obstacles that prevent people from doing this are their moral compass and their fear of being caught. These factors don’t go away just because you’re dealing with virtual loot and a faceless buyer over the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But things can change if you put someone in the wrong circumstance. There are countless examples of people who have turned to crime when they need money or they want more.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They might know their actions are wrong but tell themselves that there’s no other option and what they’re doing isn’t that bad. Or that it’s a one-time thing, or a victimless crime.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These motivations are much easier to reconcile with one’s sense of right and wrong when it comes to cyber crime, because the culprit isn’t causing any damage directly. They are, in effect, a middleman, and the knock-on effects of their actions aren’t immediately obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Vengeful malicious insiders</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Business is full of tough decisions, and that sometimes means employees feel hard done by. Perhaps they have been turned down for a promotion or a pay rise, or they feel as though they have been treated poorly by their boss.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Or, in the most common instance of vengeful malicious insiders, they have been fired or forced out. This kind of insider is particularly dangerous if they can log in to their work account remotely and the organisation doesn’t remove their access rights immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s because the employee will be acting on emotion, recklessly sabotaging the organisation without considering the consequences of their actions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A more subtle form of this occurs when perpetrators are unhappy with their employer but are otherwise getting on with their work.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These types of attacks will usually be more thought out and harder to detect. The perpetrator will take a more deliberate approach and could involve personal gain, such as embezzling money or stealing information to sell on the dark web.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, they might simply want the organisation to suffer, for example by shutting down business processes or redirecting information.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Negligent insider</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Negligent insiders don’t set out to cause damage, but that doesn’t make them any less dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They pose a problem because they make mistakes while performing normal work duties. This might be because they don’t understand the rules or the organisation doesn’t have properly defined processes and policies in place.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, they might simply be tired or slip-up due to a lapse in concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Their actions might result directly in a data breach, such as emailing sensitive files to the wrong person. Or they can make an error that creates opportunities for malicious actors to pounce, such as inadvertently allowing an unauthorised person into the building.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why do they pose a threat?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Insider threats can result in a range of negative outcomes, from the theft of sensitive data and unauthorised access to the sabotage of their systems and equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In every case, insider threats can jeopardise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information and systems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Confidentiality refers to an organisation’s ability to keep sensitive information private and secure. Whether they’re acting maliciously or negligently, an insider is liable to leak information to a third party. They might hand the information to a cyber criminal or a rival firm, or leak it publicly online.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Integrity refers to the completeness and accuracy of data, as well as the organisation’s ability to protect it from corruption. Insiders could deliberately or inadvertently tamper with information in order to disrupt its operations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Availability refers to an organisation’s ability to access information when needed. For example, this could happen if an insider damages the organisation’s server or deletes information from its Cloud systems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The risks presented by negligent insiders are, by definition, harder to define. They aren’t operating with malicious intent, so it’s impossible to say exactly what outcome their actions will have.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The best-case scenario is that the vulnerability caused by their negligence is spotted before any adverse consequences occur. However, in organisations where information security practices are lacking, continuous mistakes could result in long-running and extensive-ranging breaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of insider threats</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Theft of trade secrets</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The US multinational company General Electric learned in July 2022 that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndny/pr/former-ge-engineer-sentenced-24-months-conspiring-steal-trade-secrets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">an employee had stolen more than 8,000 sensitive files</a>&nbsp;in a breach that spanned more than eight years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An engineer at the firm, Jean Patrice Delia, had persuaded an IT administrator to grant him access to sensitive information, which he siphoned off with the intention of starting a rival company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI investigated the incident and learned that Delia emailed commercially sensitive information to a co-conspirator. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to up to 87 months in prison.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Phishing</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phishing is perhaps the biggest cyber security risk that organisations face, with organisations of all sizes and in all sectors being at risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The NHS learned that to its cost this year, after more than 130 email accounts were compromised in a prolonged phishing campaign.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252516702/NHS-email-accounts-hijacked-for-phishing-campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Cloud security firm Inky found</a> that scammers sent 1,157 phishing emails originating from NHS mail between October 2021 and March 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The emails contained a link that directed to a bogus Microsoft 365 login page, asking them to provide their login details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Inky reported that at least 139 NHS emails were compromised in the attack, but the true scope of the campaign was likely much larger, because the organisation only analysed phishing attacks made against its own customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Sabotage</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A system administrator who lost his job at a paper mill served 34 months in prison after tampering with the control systems of his former employer and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_7f6ea818-f488-11e6-bada-eb1757011f89.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">causing $1.1 million (about £900,000) in damages</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Johnson, who had been made redundant by the paper manufacturer Georgia-Pacific after 15 years’ service, was able to use login credentials that remained valid. He accessed servers via a VPN in his home, installing his own software and altering the industrial control systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In a two-week-long attack on the firm’s factory in Port Hudson, Louisiana, Johnson created a series of delays that cost his former employer huge sums in missed deadlines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Financially motivated</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2022, a Taco Bell employee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wmbfnews.com/2022/06/22/hartsville-taco-bell-worker-accused-credit-card-identity-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was caught stealing customers’ credit card details</a>&nbsp;and using the numbers to buy items for herself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Police were called after a victim reported that someone had tried to use their credit card at a nearby Pizza Hut.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The investigation soon led to 36-year-old Laquawanda Hawkins, who worked in Taco Bell’s drive-thru. CCTV footage revealed that she had taken photographs of customers bank cards and used the information to make a series of purchases locally and online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Internal error</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pegasus Airline accidentally left 23 million files containing personal data exposed online after an employee improperly configured a database.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cybersecurity/pegasus-airline-data-breach-aws-bucket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The incident was reported in June 2022</a>&nbsp;after the Turkish airline discovered the error.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Organisations often use third-party services to store sensitive information, because it saves them money and resources. With a Cloud service provider, the data is stored on a central server that can be accessed online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Because the information is stored online, organisations must adopt appropriate controls to ensure that only authorised people can access the information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, an employee misconfigured the security settings, exposing valuable information such as fight charts, navigation materials and information data of flight crew.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The database also contained up to 400 files with plaintext passwords and secret keys, as well as the source code for the software.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to detect an insider threat</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you’re trying to spot malicious or negligent behaviour, the best way to detect insider threats is to keep an eye out for employees acting abnormally.<strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Behavioural indicators</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If an employee appears to be dissatisfied at work, they might act less professionally in person and in correspondences. Likewise, the quality of their work might decline and they may show other signs of insubordination, such as turning up to work late or leaving early.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Suspicious behaviour can also include working at unusual times. If an employee logs in to their systems in the middle of the night, it suggests they are doing something that they don’t want their employer to know about.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They might also take a more cavalier attitude towards work and their professional standards. An insider threat might talk often about how much they dislike their job and make reference to the fact they are planning or hoping to quit.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Digital indicators</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If there is a large volume of traffic, it might indicate that the employee is copying sensitive information to a personal hard drive, which they can use for fraudulent purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most telling, however, is if the employee accesses resources that they wouldn’t ordinarily need for their job. This suggests that they are using information for illegitimate purposes, whether that’s to commit fraud or to share with a third party.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Other signs of insider threat include using unauthorised storage devices (such as USB drives and the Cloud), network crawling and searching for sensitive data and data hoarding.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They might also copy files from sensitive folders, email sensitive data to non-work affiliated accounts or attempt to bypass security mechanisms.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to protect against insider threats</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Insider threats can occur in any number of ways, which means there’s no single solution you can use to mitigate the risk. You must instead take a holistic approach, with an overarching security mechanism to address your vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You should start with technical controls to protect critical assets. This should include network monitoring so you can see when users are active, as well as the documents that they view.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside this, you should implement access controls to ensure that employees can only view information that’s relevant to their job. This will take time to configure, as the requirements for each job role will differ.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, you can cut down on the work by identifying information that’s suitable for everyone in the organisation to view as well as highly classified information that only senior personnel can access.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>From there, access to information can be controlled based on its purpose and who in the organisation uses it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to technical controls, you should adopt cyber security policies that outline employees’ requirements when handling sensitive information.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, you should take steps to promote the organisation’s security culture. This will give staff a greater understanding of insider threats and mitigate the risk of accidental data breaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating a company-wide commitment to information security will also dissuade malicious action, as potential wrongdoers learn about the measures the organisation has in place to detect and identify the source of data breaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The best place to start when developing a security culture is staff awareness training. An effective course will promote the importance of cyber security and demonstrate the technical and organisational measures that are in place to mitigate the risk.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44832\" width=\"199\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8.png 320w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8-300x300.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8-65x65.png 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" /></figure></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can give employees all the information they need with our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/complete-staff-awareness-e-learning-suite\">Complete Staff Awareness E-learning Suite</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This online course offers a quick, affordable and comprehensive solution to your training needs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It contains all eight of our e-learning courses, covering essential topics such as the&nbsp;GDPR,&nbsp;ISO 27001&nbsp;and&nbsp;phishing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All you need to do is purchase a licence for the number of staff taking the courses.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The suite is available on a one-year, easily renewable licence, and the courses can be taken as many times as you like.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-layout-3 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/complete-staff-awareness-e-learning-suite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Learn more</strong></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-an-insider-threat-definition-types-and-examples\">Insider Threats Unveiled: Definition, Types, and Real-Life Examples</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog\">IT Governance UK Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"What Is Data Minimisation?

This is because the answer will depend on the specific circumstances for processing and using the personal data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, organisations must justify their processing practices and explain why they meet the guidelines for data minimisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to solving that issue is to understand what you are trying to achieve with this data processing activity. In other words: what is all this information going to be used for? You should be as specific as possible when answering this question, identifying clear objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use your documented <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lawful basis for processing</a> as a guideline here. For example, if you’re processing the information to meet your legal obligations or contractual requirements, you can identify specific activities within those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, if you’re processing information to protect an individuals’ vital interests, you can ask yourself how each piece of data supports that activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must be careful when completing this process. It might not seem like a crucial task, at least compared to measures specifically designed to prevent data breaches, but data minimisation is a core principle of the GDPR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The damage caused by data breaches is often exacerbated by organisations processing unnecessary amounts of personal information, thus increasing the volume of data compromised in security incidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By keeping your data processing activities to a minimum, you reduce the threat of data breaches and privacy violations. You also reduce the amount of work you need to do to protect and maintain your records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly true when it comes to special category data or criminal offence data, where extra precautions are in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are at all unsure whether your data processing practices meet the thresholds, you should err on the side of caution or seek expert guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also review your processing practices periodically to ensure that the personal data you hold is still relevant and adequate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to look out for</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/#how_do_we_decide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) provides</a> further guidance on the GDPR’s data minimisation requirements, and it provides examples of situations where compliance could be jeopardised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one scenario, the ICO describes a debt collection agency that’s trying to locate a particular debtor. After processing information on several people with a similar name, it finds the right person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the agency must delete the relevant records for the people whose information it collected during its search. However, it’s a good idea to keep a basic record of the people it removed from its search, provided it has no intention of contacting them again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICO highlights that an organisation cannot keep records on the off chance that they will be useful in the future. However, if it can document a reason why that information might be important at a later data, it’s permitted to retain it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another example, the ICO describes a group of individuals who set up a club. At first, it has only a handful of members who all know each other, and the activities are set up using the members’ names and email addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, the club becomes more popular and the administrators realise that they need additional information about its members in order to keep track of their membership status and subscription payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICO notes that, although the group hadn’t initially intended to process these types of data, it’s entitled to change the terms of processing as requirements change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, organisations that fail to change the terms of processing might actually be breaching their data protection obligations. If they don’t have enough data to perform necessary tasks – such as tracking subscriptions – their records are inadequate for the organisation’s purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal data might also be considered inadequate if the organisation makes decisions about someone based on an incomplete understanding of the facts. Incomplete or inaccurate records could lead to information being misinterpreted and false judgements being drawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations should prevent this by reviewing their records regularly to ensure that data is accurate and up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meeting your data minimisation requirements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data minimisation is a crucial practice for all organisations, but as with many aspects of the GDPR, it’s a particular challenge for marketing departments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s why IT Governance created <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GDPR and PECR – A guide for marketers</a> to help explain the difficulties these teams face.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x724.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44805\" width=\"248\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x724.png 1024w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-300x212.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-768x543.png 768w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-211x150.png 211w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7.png 1234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This free green paper explains what you need to do to ensure your marketing activities meet your regulatory requirements, and how you can save time by addressing all privacy legislation together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It covers the key requirements of data protection laws in relation to marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find a range of tips for meeting your GDPR and PECR compliance requirements, including the rules surrounding consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avoid the risk of non-compliance.

In this blog, we explain everything you need to know about it, including our top 8 tips for preventing malware attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>What is malware?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Malware, or malicious software, is a broad term that refers to any type of code that intends to harm a computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can do this in a number of ways, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<li>Stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive information;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hijacking or altering core system functions;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitoring user activity; and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spamming the device with adverts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Types of malware</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different types of malware, but there are <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/7-types-of-malware-you-need-to-look-out-for\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seven types</a> that are extremely common:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<li><strong>Adware</strong> displays ads on your computer – typically in the form of popups and windows that can’t be closed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spyware</strong> monitors Internet activity and gathers information, which can either be sold to a third party or used to target you with adware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bots</strong> run automatic and often repetitive tasks over the Internet. This might not necessarily be for criminal purposes (think, for example, of Twitterbots, which tweet and follow other accounts), but bots can be used to harness multiple computers in a botnet and create a more powerful threat.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ransomware </strong>spreads through a target’s systems, encrypting files as it goes. The criminal behind the attack then demands a payment in exchange for the decryption key.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trojan horses</strong> are malicious programs that masquerades as something useful in an attempt to trick people into downloading it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Viruses</strong> copy themselves and spread, undetected, to other victims. It can do this by attaching itself to programs, script files, documents and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Worms</strong> are self-contained and self-propagating viruses. They usually show up via email and instant messages, and spread over networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-latest-posts__list is-grid

delivered in one of several ways, but the most common method by far is <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/5-ways-to-detect-a-phishing-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">phishing</a>. This is a type of fraud in which bogus messages appear as though they have come from a genuine source and encourage the user to follow a link or download an attachment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, an email might look as though it is from Amazon with an order confirmation for a product the individual hasn’t made. Or perhaps the email contains an invoice attached and is sent to an employee’s work address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever form the message takes, it’s almost always designed to create a sense of urgency and pressure the recipient into acting immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the email contains an attachment, there will be malware hidden within it – often contained in a macro on a Word file – which is unleashed as soon as the user opens the file or approves the macro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, phishing emails that direct users to another website are typically designed to capture  login credentials, but the bogus website might also use another method of malware delivery: drive-by downloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compromised websites can be laced with malware, which infect users&#8217; devices after they inadvertently click a pop-up window that gives the site permission to download an attachment. The windows usually mask as something genuine, such as an error message that looks as though it’s part of the computer’s operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A subset of this is social network spam. Cyber criminals include bogus links on these platforms that direct visitors to a compromised website. For example, a video link might ask you to install a bogus video player plugin, which contains malware.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>How to prevent malware attacks in 2023</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we&#8217;ve explained, malware can attack you in many different ways, so there’s no one way to prevent infections. However, there are certain measures you can take to protect you from an array of threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are eight things you can do to get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<li><strong>Install antivirus and anti-malware software</strong>: These tools help protect your computer from viruses and other types of malicious software. Make sure to choose reputable software and keep it updated.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update software and operating systems</strong>: Keeping software and operating systems updated is important because updates often include security patches and bug fixes that help protect against vulnerabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Disable macro scripts in Microsoft Office files</strong>: Macro scripts can be used to execute malicious code, so it&#8217;s a good idea to disable them in Microsoft Office files unless you know that they are safe.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Back up important data</strong>: Backing up important data is important in case of a data breach or other type of cyber attack. Make sure to keep backups in a secure location.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use a VPN</strong>: Using a VPN can help protect your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide staff awareness training</strong>: Educating employees about cyber security best practices is important to help prevent cyber attacks.

That’s a big risk given how easy it is to back up your files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding these risks should be a cornerstone of our education, because almost everyone these days keeps digital files as part of their job or personal life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/steps-for-securing-business-data-begin-with-first-identifying-it/article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Databodi CTO Carl D’Halluin explains</a>: “Failing to backup your data can have catastrophic consequences, as a single hardware failure, cyberattack, or natural disaster can wipe out all your valuable information, leaving you with no way to recover it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This means that years of hard work can all be lost in an instant, with no chance of retrieval. Even the cost of losing just a portion of your important data can be immeasurable, with potential financial, legal, and reputational implications that can last for years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how important data backups are, you’d be forgiven for thinking that experts had detailed technical advice for securing your information. However, the process can be as simple or as complex as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals might be content to email copies of sensitive files to themselves, keeping them in a server controlled by their email provider. Meanwhile, organisations will probably have more robust measures that automate the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its campaign, World Backup Day urges people to make the following pledge:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1015\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44653\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png 1015w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-300x57.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-768x145.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although that’s a great start, you need to get in the habit of backing up your data on a regular basis. Any time you create a new file or amend an existing one, you must ensure that the data is secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s therefore worth taking the time to figure out a system that suits your needs. The information you save should be stored in a secure location that enables you to find the documents you need easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Online vs offline backups</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common solution for backups is to store your data in the Cloud. Apple iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive are common Cloud storage providers, which enable people to quickly save duplicates in an online server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process is often automatic, and it comes with the added benefit of allowing people to access data on one device that was created in another. This is handy if you have a photo saved on your phone that you want to display on your laptop, or if you want to share a file with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the benefits of the Cloud have seen it take on mythic status among its proponents. There is a mistaken belief that you can simply put whatever information you like into the Cloud and it’ll be safe forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like any other Internet-connected system, the Cloud contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This means that servers can be rendered temporarily unavailable, or the data can viewed by unauthorised parties. Worse still, it could be permanently wiped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no doubt that the Cloud is an ideal way to conveniently secure your files, particularly if you need to regularly access or amend them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have highly classified data or want to be certain that the information won’t be compromised, we recommend storing another set of backups offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might keep your data on a USB stick or a portable hard drive. This ensures that you have versions of the data that are protected from cyber criminals or third-party technical failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a foolproof solution because these devices can also be damaged or lost, but there is a much lower risk of this happening.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/weekly-round-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WEEKLY-ROUNDUP.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-43610\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WEEKLY-ROUNDUP.jpg 800w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WEEKLY-ROUNDUP-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WEEKLY-ROUNDUP-768x398.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-backups-are-for-life-not-just-for-world-backup-day\">Data Backups Are for Life, Not Just for World Backup Day</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog\">IT Governance UK Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"3 reasons cyber security training is essential","link":"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/3-reasons-cyber-security-training-is-essential","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Luke Irwin"},"pubDate":"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 13:09:50 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Cyber Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Training"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/?p=34547"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Organisations are always looking for ways to improve their security practices, and one of the most effective ways to achieve this is by providing employees with&#160;cyber security training.

Here are three reasons to consider it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>1. You’ll reduce the risk of data breaches</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-breaches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">data breaches</a> are caused by a mistake somewhere in the organisation. So if you want to keep your organisation secure, your employees to know what they’re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn’t only mean negligence – it could also be mistakes that you don’t even know are mistakes, such as gaps in your policies, ineffective processes or a lack of proper technological defences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Placing staff on information security training courses will help them understand the mistakes they’re making and teach them to work more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially useful if you intend to commit to a framework such as <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ISO 27001</a>, the international standard for information security, as there are specific courses that teach you how to follow the Standard’s requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>2. You’ll meet compliance requirements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyber security laws and regulations inevitably contain complex requirements, so organisations need employees with specialist knowledge to achieve compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, organisations that are required to appoint a <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DPO (data protection officer)</a> under the <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a> must find someone with an in-depth understanding of data protection law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes associated with the position are huge; if the DPO doesn’t perform their tasks in accordance with the GDPR’s requirements, the organisation is liable to face <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory action</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s therefore paramount that the DPO is given every resource available to do their job properly, and training courses should always be sought where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are not only the quickest way of studying but also usually include exams, which reassures employers that the individual is qualified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same advice applies for individuals in roles that involve compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/pci_dss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</a>, ISO 27001 or any other law or framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>3. You’ll foster career growth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Training courses enable employees to pick up new skills and gain more advanced qualifications, which will help them move into more senior roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t only beneficial for them but also their employers. It’s getting increasingly hard to find qualified information security professionals, with <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-cyber-skills-shortage-rises\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">82% of UK-based organisations saying that there is a cyber security skills shortage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding qualified personnel isn’t the only problem. A small pool of skilled workers also means job candidates can command a higher salary and more benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, organisations might not be able to afford qualified professionals even if they can find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They should therefore do whatever they can to support employees who want to go on training courses. Organisations will almost certainly benefit from the extra knowledge, and it eases the pressure of finding skilled personnel in the job market.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Which course is right for you?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyber security is a broad industry, so you need to decide which area suits you best.

This refers to the completeness and accuracy of data, as well as the organisation’s ability to protect it from corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Data integrity plays an essential and unique role in data protection. We often think of it in relation to who has (or doesn’t have) have access to information. However, it’s just as important to consider whether the information itself is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If there are mistakes within the data, organisations might accidentally share classified information with the wrong person. There is also the possibility that the information won’t be delivered at all.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The third element of the CIA triad is <strong>availability</strong>. This refers to an organisation’s ability to access information when needed. This might be the case, for example, if a power cut knocks out an organisation’s servers or if a Cloud hosting provider’s systems are disrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although data availability often refers to these sorts of organisation-wide issues, it can also apply to individual circumstances. For instance, an employee might have a technical problem that prevents them viewing a sensitive file, or they don’t have keys to a filing cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Examples of the CIA triad</strong><strong></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Confidentiality</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Data confidentiality usually applies to personal information, like customers&#8217; names, contact details, and payment card information. These details should be stored in relevant databases and made accessible only to those who need it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This might mean password-protecting files or setting up access controls. You should also consider storing different pieces of information in the separate databases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You wouldn’t, for instance, keep the customer account details, such as their username and password, in the same files as their other personal data. You should also silo highly sensitive data, such as credit card information and health records.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Confidentiality doesn’t only refer to personal data, though. It encompasses any information of a sensitive nature. This might include things such as intellectual property and corporate records. These too must be given adequate protection to ensure that only authorised personnel can gain access.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Integrity</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An example of data integrity would occur in relation to a healthcare firm mailing a patient information about their medical condition.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The organisation must be certain that their records are correct, otherwise the recipient will receive incorrect information about their health status, or they might not receive an update at all. Meanwhile, the person who inadvertently received the communication will be privy to a third party’s health condition.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Data integrity can also refer to corporate data. For example, an organisation must ensure that the price of products on their e-commerce site are listed correctly. If they inadvertently undercharge someone for an item, they are obliged to fulfil their order, which will have financial ramifications for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Availability</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An organisation’s systems, applications and data must be accessible to authorised users on demand. If, for example, the organisation suffers a power outage that knocks their systems offline, their operations will grind to a halt.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, if cyber criminals encrypt the organisation’s files in a ransomware attack, they will face major disruption.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Availability can also apply to a specific employee’s ability to view information. If there is a problem with their account or hardware, they might not be able to access information necessary to perform their job.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Why is the CIA triad important?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Each aspect of the CIA triad represents the foundational principles of information security. Between them, they cover every possible way that sensitive data can be compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But the triad is about more than the individual aspects of data protection; the three components work together to become more than the sum of their parts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44472\" width=\"267\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png 719w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2-300x252.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2-70x60.png 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/01/16/drive-compliance-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IBM</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There is a reason that confidentiality, integrity and availability are thought of in a triangular pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Each element connects with the others, and when you implement measures to ensure the protection of one, you must consider the ramifications it has elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, say an organisation implements multifactor authentication on a piece of third-party software.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Doing so protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, making it harder for unauthorised actors to compromise an employee’s login credentials and view information on their account.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But doing so hampers the availability of data, because employees now need to complete an authentication process to access the software.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Without the means to complete the authentication process – whether it’s a hardware token, an app on one’s phone or a functional biometric scanner – employees cannot continue.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the three principles together within the framework of a triad helps organisations understand their needs and requirements when developing information security controls.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>Implementing the CIA triad</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CIA triad runs through the heart of information security best practice.

When you come to this realisation, you can implement an incident response plan that helps you identify and investigate security threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ensures that you can respond promptly when disaster strikes, mitigating the damage, and saving your organisation time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how exactly should you investigate a cyber incident? We explain everything you need to know in this blog, outlining five steps to guide you from disaster to recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>1. Identification</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed is of the essence when it comes to incident response. The faster you can identify a breach, the sooner you can kick a malicious actor off your systems and begin the recovery process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways that an incident might be identified. You might, for example, have automated threat detection tools that issue an alert when it spots malicious activity. Alternatively, someone on your team might spot something suspicious and alert the IT team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>2. Initial investigation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve identified a potential data breach, you should conduct a preliminary investigation. The goal is to identify all systems and services that have been affected, which will help you understand the scope of the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also document what sensitive information, if any, has been compromised. It’s best to err on the side of caution here; you might not know definitively what data a malicious actor accessed, but you will know what they could have viewed given the nature of their intrusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a single corporate account was compromised, the attacker would have access to anything that employee viewed. By contrast, if they launched a ransomware attack, they could conceivably have exfiltrated every piece of sensitive information on the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>3. Immediate action</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know exactly what’s happened, you must take urgent steps to isolate the affected areas of your business. You can think of this part of the investigation like police cordoning off the scene of the crime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to prevent any contamination of the evidence and to gather any relevant information about what has happened. You should interview the people who discovered the breach to find out what they know, and gather any evidence that’s immediately available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where relevant, you must also notify law enforcement and regulators about the data breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>4. Analyse the data</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve gathered the relevant information about the cyber incident, you must analyse it. The goal is to gain a more complete understanding of how the data breach occurred and what information or systems were compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should discover, for example, whether it was caused be an internal actor or a criminal hacker. You might also discover whether a malicious actor had privileged access to data and for how long the information was compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>5. Remediation planning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a clear understanding of what happened and – more importantly – how, you can draw conclusions about the incident and look for ways to resolve the data breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specific actions you take here will depend on the nature of the incident. You must therefore have a comprehensive plan that outlines remediation efforts related to all relevant information security risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documented plan should include estimates for how long remediation tasks will take, the level of priority each one is given and the person responsible for overseeing the task.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-transform: none;\"><strong>What next?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the investigation complete, it’s time to contain the threat and get back to business as usual. As part of this process, security specialists should carefully monitor the network and recovered systems to ensure that the threat has been fully addressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand at IT Governance that you might not have the internal expertise to manage this process with confidence.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44437\" width=\"196\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image.png 320w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-300x300.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-65x65.png 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s why we created our <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/cyber-incident-response-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cyber Incident Response Investigation</a> service to provide support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team of experts will help you manage the investigation process from beginning to end, answering key questions such as how the threat actor gained access and the steps needed to contain, eradicate and recover from the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This CREST-accredited service is highly scalable, and can be used for anything as small as a data breach involving a single compromised USB stick or as large as an organisation-wide outage.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-layout-7 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-element-button\" href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/cyber-incident-response-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Learn more</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-investigate-a-cyber-incident-5-step-guide\">How to Investigate a Cyber Incident: 5-Step Guide</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog\">IT Governance UK Blog</a>.</p>\n"}}]}}}
