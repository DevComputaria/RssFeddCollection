When the execute method is called, it returns the string &#8220;success&#8221; once the action was executed successfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, we&#8217;ll examine the extended class <em>ConfluenceActionSupport</em> located at <em>com.atlassian.confluence.core</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div class=\"q-code\">package com.atlassian.confluence.core;\n\n[..SNIP..]\n\npublic class ConfluenceActionSupport extends ActionSupport implements LocaleProvider, WebInterface, MessageHolderAware {\n\n[..SNIP..]\n\n  public BootstrapStatusProvider getBootstrapStatusProvider() {\n\n    if (this.bootstrapStatusProvider == null)\n\n      this.bootstrapStatusProvider = BootstrapStatusProviderImpl.getInstance();\n\n    return this.bootstrapStatusProvider;\n\n  }\n\n[..SNIP..]\n</div></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the Java class <em>ConfluenceActionSupport</em>, we see a public method named <em>getBootstrapStatusProvider</em> returning an object <em>bootstrapStatusProvider</em>. If the <em>bootstrapStatusProvider </em>is null, it initializes by calling <em>BootstrapStatusProviderImpl.getInstance()</em>, where the <em>getInstance() </em>method appears to get an instance of the<em> </em>bootstrap status provider. Once the object <em>bootstrapStatusProvider</em> is created or already exists, the method returns it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following that, <em>BootstrapStatusProviderImpl</em> class at <em>com.atlassian.confluence.impl.setup</em>, comprises a public method named <em>getApplicationConfig</em> which returns the ApplicationConfiguration object.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div class=\"q-code\">package com.atlassian.confluence.impl.setup;\n\n[..SNIP..]\n\npublic class BootstrapStatusProviderImpl implements BootstrapStatusProvider, BootstrapManagerInternal {\n\n  private static final Supplier instance = (Supplier)Suppliers.memoize(BootstrapStatusProviderImpl::initialiseBootstrapStatusProvider);\n\n[..SNIP..]\n\n  public ApplicationConfiguration getApplicationConfig() {\n\n    return this.delegate.getApplicationConfig();\n\n  }\n\n[..SNIP..]\n\n}\n</div></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the <em>getApplicationConfig</em> method, the method call to <em>this.delegate.getApplicationConfig();</em> is using delegation where <em>getApplicationConfig()</em> is delegating the task of fetching application configuration on another object referred to as delegate. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>ApplicationConfiguration</em> is an interface specifying multiple methods that any class can implement.

The purpose of this parameter is to define or update the setup completion status of the Confluence application. The setup process is complete when we pass true as the <em>setupComplete </em>parameter. When we pass <strong>false</strong>, it indicates that the setup process is incomplete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unifying components from classes such as <em>ConfluenceActionSupport</em>, <em>BootstrapStatusProviderImpl</em>, and <em>ApplicationConfig</em>, we can chain method calls, including <em>getBootstrapStatusProvider()</em>, <em>getApplicationConfig()</em>, and <em>setSetupComplete()</em>, which we&#8217;ve explored thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>getBootstrapStatusProvider():</strong></em> This method is called to obtain an instance of the BootstrapStatusProvider.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>getApplicationConfig():</em></strong> This is called on the result of <em>getBootstrapStatusProvider()</em>.

This object manages application configuration settings, including the setupComplete status.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>setSetupComplete(</strong></em><strong><em>)</em>:</strong> Finally, <em>setSetupComplete()</em> is called on the ApplicationConfig object. This method sets the setupComplete status to either true or false, indicating the setup process for the application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By chaining method calls, we efficiently set the <em>setupComplete</em> value to false using getBootstrapStatusProvider().getApplicationConfig().setSetupComplete(false);</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confluence uses the XWork2 framework, which manages actions, interceptors, and parameter binding, among other things. In XWork2, HTTP parameters are used to set properties in action classes, and the framework automatically maps these parameters to setter methods based on naming conventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to this, we can form an HTTP parameter that enables a series of method invocations.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted has-black-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color:#abb7c21f\">bootstrapStatusProvider.applicationConfig.setupComplete=false</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the payload against the server-info.action endpoint would adjust the <em>setupComplete </em>value to <strong>false</strong>, signifying that the setup process remains incomplete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"AtlassianConfluenceBrokenAccessControlVulnerability(CVE202322515)-Stage2:Accessingsetupadministratorendpoint\">Stage 2: &nbsp;Accessing setupadministrator endpoint</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the <em>setupComplete </em>attribute has been updated, the expected behavior would allow us to access the setup/setup administrator.action endpoint and create an Administrator account. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when we send a POST request to this endpoint, we receive a 403 Forbidden response status code and a response body containing the following message: <em>&#8216;Your request could not be processed because a required security token was not present in the request.

Its release marks a seismic shift for the future of Qualys through a platform approach that allows the Qualys TruRisk engine to ingest external third-party Risk Factors from IT and security tools and then employ them with risk-eliminating actions using Qualys Vulnerability Detection and Management (<a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/\">VMDR</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the release of the Enterprise TruRisk Platform, Qualys is the only cybersecurity platform vendor that offers customers transparent cyber risk scoring capabilities that complement a full suite of asset management, attack surface management, vulnerability management, remediation, policy compliance, and advanced threat protection—all offered in a single, unified interface. According to a recent survey from <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/ciso-report.html\">Splunk</a>, nearly 50% of CISOs now report directly to the CEO, and nearly 100% regularly brief their Board of Directors, increasing the pressure to report Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), as well as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to these direction-setting stakeholders. In short, this means that cybersecurity experts must also become business risk experts and be able to link cyber risk actions directly to business impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\" https://player.vimeo.com/video/883016796?autoplay=true&#038;loop=true\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to facilitating faster, more accurate threat remediation, the Enterprise TruRisk Platform is built to meet these evolving risk management needs.

It sheds light on the critical concept that risks in the cloud are not merely additive; they are multiplicative. A vulnerability, when paired with a misconfiguration and compounded by internet exposure, escalates into a significantly higher threat. This toxic combination demands immediate and prioritized remediation. It&#8217;s not just about identifying a long list of issues to address; it&#8217;s about understanding the compound effect and pinpointing where a single fix can mitigate multiple risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By unifying these varied data streams, each with its own set of priorities, TruRisk Insight offers a singular, prioritized view of your cloud risk landscape. It’s not just a collection of alerts and alarms—it&#8217;s a strategic overview that allows you to see how all the different pieces of the puzzle fit together. It&#8217;s about transforming complex, multifaceted data into a clear narrative that guides your security decisions. With TruRisk Insight, you&#8217;re not just reacting; you&#8217;re anticipating and strategizing. It&#8217;s a powerful tool that doesn&#8217;t just inform you of what&#8217;s happening now but also prepares you for what could happen next, ensuring that your responses are as informed as they are swift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/totalcloud/\">Learn more about TotalCloud</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"trurisk-artificial-intelligence-ai\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">TruRisk Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dilip Bachwani, Qualys CTO, shared the Qualys approach to AI with TruRisk AI and summarized the purpose-built, petabyte-scale security data lake, trillions of high-fidelity security data events, and signals across asset inventories, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, cloud and OT/IOT that make TruRisk AI possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full q-image-no-shadow\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"936\" height=\"482\" data-attachment-id=\"34396\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/qsc23-qualys-announces-a-directional-shift-to-measure-communicate-and-eliminate-cyber-risk-with-new-platform-and-solutions/attachment/picture1-4-3\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4.png\" data-orig-size=\"936,482\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Picture1-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4-300x154.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34396\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4.png 936w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4-300x154.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Picture1-4-768x395.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualys TruRisk AI will learn from customer behavior, Qualys apps, third-party apps, and more to help customers apply practical aspects of artificial intelligence to help customers better identify assets and users, discover critical assets, and propose remediation actions that may be overlooked<strong>.

Through this new functionality, you can now accurately measure risk by automatically adding these new vectors to an asset’s TruRisk score. Previously, it was difficult to quantify risk throughout the sprawl of tech debt, unauthorized software, and missing security agents. Now, security teams can easily understand the risk that each of these factors poses to the business to prioritize mitigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to tighter integration with TruRisk, Qualys also previewed an upcoming CSAM capability that helps our customers “Know the TruRisk of your SBOMs.” Soon, CSAM will track all software bills of materials (SBOMs) in a single place to analyze and measure the TruRisk of software component vulnerabilities in your production environment. This allows security teams to quickly identify applications running any vulnerable component, prioritize using TruRisk, and triage/remediate in a fraction of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">Learn more about CSAM</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keynote-speakers\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keynote Speakers</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rachel Wilson – Managing Director at Morgan Stanley</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>“It is now imperative for all of us to take a risk-based approach to cybersecurity.”</em></p>\n<cite><em>Rachel Wilson</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"713\" data-attachment-id=\"34397\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/qsc23-qualys-announces-a-directional-shift-to-measure-communicate-and-eliminate-cyber-risk-with-new-platform-and-solutions/attachment/dsc00227\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-scaled.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;ILCE-7M4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1699413695&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;3200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DSC00227\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-300x200.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-1070x713.jpg\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-1070x713.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34397\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-1070x713.jpg 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00227-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Rachel Wilson – Managing Director at Morgan Stanley.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilson laid out how global threat actors are evolving in their motivations and how they affect their geo-political, financial, and tactical outcomes. Now, at increasing levels, government-sanctioned efforts with data and tools purchased from the Dark Web are targeting financial institutions and their customers. She emphasized that it is untenable to defend every inch of the technology environment in a reactive manner. Organizations, from the board to the C-suite to the boots on the ground deploying patches, must be aligned on how to prioritize vulnerabilities that expose the business to the most potential risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That challenge of communicating and prioritizing risk falls on CISOs and cybersecurity leaders, according to Wilson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In these unfortunate cases of major security breaches, how often does it fall at the feet of the CIO or the IT leader?” asked Rachel, highlighting that when it comes to cyber breaches, it ultimately falls on the CISO and cybersecurity leaders.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilson explained that IT may be responsible for deploying the patch or the mitigation. Still, the CISO must lead the risk-based approach to cut through the noise and identify the critical priorities. As the attack surface continues to evolve, and as geo-political conflicts increasingly lead to cyber-attacks, the stakes are higher than ever for security teams to identify and prioritize critical business risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frank Dickson – Group Vice President, Security &amp; Trust at IDC research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to IDC reporting, 40% of revenue from Global 2000 companies will come from digital products by 2026. That’s why Dickson says the “digital transformation era” is over, and the “digital-first era” has begun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Digital decision velocity creates complexity,” Dickson explained. “And complexity is the enemy of security.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To simplify their approach, cybersecurity professionals need to narrow their focus on goals and outcomes, according to Frank. He encouraged the audience to force their vendors to explain the benefits, not the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you can save 30% on your most precious resource—your peoples’ time, that helps you become more secure because now they can solve multiple problems,” Dickson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital complexity is introducing cyber risk, which is a problem all businesses will continue to face as more and more of their revenue depends on technology. For cybersecurity teams, that means consolidating tools, focusing on goals and metrics that drive security, and measuring ROI in business terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full

Whether the focus is narrow in scope (such as web apps on embedded devices) or broad (such as cyber risk reporting at an executive level), QSC attendees have seen firsthand how a risk-based approach to <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">asset</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/#easm\">attack surface</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/\">vulnerability management</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/patch-management/\">threat remediation</a>, and more can be leveraged as a business enabler with measurable results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few stories from the last two days:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cintas-consolidating-the-approach-with-risk-based-vulnerability-management\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cintas: Consolidating the approach with Risk-Based Vulnerability Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For Cintas Security Operations Manager Tom Scheffler, visualizing and securing a distributed network spanning 13 distribution centers and over 47,000 employees is no small task. As a $10 billion company full of acquired businesses and over 11,000 distribution routes, accurate asset management, risk-based vulnerability management, and tooling consolidation was a central reason for Cintas in choosing Qualys as their partner. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“By eliminating point solutions, we can unify asset intelligence from everywhere in Cintas and measure cyber risk by asset group. This allows us to communicate risk effectively within our organization, and it helps our teams prioritize their work,” Scheffler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Qualys, security teams were inundated with risk alerts and daily patching tasks coming from disjointed security and IT asset management tools. Prioritizing vulnerabilities was an arduous task, compounded by an extensive network of external, internet-facing assets. As a result, Cintas did not have a reliable means of measuring or reducing cyber risk, and cyber risk insurance premiums skyrocketed as a result.  </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-34382\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full q-image-no-shadow\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4807\" height=\"2103\" data-attachment-id=\"34383\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/de-risking-in-practice-how-qualys-customers-are-driving-value-in-their-organizations/attachment/trurisk-risk-based-image\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image.png\" data-orig-size=\"4807,2103\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TruRisk-Risk-based-image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-300x131.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-1070x468.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34383\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image.png 4807w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-300x131.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-1070x468.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-768x336.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-1536x672.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TruRisk-Risk-based-image-2048x896.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4807px) 100vw, 4807px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>VMDR with TruRisk aggregation and interpretation of disparate risk signals in one unified dashboard.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By adding <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">CSAM</a> to <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/\">VMDR</a>, Cintas now has 100% coverage of its external attack surface (including mergers, acquisitions, and subsidiaries). In fact, Cintas has seen a 300% increase in the visibility of internet-facing assets. With <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/patch-management/\">Patch Management</a> built natively into the platform, Scheffler said that Cintas has reduced MTTR from 2 months to 8 days for critical vulnerabilities and a double-digit reduction in cyber insurance costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We like the term ‘risk-based approach’ because it allows us to show stakeholders where the greatest risks to Cintas are, and then we can align our resources to eliminate that risk,” according to Scheffler.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Positive Business Impact of Qualys for Cintas:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">300% increase in the visibility of internet-facing assets.</mark></li>\n\n\n\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Reduced MTTR from 2 months to 8 days for critical vulnerabilities</mark></li>\n\n\n\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Double-digit reduction in cyber insurance costs</mark></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"associated-british-foods-improving-visibility-and-standardizing-communication-of-cyber-risk\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Associated British Foods: Improving visibility and standardizing communication of cyber risk</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s clear that a major theme from QSC Orlando is measuring, communicating, and eliminating cyber risk efficiently, that can be easier said than done when 132,000 employees are operating across 53 countries. This is the case for Associated British Foods, which previously managed cyber risk and compliance from over 300 homegrown dashboards, with disjointed data leading to inefficient work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Copeland (Head of Governance, Risk and Compliance &amp; Sr IT Security Manager) and his team made it a mission to unify vulnerability management along with cyber risk and compliance reporting using <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/\">Qualys VMDR with TruRisk</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We needed a platform that could scale across geolocations to translate risk insights in a common dashboard. VMDR with TruRisk not only provides flexibility across business units with a tagging system, but also provides consistent cyber risk measurement so we can scale remediation and compliance efforts,” said Copeland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few years, Associated British Foods has gone from disjointed and ad hoc security/compliance efforts to achieve:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Consistent and actionable cyber risk metrics with TruRisk across BUs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Asset tagging across the org to reflect risk and remediation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved user permission hygiene with processes to disable and delete inactive accounts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>External site scanning to add/remove sites and maintain compliance with Web Application Scanning</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Consolidated cyber risk over 300 dashboards into three primary templates for Management, SecOps, and IT Ops</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4400\" height=\"1489\" data-attachment-id=\"34385\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/de-risking-in-practice-how-qualys-customers-are-driving-value-in-their-organizations/attachment/abf\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF.png\" data-orig-size=\"4400,1489\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ABF\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-300x102.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-1070x362.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34385\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF.png 4400w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-300x102.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-1070x362.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-768x260.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-1536x520.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABF-2048x693.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4400px) 100vw, 4400px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Three-step process for reduced cyber risk and cyber risk posture improvement for Associated British Foods</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Associated British Foods can measure risk with <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/\">VMDR and TruRisk</a>, communicate risk with streamlined reporting and dashboards, and eliminate risk with defined workflows within a single platform.

Yesterday, Director of Product Security Jeremy Block provided an overview of a more specific challenge: securing embedded devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertiv manufactures many devices that run a web server and application for UI and system integration. Embedded devices running web applications are susceptible to many of the same attacks as typical web apps but are often more limited when it comes to remediation efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block identified Qualys <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/web-app-scanning/\">Web Application Scanning</a> (WAS) as a vehicle for runtime testing against embedded devices and as a path to prioritize risks and misconfigurations based on OWASP Top 10, CWSS, and CVSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It has increased the efficiency of our engineering teams and allowed them to eliminate risks that our customers used to find in their own AppSec programs,” Block said. “It has increased our customers’ trust in Vertiv and decreased the total cost of security issues on our end.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Positive Business Impact of Qualys for Vertiv:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">100% Asset Visibility</mark></li>\n\n\n\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">4-hour mean-time-to-respond (MTTR) to known vulnerabilities</mark></li>\n\n\n\n<li><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linking security risk posture to financial impact</mark></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"idb-bank-driving-business-value-with-attack-surface-management\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">IDB Bank: Driving business value with attack surface management.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When VP of Application Security Beatrice Sirchis looked at the constantly evolving technology landscape for IDB Bank, she saw an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Like most businesses, our environment was becoming so complex, we really needed to look at cyber security as a business enabler,” Sirchis explained. “We need to defend against cyber risk and meet stringent security standards for banking, but it can’t slow down the business. I needed an edge to continuously maintain visibility of cyber risk as the environment changes.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That opportunity led her to the Enterprise TruRisk<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Platform, and specifically to <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">Qualys CSAM</a>. With CSAM, Beatrice knew she could leverage additional discovery methods to uncover blind spots in her inventory, track, and plan mitigation of EoL/EoS software, and add security agents such as CrowdStrike and Splunk wherever they were missing. She could also build dashboards for Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) to provide transparency to internal auditors and compliance officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We use quite a few applications with outdated versions of Java and .NET,” Sirchis explained. “We need to know exactly where those applications are, the potential risks to the business, and when they must be updated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For IDB Bank, the cherry on top is the <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cmdb-sync/\">CMDB integration with ServiceNow</a>. By tagging <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">CSAM assets</a> and syncing with ServiceNow, Sirchis and her team have automated ticket assignments for almost every remediation instance. The end result is a 95% reduction in MTTR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/\">Qualys CSAM</a> allows my team to be an enabling factor in IDB Bank’s technology advantages.

This allows us to communicate risk effectively within our organization, and it helps our teams prioritize their work,” Scheffler said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Qualys, security teams were inundated with risk alerts and daily patching tasks coming from disjointed security and IT asset management tools. Prioritizing vulnerabilities was an arduous task, compounded by an extensive network of external, internet-facing assets. As a result, Cintas did not have a reliable means of measuring or reducing cyber risk, and cyber risk insurance premiums skyrocketed as a result.  </p>\n\n\n\n"}},{"title":"Leveraging AI-informed Cybersecurity to Measure, Communicate, and Eliminate Cyber Risk","link":"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/leveraging-ai-informed-cybersecurity-to-measure-communicate-and-eliminate-cyber-risk","comments":"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/09/leveraging-ai-informed-cybersecurity-to-measure-communicate-and-eliminate-cyber-risk#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Thomas Nuth"},"pubDate":"Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:31:59 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"QSC"},{"#cdata-section":"ai"},{"#cdata-section":"AI security"},{"#cdata-section":"artificial intelligence"},{"#cdata-section":"attack surface management"},{"#cdata-section":"CNAPP"},{"#cdata-section":"TruRisk AI"},{"#cdata-section":"vulnerability management"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://blog.qualys.com/?p=34372"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"The threat landscape is constantly evolving, and so are the implications of cyber risk across any organization.

During our <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/qsc/2023/orlando/\">2023 Qualys Security Conference (QSC)</a> taking place in Orlando, Florida, November 6-9, 2023, attendees learned how Qualys <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/totalcloud/\">TotalCloud</a> provides an effective platform for implementing and managing Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) in a modern enterprise. But let&#8217;s first explore some of the challenges that contribute to these patterns in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-34368\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"challenge-1-measurement\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge 1: Measurement</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A siloed</strong> view of risk across hybrid environments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The siloed view of risk across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments presents two significant challenges: visibility and prioritization. When assets are spread across multiple cloud services and tools and teams do not communicate, achieving a 360-degree view of risk is difficult. Additionally, with so many different risks, it is difficult to prioritize effectively without a holistic view of the landscape. These challenges are compounded in multi-cloud environments, where organizations must manage different technologies and philosophies of risk. This can lead to a false sense of security, as organizations may be unaware of the risks outside their siloed view.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"challenge-2-communication\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge 2: Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Infective communication of risk across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the difficulty of presenting a comprehensive risk report to the board and management, distilling complex data from hybrid systems to guide strategic decisions. Developers, operations staff, and DevOps groups often face the challenge of receiving disjointed communications that obscure urgent issues. Additionally, the need for clear and unified compliance reporting to auditors adds complexity, potentially stretching your team&#8217;s resources thin. These communication barriers are more than just obstacles; they can weaken your overall risk management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"challenge-3-elimination\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge 3: Elimination</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lengthy remediation processes that take months</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the fast-paced domain of cloud security, the duration of the remediation process is critical. Delays in addressing misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or threats can provide windows of opportunity for attacks. Accelerating the identification and rectification of issues is vital, as is the need to expedite the risk-elimination process. Automation, one-click, and the ability to integrate ITSM tools to assign tickets automatically emerge as crucial elements that can transform risk mitigation from a reactive process to an efficient and proactive operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These challenges underline the need for a robust cloud security mechanism, and Qualys TotalCloud is the AI CNAPP solution that bridges these gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"introducing-qualys-totalcloud\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Qualys TotalCloud</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"523\" data-attachment-id=\"34404\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/qualys-security-conference/2023/11/08/effectively-measure-communicate-and-eliminate-cloud-risks-with-totalcloud/attachment/screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9-03-21-am\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM.png\" data-orig-size=\"2312,1130\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-300x147.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-1070x523.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-1070x523.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34404\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-1070x523.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-300x147.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-768x375.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-1536x751.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-9.03.21-AM-2048x1001.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">TotalCloud is a comprehensive CNAPP solution built for multi-cloud environments across all workloads.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TotalCloud is a comprehensive Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) solution that provides unified vulnerability, threat, and posture management from development to runtime and measures, communicates, and eliminates risks across multi-cloud environments, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Flexible, continuous, and quick scanning capabilities</strong>: <a href=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2022/11/01/why-is-snapshot-scanning-not-enough\">Qualys FlexScan</a> provides continuous scanning for vulnerabilities using agentless techniques and agents. It supports multiple scanning methods, including API-, Snapshot-, Agent-, and Network-based scanning to provide continuous, quick, and comprehensive visibility into vulnerabilities across a multi-cloud environment. This flexible approach allows security teams to identify potential vulnerabilities within minutes in a continuous manner. FlexScan can scan workloads using the fastest available scanning method (results available in under 10 minutes), such as API-based scanning, and then leverages a more comprehensive scanning method, such as agent-based scanning, for a more in-depth assessment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>TruRisk Insights provides one prioritized view of risk</strong>: TruRisk Insights sheds light on the critical concept that risks in the cloud are not merely additive — they are multiplicative. A vulnerability, when paired with a misconfiguration and compounded by internet exposure, escalates into a significantly higher threat. This toxic combination demands immediate and prioritized remediation. TruRisk Insights consolidates critical indicators from diverse Qualys sources, such as Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and Cloud Detection and Response, into a cohesive, actionable dashboard. Additionally, it integrates data from your External Attack Surface Management (EASM) solutions, giving you visibility into how external threats may perceive and target your cloud assets. By unifying these varied data streams, each with its own set of priorities, TruRisk Insights offers a singular, prioritized view of your cloud risk landscape.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Managing the security posture and risk across your entire SaaS application stack</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/saas-security-posture-management/\">Qualys SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)</a> brings the same level of security awareness and control that you already have in your cloud infrastructure to the SaaS applications that are critical to your business processes. It helps you protect your SaaS applications from cyberattacks and ensure compliance with industry regulations. Qualys SSPM automatically inventories all your SaaS application users and user groups (internal and external) and the files and folders they own and have access to. It also gathers detailed information on endpoints, such as asset details, location, running services, installed software, etc. This information helps manage users and data access rights effectively, identify and remediate misconfigurations in your SaaS applications and monitor user activity and data access to detect suspicious behavior and one-click remediation. Additionally, TruRisk Insights can now provide you with a prioritized view of security findings for your SaaS applications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deep learning AI to detect known and unknown threats in real time:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/cloud-detection-response/\">Qualys Cloud Detection and Response (CDR)</a> uses deep learning AI to detect malware in real-time across the entire cloud kill chain, including reconnaissance, exploitation, installation, command and control, actions on objectives, and lateral movement. This helps organizations manage and reduce cloud security risk by scanning cloud infrastructure at runtime and in a cloud-native manner, including container images. With CDR&#8217;s AI-based approach, security teams can now detect both known and unknown malware from development to runtime, preventing stealthy attacks and reducing the risk of a cloud breach. CDR&#8217;s ability to continuously self-learn from new data means that it becomes more efficient at identifying false positives over time, thereby reducing the burden on security teams and allowing them to focus on genuine threats.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automated, one-click, and custom remediations and ITSM tool integration:</strong> Qualys offers a variety of remediation options, including automated, one-click, and custom remediation. Qualys also provides complete evidence and clear steps to drive remediation.\n<ul>\n<li>Automated Remediation: Qualys offers no-code, drag-and-drop workflows to simplify time-consuming operational tasks, such as assessing vulnerabilities on ephemeral cloud assets, alerting high-priority threats, remediating misconfigurations, and quarantining high-risk assets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One-Click Remediation: Qualys offers out-of-the-box, one-click remediation for over 50 highly exploited misconfigurations. This allows you to remediate and control misconfiguration on a single resource or multiple resources with a single click, improving your compliance score.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom Remediation: You can also customize remediation by creating your own workflows based on your business requirements, or you can use Qualys-provided workflows that you can customize.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrations with ITSM Tools: Qualys offers integrations with ITSM tools to automatically assign tickets and enable orchestration of remediation to reduce MTTR.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexible licensing provides lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and higher return on investment (ROI):</strong> Qualys delivers a modular and flexible licensing model that gives customers the flexibility to deploy what they want and when they want and the ability to move licenses when they want and how they want. This results in lower TCO and higher ROI because customers start with what they need without unused licenses going to waste. It also allows moving licenses without opening new POs or getting finance approval. This is not just about convenience; it&#8217;s about the intelligent allocation of resources. The absence of a need to re-license for different features means that customers can pivot their focus as their security demands change without additional financial overhead.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, TotalCloud offers a robust solution for accurately measuring, communicating, and mitigating risks within multi-cloud environments.

Today, nearly 50% of CISOs report directly to the CEO, with over 90% regularly briefing their Board of Directors about their organization’s exposure to cyber risk. As a result, CISOs are being nudged into roles that require them to move beyond merely enumerating cyber risk in the form of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, CISOs and security leaders must also measure and communicate cyber risk in the form of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide the business impact of vulnerabilities, threats, and risk posture in real time. However, this is easier said than done. With over 60 security tools on average, security leaders are forced to parse through a complex maze of risk data from a collection of disparate solutions managed by different teams and split between IT and Security to calculate, articulate, and remediate cyber risk across their extended infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case in point – over the last year, the Qualys Threat Research Unit ran over 2.6 billion vulnerability scans across 60 million assets to find that 2.1 billion of those scans were scored as ‘critical’ or ‘high’ according to CVSS. Meanwhile, of these ‘critical’ or ‘high’ CVSS results, only 603 million, or less than a third, were truly high risk when applying the contextual analysis of the Qualys TruRisk engine. Conversely, from this same sample, Qualys researchers also found that CVSS rated 87 million vulnerabilities as ‘low’ or ‘medium’ risk. In contrast, TruRisk rated them as ‘high’ or ‘critical’ &#8211; highlighting the inaccuracy and danger of relying on CVSS alone to measure and prioritize cyber risk. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I pointed out in my QSC address, cybersecurity leaders, and any cyber risk stakeholder for that matter, are guiding their cyber risk mitigation and remediation strategies with incomplete, inaccurate risk information. Instead, they’re measuring risk with limited data, and because of this, they’re communicating the cyber risk inaccurately to their stakeholders and not reducing cyber risk effectively for their businesses. It’s a big problem that most cybersecurity companies are not solving in the way they need to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image q-image-no-shadow\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"510\" data-attachment-id=\"34362\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/08/cybersecurity-at-a-crossroads-new-implications-on-business-risk/attachment/ciso-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-scaled.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1219\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"CISO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-300x143.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-1070x510.jpg\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-1070x510.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34362\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-1070x510.jpg 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-300x143.jpg 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-768x366.jpg 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-1536x732.jpg 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CISO-2048x975.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The many responsibilities of today’s cybersecurity leader require the measurement, communication, and elimination of cyber risk.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Enterprise TruRisk Platform not only provides a centralized way for organizations to measure and eliminate their cyber risk but also arms users with the actionable insights they need to communicate their actual cyber risk posture to internal security and business risk stakeholders.

CVSS score is not just a base case.  To stress the importance of this, the following new nomenclature was adopted by CVSS v4:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>CVSS Nomenclature</strong></th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>CVSS Metrics Used</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-B&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BE</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base and Environmental metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BT&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base and Threat metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BTE</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base, Threat, Environmental metrics</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Supplemental Metric Group &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 introduces a new optional metric group called the “Supplemental Metric Group.” It provides metrics that describe and measure additional extrinsic attributes of a vulnerability. The Supplemental Metric Group aims to provide contextual information that consumers can use to take additional actions that help them in further risk analysis. It is important to note that Supplemental metrics are optional, and they do not have any impact on the calculated CVSS scores. Supplemental metrics to help you better understand extrinsic questions about vulnerabilities include: &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Safety&nbsp;</td><td>Does exploiting this vulnerability have a safety impact on an organization?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Automatable&nbsp;</td><td>Are attackers able to automate exploitation of this vulnerability?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Recovery&nbsp;</td><td>After an attack are the systems/component able to self-recover?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Provide Urgency&nbsp;</td><td>What is the rating provided by the vendor for this vulnerability?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Value Density&nbsp;</td><td>What resources will the attacker gain control over with a single exploitation event?&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Base Metric: Attack Requirement (AT): &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Attack Requirement (AT) metric aims to provide more granularity than provided by the “Attack Complexity (AC)” metric. This new metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attack Complexity – Reflect the exploit engineering complexity required to evade or circumvent defensive or security-enhancing technologies. (Defensive measures) &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attack Requirements – Reflect the prerequisite conditions of the vulnerable component that make the attack possible. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-was-updated-removed-in-cvss-v4-0\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\">What was updated/removed in CVSS v4.0? &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rename and Simplified Threat Metrics: &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 renamed the “Temporal” Metric from CVSS v3.1 to “Threat Metrics.” CVSS v4.0 also retired the “Remediation Level (RL)” and “Report Confidence (RC)” metrics. In addition, the “Exploit Code Maturity (E)” was renamed to “Exploit Maturity (E).” The “High (H)” and “Functional (F)” values for this metric in CVSS v3.1 were also merged into one value of “Attacked (A)” in CVSS v4.0. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Base Metric:  User Interaction (UI): &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component. CVSS v4.0 proposes the User Interaction (UI) metric to be more granular. CVSS v3.1 the User Interaction (UI) metric had values None(N) or Required(R). With CVSS v4.0 this metric now provides more granularity to the amount of interaction required as Passive (P) or Active (A). See more details at:  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document</a>  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Retired Base Metric: Scope (S):  &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the CVSS v3.1 Base Metric of Scope(S) was retired in CVSS v4.0 due to the lack of clarity on the usage of this metric. This led to inconsistent scoring among vulnerabilities by different product providers. Due to this reason, the Scope Metric was retired in favor of two sets of impact metrics: &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>Vulnerable System Impact – Confidentiality (VC), Integrity (VI), Availability (VA)  &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Subsequent System(s) Impact – Confidentiality (SC), Integrity (SI), Availability (SA) &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"misc\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">MISC: &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these changes, CVSS v4.0 provides improved guidance to CVSS analysts to produce consistent scores, guidance on scoring vulnerabilities in software libraries etc. CVSS v4.0 is designed to support multiple CVSS scores for the same vulnerability that affects multiple products, platforms, operating systems, etc. It also provides guidance to extend the CVSS framework for other industry sectors such as privacy, automotive, etc. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-cvss-4-0-compare-to-trurisk\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does CVSS 4.0 compare to TruRisk? &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS 4.0 represents a decent upgrade compared to CVSS 3.1, primarily due to the renaming of key metrics such as Temporal to Threat Metrics. This change makes it much easier for end users to evaluate the severity of a vulnerability. The inclusion of fine-grained details regarding user interaction required for vulnerability exploitation is also a welcome addition. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, alongside the beneficial changes in version 4.0, there is also an increase in complexity. One longstanding issue with CVSS ratings has been the potential for inconsistencies in how individuals/vendors rate vulnerabilities. Moreover, with the introduction of more variables, the resulting scores can vary. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, when assessing the risk of a vulnerability, the key metric that truly matters is the exploitability (which CVSS 4.0 addresses), evidence of exploitation (which it does not), and the likelihood of exploitation (as referenced by EPSS). &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal score is one that takes into account the CVSS rating to evaluate the technical severity and combines it with the exploitability factors referenced above. This is where TruRisk scores come into play, as it assists organizations in assessing the true risk of a vulnerability by considering multiple factors. These scores are designed to be easily understandable, even for non-technical teams, and greatly simplify the implementation of risk-based vulnerability management.

However, this may begin by Q1 2024, following the estimated adoption trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Will the introduction of CVSS v4 affect my TruRisk scores?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rollout of CVSS v4 is not expected to impact TruRisk scores directly. These scores should remain consistent pre- and post-introduction of CVSS v4.0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 provides consumers with fine, granular metrics to better understand the technical characteristics of vulnerabilities. With the simplification of Temporal Metrics along with the addition of granular Base and Environmental Metrics, it aims to help consumers better understand the risk of vulnerabilities. With the addition of Supplemental Metrics, CVSS v4.0 consumers will be able to better communicate extrinsic characteristics of vulnerabilities, which will help customers better assess their risk and drive effective remediation.  &nbsp;</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/02/cvss-v4-is-now-live-and-what-do-you-need-to-know/feed","slash:comments":"0","authorTitle":{"#cdata-section":"Product Manager - Threat Research Unit, Qualys"},"authorAvatar":{"#cdata-section":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cf1c318454e3694de9a913fb0313e42c?s=192&d=mm&r=g"},"authorPosts":{"#cdata-section":"https://blog.qualys.com/author/sabbasi"},"postCategory":{"name":{"#cdata-section":"Product and Tech"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://blog.qualys.com/category/product-tech"}},"customExcerpt":{"#cdata-section":"\n<p>On November 1st, 2023, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 4 (CVSS v4) was officially launched in General Availability (GA) following a period of public preview and feedback collection.

This timeframe is also when we foresee a broader uptake of CVSS v4 beginning to take shape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cvss-v3-1-vs-cvss-v4-0\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CVSS v3.1 Vs CVSS v4.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure below provides an overview of the changes between CVSS v3.1 vs CVSS v4.0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"606\" data-attachment-id=\"34333\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/02/cvss-v4-is-now-live-and-what-do-you-need-to-know/attachment/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-2\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem.png\" data-orig-size=\"1100,623\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-300x170.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-1070x606.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-1070x606.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34333\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-1070x606.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-300x170.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem-768x435.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/common-vulnerability-scoring-sysytem.png 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-new-in-cvss-v4-0\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is New In CVSS v4.0? </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nomenclature</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CVSS framework always consisted of three metric groups, i.e. Base, Temporal, and Environment.  However, due to the popularity of the CVSS Base Score, it became synonymous with the overall CVSS score. CVSS score is not just a base case.  To stress the importance of this, the following new nomenclature was adopted by CVSS v4:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>CVSS Nomenclature</strong></th><th class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>CVSS Metrics Used</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-B&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BE</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base and Environmental metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BT&nbsp;</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base and Threat metrics&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">CVSS-BTE</td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">Base, Threat, Environmental metrics</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Supplemental Metric Group &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 introduces a new optional metric group called the “Supplemental Metric Group.” It provides metrics that describe and measure additional extrinsic attributes of a vulnerability. The Supplemental Metric Group aims to provide contextual information that consumers can use to take additional actions that help them in further risk analysis. It is important to note that Supplemental metrics are optional, and they do not have any impact on the calculated CVSS scores. Supplemental metrics to help you better understand extrinsic questions about vulnerabilities include: &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Safety&nbsp;</td><td>Does exploiting this vulnerability have a safety impact on an organization?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Automatable&nbsp;</td><td>Are attackers able to automate exploitation of this vulnerability?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Recovery&nbsp;</td><td>After an attack are the systems/component able to self-recover?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Provide Urgency&nbsp;</td><td>What is the rating provided by the vendor for this vulnerability?&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Value Density&nbsp;</td><td>What resources will the attacker gain control over with a single exploitation event?&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Base Metric: Attack Requirement (AT): &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Attack Requirement (AT) metric aims to provide more granularity than provided by the “Attack Complexity (AC)” metric. This new metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attack Complexity – Reflect the exploit engineering complexity required to evade or circumvent defensive or security-enhancing technologies. (Defensive measures) &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attack Requirements – Reflect the prerequisite conditions of the vulnerable component that make the attack possible. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-was-updated-removed-in-cvss-v4-0\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-large-font-size\">What was updated/removed in CVSS v4.0? &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rename and Simplified Threat Metrics: &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 renamed the “Temporal” Metric from CVSS v3.1 to “Threat Metrics.” CVSS v4.0 also retired the “Remediation Level (RL)” and “Report Confidence (RC)” metrics. In addition, the “Exploit Code Maturity (E)” was renamed to “Exploit Maturity (E).” The “High (H)” and “Functional (F)” values for this metric in CVSS v3.1 were also merged into one value of “Attacked (A)” in CVSS v4.0. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Base Metric:  User Interaction (UI): &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component. CVSS v4.0 proposes the User Interaction (UI) metric to be more granular. CVSS v3.1 the User Interaction (UI) metric had values None(N) or Required(R). With CVSS v4.0 this metric now provides more granularity to the amount of interaction required as Passive (P) or Active (A). See more details at:  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document</a>  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Retired Base Metric: Scope (S):  &nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the CVSS v3.1 Base Metric of Scope(S) was retired in CVSS v4.0 due to the lack of clarity on the usage of this metric. This led to inconsistent scoring among vulnerabilities by different product providers. Due to this reason, the Scope Metric was retired in favor of two sets of impact metrics: &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>Vulnerable System Impact – Confidentiality (VC), Integrity (VI), Availability (VA)  &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Subsequent System(s) Impact – Confidentiality (SC), Integrity (SI), Availability (SA) &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"misc\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">MISC: &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these changes, CVSS v4.0 provides improved guidance to CVSS analysts to produce consistent scores, guidance on scoring vulnerabilities in software libraries etc. CVSS v4.0 is designed to support multiple CVSS scores for the same vulnerability that affects multiple products, platforms, operating systems, etc. It also provides guidance to extend the CVSS framework for other industry sectors such as privacy, automotive, etc. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-cvss-4-0-compare-to-trurisk\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does CVSS 4.0 compare to TruRisk? &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS 4.0 represents a decent upgrade compared to CVSS 3.1, primarily due to the renaming of key metrics such as Temporal to Threat Metrics. This change makes it much easier for end users to evaluate the severity of a vulnerability. The inclusion of fine-grained details regarding user interaction required for vulnerability exploitation is also a welcome addition. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, alongside the beneficial changes in version 4.0, there is also an increase in complexity. One longstanding issue with CVSS ratings has been the potential for inconsistencies in how individuals/vendors rate vulnerabilities. Moreover, with the introduction of more variables, the resulting scores can vary. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, when assessing the risk of a vulnerability, the key metric that truly matters is the exploitability (which CVSS 4.0 addresses), evidence of exploitation (which it does not), and the likelihood of exploitation (as referenced by EPSS). &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal score is one that takes into account the CVSS rating to evaluate the technical severity and combines it with the exploitability factors referenced above. This is where TruRisk scores come into play, as it assists organizations in assessing the true risk of a vulnerability by considering multiple factors. These scores are designed to be easily understandable, even for non-technical teams, and greatly simplify the implementation of risk-based vulnerability management.

However, this may begin by Q1 2024, following the estimated adoption trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Will the introduction of CVSS v4 affect my TruRisk scores?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rollout of CVSS v4 is not expected to impact TruRisk scores directly. These scores should remain consistent pre- and post-introduction of CVSS v4.0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CVSS v4.0 provides consumers with fine, granular metrics to better understand the technical characteristics of vulnerabilities. With the simplification of Temporal Metrics along with the addition of granular Base and Environmental Metrics, it aims to help consumers better understand the risk of vulnerabilities. With the addition of Supplemental Metrics, CVSS v4.0 consumers will be able to better communicate extrinsic characteristics of vulnerabilities, which will help customers better assess their risk and drive effective remediation.  &nbsp;</p>\n"}},{"title":"Explaining the Business Value of Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform to Your Leadership","link":"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/01/explaining-the-business-value-of-qualys-enterprise-trurisk-platform-to-your-leadership","comments":"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/01/explaining-the-business-value-of-qualys-enterprise-trurisk-platform-to-your-leadership#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Thomas Nuth"},"pubDate":"Wed, 01 Nov 2023 13:00:47 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Product and Tech"},{"#cdata-section":"leadership"},{"#cdata-section":"trurisk"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://blog.qualys.com/?p=34315"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"New IDC White Paper Reports Findings by Qualys Customers&#160; As a cybersecurity leader, you may struggle to help your C-suite see the business value of what your team does.

Forget “speeds and feeds”; key decision-makers are solely focused on The Numbers. While reports from most security tools excel at spewing out numbers, their technology-focused integers rarely address the nuts and bolts of managing corporate finance and business risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you with this challenge, Qualys commissioned IDC to conduct a business value deep dive with several of our enterprise customers in various industry sectors. The goal is to reveal how Qualys customers perceive business value. Based on the resulting research in the IDC White Paper, The Business Value of Qualys, IDC describes three fundamental numbers that will help you frame the business value of using the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform with your c-suite:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-34315\"></span>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Average Annual Benefit: <strong>$102,000 per 1,000 internal users</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3-year Return on Investment: <strong>403% </strong>or <strong>$5.1 million per year</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payback Period: <strong>5 months</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>IDC found these business value metrics were enabled by three Qualys capabilities. The first is <em>boosting the overall efficiency</em> of security teams with faster detection and response to threats. The second is <em>enabling greater productivity</em> for IT infrastructure, DevOps, and compliance teams. The third is <em>significantly lowering trouble incidents</em> such as security breaches, unplanned application downtime, and fines for non-compliance. Let’s take a closer look at how these findings apply.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-the-right-language-with-your-leadership\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using the Right Language with Your Leadership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The urgency of having a strong cybersecurity posture is well understood. It’s the constant news of cyber breaches that keeps board members and executives up at night. With cyber threats, the entire business is at stake, and the stakeholders fret about whether their organization’s defenses can manage the risk. As a security leader, one of your roles is helping stakeholders understand that risk is under control – or at least in the process of significant reduction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an easy mistake for a security leader to speak to stakeholders in security lingo – using industry terminology for arcane solutions and processes that are second nature to you but gibberish to corporate finance and risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the top of the figure below shows six major concepts used to describe the reduction of cyber risk with the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform. These are terms you hear in the industry and see in marketing collateral and on our website. The bottom part shows how you can describe these concepts in business terms. Using business-friendly language is vital for connecting with the leadership, including CFOs, CISOs, and CIOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"two-languages-of-risk\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two Languages of Risk</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"389\" data-attachment-id=\"34328\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/01/explaining-the-business-value-of-qualys-enterprise-trurisk-platform-to-your-leadership/attachment/image-53\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"1920,698\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-300x109.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1070x389.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1070x389.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34328\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1070x389.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-300x109.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-768x279.png 768w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1536x558.png 1536w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"c-suite-soundbites-for-business-value-of-qualys\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">C-Suite Soundbites for Business Value of Qualys&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are six number-focused soundbites to help you describe the business value of Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform to your leadership. All are discoveries made by IDC analysts as they explored how Qualys customers perceive business value from the platform. Each supports the three top business value points noted in this blog’s introduction and is detailed in the IDC White Paper, The Business Value of Qualys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"roi\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">ROI&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IDC discovered Qualys users get a return on investment (ROI) of 403%. This is money returned in two ways. There is a lower total cost of investment (TCO) achieved by eliminating point solutions that are integrated with the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform. ROI is also achieved by reducing manual processes with streamlined workflows and automation enabled by the platform. As they say, “Time is money” – especially the fixed costs of labor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"payback\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Payback&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Payback is how quickly you reach a net dollar zero cost/benefit of the initial investment in Qualys. Payback for the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform is five months. This accelerated timeline occurs with the platform approach using three or more integrated solutions. Platform adoption by multiple teams streamlines workflows across departmental boundaries such as IT, security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"total-value\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Total Value&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Total value is ROI plus related qualitative value from investing in the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform. IDC reports Qualys customers interviewed for its study are each getting a total value of $5.1 million per year. This return climbs exponentially over time and as additional integrated solutions are added to the platform by customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"staff-time-efficiency\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Staff Time Efficiency&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A primary enabler of staff time efficiency is operationalizing SecOps with the Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform. IDC reports Qualys users are achieving 24% more efficiency by security teams. Mean time to repair (MTTR) improved up to 50% with bidirectional integrations of ITSM and CMDB tools. An improved four-hour mean time to discover (MTTD) was six times faster than competitive platforms with less than 24-hour response for critical CVEs. The platform enabled two-second visibility across a hybrid infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"risk-reduction\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risk Reduction&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of risk reduction have three primary sources, according to Qualys customers interviewed by IDC. These include 65% fewer unplanned application outages, a 66% improvement in quicker resolution of outages, and a 24% reduction in fines for non-compliance. Unplanned outages are avoided with proactive security measures guided by 25+ threat intelligence sources and Qualys Threat Research findings and the platform’s ability to see all external-facing assets for stronger supply chain security. Faster resolution of outages is achieved with the platform’s bi-directional data flows between tools and an 89% observed improvement in patching. Better compliance is achieved with 86% coverage of MITRE ATT&amp;CK guidance and support and reporting for 850 policies, 20,000 controls, and 100 regulations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"security-staff-key-performance-indicators\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Security Staff Key Performance Indicators&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Three KPIs for security staff were improved with Qualys Enterprise TruRisk Platform, according to IDC’s study. Staff were 56% more effective at proactively detecting threats thanks to the platform’s growing database of 85,000+ CVEs. Staff were 40% more efficient in responding to potential threats. Better efficiency was helped by reducing up to 85% of vulnerabilities due to risk-based prioritization and the use of the platform’s automated workflow logic with scripts. Staff were 37% more efficient with patching, closing tickets 60% faster – including remediation of vulnerabilities in custom first-party software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-more-read-the-idc-whitepaper\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn More: Read the IDC Whitepaper&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDC White Paper concluded: “Service providers like Qualys are stepping up to the plate with greater capabilities that enable cybersecurity teams to raise the bar on overall risk management across the breadth of the IT estate.” To further help you engage in meaningful communication with your leadership about the business value of Qualys, I invite you to <a href=\"https://qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/transform-cybersecurity-from-cost-center-to-business-driver/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/transform-cybersecurity-from-cost-center-to-business-driver/\">download the IDC whitepaper</a> for more insights, along with many quotes by security leaders like you who use Qualys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Download the IDC whitepaper for more insights</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-fill\" style=\"margin: 0 auto 1em; text-align: center;\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background\" href=\"https://qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/transform-cybersecurity-from-cost-center-to-business-driver/\" style=\"background-color:#ed2e26\">Download the IDC Whitepaper </a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>IDC White Paper, sponsored by Qualys, The Business Value of Qualys, #US51057523, November 2023&nbsp;</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/11/01/explaining-the-business-value-of-qualys-enterprise-trurisk-platform-to-your-leadership/feed","slash:comments":"0","authorTitle":{"#cdata-section":"Vice President, Product Marketing, Qualys"},"authorAvatar":{"#cdata-section":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d18ac6e431cd7909b979ed54d77012ce?s=192&d=mm&r=g"},"authorPosts":{"#cdata-section":"https://blog.qualys.com/author/tnuth"},"postCategory":{"name":{"#cdata-section":"Product and Tech"},"link":{"#cdata-section":"https://blog.qualys.com/category/product-tech"}},"customExcerpt":{"#cdata-section":"\n<h2 id=\"new-idc-white-paper-reports-findings-by-qualys-customers\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">New IDC White Paper Reports Findings by Qualys Customers&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a cybersecurity leader, you may struggle to help your C-suite see the business value of what your team does.

It also centralizes the documentation of evidence where misconfigurations and lapses have been discovered or fixed. Policy Compliance provides proof of compliance across industry standards, regulations, benchmarks, frameworks, and mandates that help harden and secure host systems against existing threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog post, let’s discuss how to obtain Policy Compliance Data via Posture Streaming (PCRS) API. Discover Policy List, Host IDs, and Posture Information data in compressed JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) form and into the latest timestamped, point-in-time SQLite database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help programmers realize this goal, we are providing a blueprint of example code called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/qualysetl/\">QualysETL</a> that is open-sourced under the Apache 2 License for your organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed further, here’s a list of benefits from Policy Compliance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Policy Compliance Provides Organizations With</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced compliance with CIS &amp; configuration management</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Over 850 policies &amp; 19K+ controls mitigate audit failures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Out-of-the-box policies reduce efforts from days to minutes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom reporting &amp; dashboard ensure you are audit-ready.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Auto-discovery &amp; OCA (Out of Band Configuration Assessment) coverage eliminates blind spots.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>98% less time and cost</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ROI (return on investment) &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/policy-compliance/\">43% Potential cost savings &amp; risk reduction</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>(Application Programming Interface) such as the <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-api-vmpc-user-guide.pdf\">Posture Streaming API (PCRS) for Automation.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Qualys application programming interface (API) allows programmers to derive maximum benefit from Policy Compliance data.

In this step, you execute API calls to extract Qualys Policy Compliance data from our platform, including Policy, Hosts, and Posture Information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transform </strong>refers to reading the resulting extracted data from Qualys and transforming it into other forms or formats your organization decides will be useful (e.g., SQL, DDL, or CSV). The Transform step is your opportunity to prepare and enhance the PCRS data, for example, injecting security intelligence specific to your environment that will help drive remediation. Examples of this include data classification or application owner to prioritize risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Load </strong>refers to loading the data into its final form on disk for independent analysis (e.g., SQLite) and/or distributing Qualys data to its destination in the cloud for use in metrics or visualization tools such as PowerBI or Tableau.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"automation-challenges\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automation Challenges<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With any API, there are inherent automation challenges.

In this step, you execute API calls to extract Qualys Policy Compliance data from our platform, including Policy, Hosts, and Posture Information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transform </strong>refers to reading the resulting extracted data from Qualys and transforming it into other forms or formats your organization decides will be useful (e.g., SQL, DDL, or CSV). The Transform step is your opportunity to prepare and enhance the PCRS data, for example, injecting security intelligence specific to your environment that will help drive remediation. Examples of this include data classification or application owner to prioritize risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Load </strong>refers to loading the data into its final form on disk for independent analysis (e.g., SQLite) and/or distributing Qualys data to its destination in the cloud for use in metrics or visualization tools such as PowerBI or Tableau.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"automation-challenges\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automation Challenges<strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With any API, there are inherent automation challenges.
