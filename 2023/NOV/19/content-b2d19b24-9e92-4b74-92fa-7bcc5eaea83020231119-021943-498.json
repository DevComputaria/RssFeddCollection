It defines four forms\n    of teams and three modes of team\n    interactions. The model encourages healthy interactions that allow \n    business-capability centric teams to flourish in their task of providing a\n    steady flow of valuable software.</p>\n\n<p>The primary kind of team in this framework is the <b>stream-aligned\n    team</b>, a <a href=\"/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html\">Business Capability Centric</a> team that is\n    responsible for software for a single business capability. These are\n    long-running teams, thinking of their efforts as providing a <a href=\"/articles/products-over-projects.html\">software\n    product</a> to enhance the business capability.</p>\n\n<p>Each stream-aligned team is full-stack and full-lifecycle: responsible for\n    front-end, back-end, database,\n    business analysis, feature prioritization,\n    UX, testing, deployment, monitoring - the\n    whole enchilada of software development.\n    They are <a href=\"/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html\">Outcome Oriented</a>, focused on business outcomes rather than <a href=\"/bliki/ActivityOriented.html\">Activity Oriented</a> teams focused on a function such as business\n    analysis, testing, or databases.\n    But they also shouldn't be too\n    large, ideally each one is a <a href=\"/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html\">Two Pizza Team</a>. A large\n    organization will have many such teams, and while they have different\n    business capabilities to support, they have common needs such as data\n    storage, network communications, and observability.</p>\n\n<p>A small team like this calls for ways to reduce their cognitive load, so they\n    can concentrate on supporting the business needs, not on (for example) data\n    storage issues. An important part of doing this is to build on a platform\n    that takes care of these non-focal concerns. For many teams a platform can\n    be a widely available third party platform, such as Ruby on Rails for a\n    database-backed web application. But for many products there is no\n    single off-the-shelf platform to use, a team is going to have to find and\n    integrate several platforms. In a larger organization they will have to\n    access a range of internal services and follow corporate standards.</p>\n\n<p>This problem can be addressed by building an internal platform for the\n    organization. Such a platform can do that integration of third-party\n    services, near-complete platforms, and internal services. Team Topologies\n    classifies the team that builds this (unimaginatively-but-wisely) as a <b>platform\n    team</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Smaller organizations can work with a single platform team, which\n    produces a thin layer over an externally provided set of products. Larger\n    platforms, however, require more people than can be fed with two-pizzas.\n    The authors are thus moving to describe a <b>platform grouping</b>\n    of many platform teams.</p>\n\n<p>An important characteristic of a platform is that it's designed to be used\n    in a mostly self-service fashion. The stream-aligned teams are still\n    responsible for the operation of their product, and direct their use of the\n    platform without expecting an elaborate collaboration with the platform team.\n    In the Team Topologies framework, this interaction mode is referred to as\n    <b>X-as-a-Service mode</b>, with the platform acting as a service to the\n    stream-aligned teams.</p>\n\n<p>Platform teams, however, need to build their services as products\n    themselves, with a deep understanding of their customer's needs. This often\n    requires that they use a different interaction mode, one of <b>collaboration\n    mode</b>, while they build that service. Collaboration mode is a more\n    intensive partnership form of interaction, and should be seen as a temporary\n    approach until the platform is mature enough to move to x-as-a service\n    mode.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the model doesn't represent anything particularly inventive.\n    Breaking organizations down between business-aligned and technology support\n    teams is an approach as old as enterprise software. In recent years, plenty\n    of writers have expressed the importance of making these business capability\n    teams be responsible for the full-stack and the full-lifecycle. For me, the\n    bright insight of Team Topologies is focusing on the problem that having\n    business-aligned teams that are full-stack and full-lifecycle means that\n    they are often faced with an excessive cognitive load, which works against\n    the desire for small, responsive teams. The key benefit of a\n    platform is that it <i>reduces this cognitive load</i>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"soundbyte\" style=\"padding-left: 5em; font-style: italic\">\n<p>A crucial insight of Team Topologies is that the primary benefit of a\n    platform is to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned\n    teams</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This insight has profound implications. For a start it alters how\n    platform teams should think about the platform. Reducing client teams'\n    cognitive load leads to different design decisions and product roadmap to\n    platforms intended primarily for standardization or cost-reduction. \n    Beyond the platform this insight leads Team Topologies to develop their model\n    further by identifying two more kinds of team.</p>\n\n<p>Some capabilities require specialists who can put considerable time and\n    energy into mastering a topic important to many stream-aligned teams. A\n    security specialist may spend more time studying security issues and\n    interacting with the broader security community than would be possible as a\n    member of a stream-aligned team. Such people congregate in <b>enabling\n    teams</b>, whose role is to grow relevant skills inside other teams\n    so that those teams can remain independent and better own and evolve their\n    services.\n    To achieve this enabling teams primarily use the third and final interaction\n    mode in Team Topologies. <b>Facilitating mode</b>\n    involves a coaching role, where the enabling team isn't there to write and\n    ensure conformance to standards, but instead to educate and coach their colleagues so\n    that the stream-aligned teams become more autonomous.</p>\n\n<p>Stream-aligned teams are responsible for the whole stream of value for their\n    customers, but occasionally we find aspects of a stream-aligned team's work\n    that is sufficiently demanding that it needs a dedicated group to focus on\n    it, leading to the fourth and final type of team:\n    <b>complicated-subsystem team</b>. The goal of a complicated-subsystem\n    team is to reduce the cognitive load of the stream-aligned teams that use\n    that complicated subsystem. That's a worthwhile division even if there's\n    only one client team for that subsystem. Mostly complicated-subsystem teams strive to interact\n    with their clients using x-as-a service mode, but will need to\n    use collaboration mode for short periods.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure \"><img src=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/team-topologies/diagram.png\">\n<p class=\"photoCaption\">\n      Team Topologies includes a set of graphical symbols to illustrate teams\n      and their relationships.

The term\n  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.</p>\n\n<p>The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The\n  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed\n  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which\n  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a\n  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I\n  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience\n  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.</p>\n\n<p>Although the name focuses solely on the size, just as important is the\n  team's focus. A two-pizza team should have all the capabilities it needs to\n  delivery valuable software to its users, with minimal hand-offs and\n  dependencies on other teams. They can figure out what their customer needs,\n  and quickly translate that into working software, able to experiment and\n  evolve that software as their customer's needs change.</p>\n\n<p>Two-pizza teams are <a href=\"/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html\">Outcome Oriented</a> rather than\n  <a href=\"/bliki/ActivityOriented.html\">Activity Oriented</a>. They don't organize along lines of skills\n  (databases, testing, operations), instead they take on all the responsibilities\n  required to support their customers. This minimizes inter-team hand-offs in the\n  flow of features to their customers, allowing them to reduce the cycle-time\n  (the time required to turn an idea for a feature into code running in\n  production). This outcome-orientation also means they deploy code into\n  production and monitor its use there, famously responsible for any production\n  outages (often meaning they on the hook for off-hours support) - a principle\n  known as \"you build it, you run it\".</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on a customer need like this means teams are long-lived, <a href=\"/bliki/BusinessCapabilityCentric.html\">Business Capability Centric</a> teams that support their business\n  capability as long as that capability is active. Unlike project-oriented teams -\n  that disband when the software is \"done\" - they think of themselves as\n  enabling and enhancing a <a href=\"/articles/products-over-projects.html\">long-lived\n  product</a>. This aspect often leads to them being referred to as <b>product\n  teams</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The wide scope of skills and responsibilities that a two-pizza team needs\n  to support its product means that although such teams can be the primary\n  approach to team organization, they need support from a well-constructed\n  software platform. For small organizations, this can be a commercial platform,\n  such as a modern cloud offering. Larger organizations will create their own\n  internal platforms to make it easier for their two-pizza teams to collaborate\n  without creating difficult hand-offs. <a href=\"/bliki/TeamTopologies.html\">Team Topologies</a>\n  provides a good way to think about the different kinds of teams and\n  interactions required to support two-pizza teams (Team Topologies calls them\n  <b>stream-aligned teams</b>).</p>\n\n<p>For business-capability centric teams to be effective, they will need to\n  make use of each others' capabilities. Teams will thus need to provide their\n  capabilities to their peers, often though thoughtfully designed APIs. This\n  responsibility for such teams to provide services to their peers is often\n  overlooked, if it doesn't happen it will lead to sclerotic information\n  silos.</p>\n\n<p>Organizing people around business capabilities like this has a profound\n  interaction with the way the software for an organization is structured - due\n  to the effect of <a href=\"/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html\">Conways Law</a>.
