In addition, Apple forbids the use of fingerprinting on mobile apps. Read on to learn more about the requirements that you’ll need to comply with or risk the App Store blocking your app from being updated or accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Pillars</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple regards privacy as a fundamental human right and one of its core values. The company’s multi-layered approach to data privacy includes four principles that it uses when thinking about the privacy of Apple products and services. The four Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10053/?time=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy pillars</a> are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data minimization &#8211; Reduces amount of information collected&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On-device processing &#8211; Makes it so data doesn’t necessarily need to leave the device or be stored on the server</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transparency and control &#8211; Empowers users to make better decisions and remove access to data when necessary or desired&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security protections &#8211; protecting data in transit, on the file system or store it correctly in the keychain, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21962\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic.png 600w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-main-points-graphic-360x480.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Nutrition Labels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Apple debuted <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/labels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy Nutrition Labels </a>to help users learn more about how mobile apps collect and use their data so they can make good choices. The labels cover three categories:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data Used to Track You</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data Linked to You</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data Not Linked to You</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"401\" height=\"835\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21963\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic.png 401w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-iOS-graphic-360x750.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On Dec. 8, 2020, Apple began requiring developers to complete the data collection disclosures for mobile apps upon submitting them to the App Store. While this information provides much-needed transparency, it’s entirely self reported by developers and based on the honor system. That means some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Privacy Nutrition Labels may be inaccurate</a>, either due to bad intent by the mobile app maker or more likely, because iOS developers lack insight into the privacy practices of the many third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use to build their mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Apple privacy manifests aim to bridge that gap. While the Privacy Nutrition Labels help users decide which mobile apps to trust, privacy manifests provide useful information to mobile app developers about the privacy practices of their dependencies stemming from third-party SDKs. Because SDKs have major implications for mobile app privacy, privacy manifests will old developers more accountable for accurately representing third-party code they include in their builds in their Privacy Nutrition Labels.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tWe’ve been working on crafting tools that will help easily ensure the privacy and security of the application while minimizing App Store surprises.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n        <cite>&#8211; NowSecure CTO David Weinstein</cite>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple Privacy Manifests</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A privacy manifest captures details about both first and third-party code in your mobile apps. In <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developer documentation</a>, Apple defines the privacy manifest as a “property list that records the types of data collected by your app or third-party SDK, and the required reason APIs your app or third-party SDK uses.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has prepared a list of iOS functionality that has the potential to impact privacy and be misused for fingerprinting. It calls these <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">required reason APIs</a>. They include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>File timestamp APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>System boot time APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disk space APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Active keyboard APIs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User defaults APIs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the above categories, Apple lists approved reasons to access these APIs based on their use cases. For example, one required reason API is NSFileSystemFreeSize, which indicates the amount of free space on the file system. One approved reason allowing this use is to leverage this API to check whether there’s sufficient disk space before writing files to disk. But if your mobile app is a flashlight or calculator, for instance, it shouldn’t need access to disk space or active keyboard APIs according to <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/privacy-by-design?x=LIaYZt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">privacy by design principles</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When developers incorporate any required reason APIs into their mobile apps, they must choose one or more approved reasons that accurately reflect their use of each of those APIs and the data derived from their use. To protect users from possible fingerprinting, Apple allows apps and SDKs to access the required reason APIs only for approved reasons. Developers declare this information as part of the process of completing  privacy manifest files in Xcode. If your mobile app uses a required reason API to benefit users for a reason that Apple doesn’t list, you can submit a request for a new approved reason.</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_93b1510094ced7f75c045bb9afe8f7b5\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"featured-image-holder js-featured-image-holder\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle='background-image: url(\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphical-CTA-500x500-v2-500x400.png\")'\n\t\t\t\t></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy &amp; Security for Developers &#8211; NowSecure Observer\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-right justify-content-end\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Read More</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Store Enforcement Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will offer a grace period for developers to become familiar with the forthcoming privacy requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Beginning in<strong> fall 2023</strong>, Apple will email developers via when an app uses a privacy-impacting SDK without providing a privacy manifest or taps a required reason API without specifying a valid explanation in the privacy manifest. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting in <strong>spring 2024</strong>, the privacy manifest will become mandatory and Apple will begin enforcing that requirement as part of the app review process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-960x502.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21964\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-960x502.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-360x188.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic-768x402.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-apple-requir-graphic.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To recap, mobile app developers should now prepare for the privacy changes that will arrive soon. “Reviewing Apple’s evolving privacy requirements, we can see that in 2020, Privacy Nutrition Labels were introduced,” said Weinstein. “At WWDC 23, privacy manifests were introduced. And finally in 2024, we can expect manifest enforcement as mentioned by Apple in its developer documentation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing NowSecure Observer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure sees the opportunity to aid iOS developers in complying with the new Apple privacy mandates. “We’ve been working on crafting tools that will help easily ensure the privacy and security of the application while minimizing App Store surprises,” Weinstein said. Providing greater visibility to sensitive data flows will empower devs to better meet privacy requirements while boosting <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/6-ways-secure-mobile-app-development-efficiency?x=LIaYZt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DevSecOps efficiency</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently available in beta, the <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-observer/\">NowSecure Observer </a>developer tool simplifies mobile privacy and security during the coding stage. It provides real-time visibility into how sensitive data is being used, stored and transmitted by first- and third-party code. It also enables developers to quickly resolve security and privacy issues and avoid App Store surprises and rejections.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-960x617.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21965\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-960x617.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-360x231.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic-768x494.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/decoding-apple-priv-observer-graphic.png 977w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once developers add it to their iOS project, the NowSecure Observer SDK collects telemetry as the developer codes and at runtime.

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors in software systems and mobile apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Integrated Development Environments (IDE) come with built-in debugging tools that enable a developer to review the inner workings of your projects line by line, but occasionally these debuggers may not be able to achieve exactly what you want. Even worse, if you’re checking for bugs, reverse engineering, performing <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing</a> or analyzing performance on a mobile app for which you do not have the source code, debugging can quickly become a very daunting task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you lack access to an app’s source code, you can debug an app by conducting static or dynamic analysis. In this post, we will discuss how to leverage <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/frida/\">Frida</a> for manual dynamic analysis to understand the inner workings of an application.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/NSConnect23?promo=FridaNSBlogC23&amp;tr=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-960x502.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21855\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-960x502.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-360x188.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card-768x402.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SV2-Radare-Frida-win-a-call-social-card.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Frida?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frida is a free, open-source dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse engineers, and security researchers created and supported in part by NowSecure researchers. Frida can be used on a variety of different platforms, such as Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and embedded systems. The framework allows users to hook into the memory of running processes and view or manipulate the inner workings of the application. Frida hooks are typically written in <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Javascript</a>, though Frida provides bindings for multiple other <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/c-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leverage the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The large community of Frida enthusiasts generously provides tools and scripts utilizing Frida’s capabilities to assist developers and researchers around the world. You can find these tools in various places on the Internet, however, the official place to find premade Frida scripts is <a href=\"https://codeshare.frida.re/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frida CodeShare</a>. This section will touch on just a few of these helpful publicly accessible tools/scripts. We encourage you to search for more or even contribute your own creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To easily use scripts from the CodeShare, run Frida with the codeshare flag:<br><code>frida --codeshare &lt;author&gt;/&lt;the-script-name&gt; -f &lt;package-name&gt;</code><br><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using this on a device connected via USB, add the&nbsp;<code>-U</code>&nbsp;flag</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the script isn’t included on the CodeShare, you’ll need to save the script to a Javascript file and run it with the following command:<br><code>frida -l &lt;path-to-script&gt; -f &lt;package-name&gt;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tFrida is a very capable debugging tool that should have a place in every developer’s toolkit.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Class/Method Inspection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to see what classes or methods are being used while an application is running. You can use these Frida scripts to log any time a specific class or method is called. In addition, every argument that is used will also be displayed alongside the method’s return value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">iOS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For iOS, <a href=\"https://github.com/0xdea/frida-scripts/blob/master/raptor_frida_ios_trace.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this script</a> provides an easy way to hook Objective-C or native methods. To use it, pass the method declaration that you’re interested in as an argument to the trace function at the bottom of the script. For example, if you wanted to hook any classes that have a method name that ends with the word “Password”, you could use this:<br><code>*[* *Password:*]</code><br>If this syntax looks confusing, you may want to check out <a href=\"https://roadfiresoftware.com/2014/06/how-to-read-and-write-method-declarations-in-objective-c/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this explanation</a> of Objective-C method declarations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FUv8cXD055O_Q7DCPwQ8CdHbgfZSWDt4TZaN-cvHUgwWvwOBMvfTHGGepeEYpdbNUC5nTX_HYF1uLrWiMs1_W6iR04ihVby3IlW_YTr6TMcTyLhQxtIPEMUq7cANtwsaG_oIKH1hcf838WH8npyOSUc\"></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Android</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For Android, use <a href=\"https://github.com/iddoeldor/frida-snippets/blob/master/scripts/trace_class.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this script</a> to hook all Java methods for the provided class. This script is used by placing the full class name in the array at the bottom or by calling <code>traceClass()</code> directly. For example, if you wanted to hook all methods from the <code>SecretKeySpec</code> class, you could use this:<br><code>traceClass(“javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec”)</code></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q5x24i_JgCmrk2-XUS37PaVQ9tHSMAjA3h2Qf30rDZqjt81Yr76a8SV2a4oZUcNDyChz4E_Zu0FbnP1L4dhzIyKg4Ty1bD6Mldzl8U6GNoWbnjZpwk-8trhSKlGOQXtIwTcsVsHSXqpdHxxfjKrZf5I\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">View File Interactions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally you may want to inspect what’s getting read from or written to disk. You can use this <a href=\"https://codeshare.frida.re/@FrenchYeti/android-file-system-access-hook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">File System Access script</a> to accomplish that. This script will display every file creation, open, read, and write that an Android app performs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mqhoJkcWcWtSXpH_W4zDc8ZRILcwkD8wwI-8y4jZZ5M2Z0WRFBuroNkb2SBW_nzLt322ksaMBMce5FgWKGUKWX_JJ7xIdZaiIax8E-IGEt_N99_METUrE9KTlRcrNg1RigG6HECKN2Wx1e8adow4ZpI\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dump Application Memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An application’s memory can contain all sorts of sensitive or useful information. The easy-to-use tool <a href=\"https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fridump</a> allows you to quickly dump app memory to disk for further analysis. You can use it with:<br><code>python3 fridump.py -U -o memory_dump &lt;app-name&gt;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Gt5Zpkel8Lhqm2CW2Tz0o7-anpQdJS5fVdM2aKcn_EVSYhSy5930K_wqkuwVeJWqYdo3lbVxzeR52eexCzan97nIuQgpEqu7p4dghN5yXkzHNIflsZNpC3a1RK1m17Tz9CybMPBpesWbbhicCsD9muw\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can search for passwords, API keys, unobfuscated strings, debug symbols and other sensitive information by running <code>strings</code> on the output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trace Method Calls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">frida-trace</a> allows you to dynamically trace function calls by providing class/method names. frida-trace also allows for wildcards, so you can hook multiple calls at once without knowing the complete method names. For example, if you want to monitor the Java cryptographic libraries of an application, you could use:<br><code>frida-trace -U -f &lt;app-package-name&gt; -j '*crypto*!*/i'</code><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"624\" height=\"156\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dkDEmSDYUX3LO4K6PLC1os3DUR_903rctudity5uBCNRhos597yzlA603rsrpcjFumjyZbdaJPNP3VTykcjWo5vff4620w3ddcaQKNcJqVVlUfrCEAADvkWSQbLgv-qo_HP8sfRe8wbi7IxwUtbKjSw\"><br>In the above instance, there were 925 matches for methods that had crypto in the class name. Upon launching the app, it was determined that this app uses AES GCM. The trace also shows the IV that was used to initialize the cipher. From here, you could narrow down your tracing to only classes related to AES GCM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Writing Your Own Scripts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to using prebuilt tools and scripts, it can be helpful to know how to write a basic Frida script. Occasionally tools output too much information and it can be very time consuming to sift through. This section will discuss how to create a basic Frida script for Android using the <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Javascript API</a>. Other platforms may be slightly different, but the idea is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DIY Frida Script</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start writing your script, you must perform the following steps to ensure that you have all the necessary information.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the class and method name you are interested in.\n<ul>\n<li>This can be done by looking at the source code. If the source is not available, try running the app through a decompiler such as <a href=\"https://github.com/skylot/jadx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JADX-GUI</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Determine if this call is found in native code or not.\n<ul>\n<li>If the method is found in a shared object or dylib, then it is native.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Determine if the method has any overloads.\n<ul>\n<li>If there are overloads, take note of the type and total number of parameters that each overload accepts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-Native</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For this example, we will be inspecting the values that are passed into this login verification function:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1Vbcp0H2mFija2w0rkPiFXmelRo_QiDF8PZ8UkDguBoe60vL4dXs2b7udzCNddnnRC0DObAFmqer2JHI-7jtg1-MnWTNFL1HAZGLEugJX5Jp4GjOn4BhIwWx98TWZCpHFvCv9zsngrYNX6QfKlgbO2o\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we want to hook a Java method, we want to ensure that the JVM is loaded before we attempt to hook into the method’s functionality. This can be done by wrapping your hook in:<br><code>Java.perform(function(){})</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we need to assign a variable to the class that we want to hook:<br><code>const verifyLogin =&nbsp; Java.use(“com.insecureshop.util.Util”)</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, we need to hook into the implementation for the method (and overload) that we are interested in. Overload parameters are described by their corresponding Dalvik <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format#typedescriptor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TypeDescriptors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>Util[\"verifyUserNamePassword\"].overload(\"java.lang.String\", \"java.lang.String\").implementation = function (username, password){}</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we’ll overwrite the original functionality of the method. Remember that we must return the proper value from the custom implementation or the app may crash. A completed hook could look like this:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\nJava.perform(function(){\n  \tconst Util = Java.use(&quot;com.insecureshop.util.Util&quot;);\n \t Util&#91;&quot;verifyUserNamePassword&quot;].overload(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;, &quot;java.lang.String&quot;).implementation = function (username, password) {\n      \tconsole.log(`Util.verifyUserNamePassword is called: username=${username}, password=${password}`);\n     \t let result = this&#91;&quot;verifyUserNamePassword&quot;](username, password);\n      \tconsole.log(`Util.verifyUserNamePassword result=${result}`);\n      \treturn result;\n  \t};\n})\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Native</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Native code is hooked slightly differently than non-native code. Instead of generating a wrapper for the non-native class and overwriting the implementation, Interceptor is used to obtain the native method’s address in memory. In this example, we will be hooking the behavior of the C standard library <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">read</a> call. You can typically use official documentation to understand the parameters and return values of what you are hooking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we need to get the memory address of the method we want to hook. This can be done as follows:<br><code>Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'read');</code>Next, use Interceptor to attach to the memory address:<br><code>Interceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'read'),&nbsp;</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>{</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onEnter(args) {},</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onLeave(retval) {}</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br></code>Now, use the <code>onEnter</code> and <code>onLeave</code> callbacks to print out the values of the arguments. If we wanted to print out the contents that were read from each file, the hook could look like this:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">\nInterceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName(&#039;libc.so&#039;, &#039;read&#039;), {\n    onEnter(args) {\n      this.buffer = args&#91;1]\n    },\n    onLeave(retval) {\n      if (retval.toInt32() &gt; 0) {\n        console.log(`Read ${retval.toInt32()} byte(s)`);\n        const read = Memory.readByteArray(this.buffer, retval.toInt32());\n        console.log(read);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Notice how this is used to store the arguments to be used in the onLeave callback. This provides an easy way to pass values in between callbacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frida is a very capable debugging tool that should have a place in every developer’s toolkit.

The new Gartner report “Hype Cycle for Application Security, 2023” highlights the need to modernize application security programs with innovative technologies to help organizations develop secure code and guard against supply-chain risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle for Application Security notes, ‘Organizations are producing their own applications and are using faster and more agile methodologies to accomplish this. In doing so, they rely on developers to secure code, rather than security practitioners.” Gartner highlights <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-devsecops/\">DevSecOps</a>&nbsp;as a driver for security automation and names NowSecure as a sample <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing</a> vendor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gartner analysts recommend adopting <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/05/11/what-is-mobile-application-security/\">application security</a> technologies that enable developers to build apps in their preferred tools and workflows, quickly test them for security and privacy vulnerabilities, and easily remediate security bugs so they can meet release schedules. NowSecure offers the only comprehensive integrated suite of solutions to meet these needs, including <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">automated mobile application security testing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-academy-mobile-appsec-training/\">secure coding training</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-vetting/\">mobile app vetting for supply-chain risk management</a>, and mobile <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-mobile-app-penetration-testing-services/\">Pen Testing as a Service</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is the Gartner Hype Cycle?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gartner Hype Cycle is a graphical representation and research methodology from Gartner for tracking the adoption and maturity of emerging technologies and their potential impact on industries. The Hype Cycle provides a framework for understanding the lifecycle of technology trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies use this important research to assess trends, manage risk, inform strategic planning, innovate, understand market dynamics, make investment decisions, educate stakeholders and track technical evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gartner Hype Cycle estimates the expected timeline for technology categories to mature from nascent stages through mainstream adoption. The phases include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Innovation Trigger: Occurs when an event, technological breakthrough or product launch generates buzz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Peak of Inflated Expectations: Product usage increases though there’s still more hype than proof that the innovation can deliver</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trough of Disillusionment: Original excitement wears off and early adopters encounter challenges</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slope of Enlightenment: Early adopters realize initial benefits and others start to understand how to adapt the innovation to their organizations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plateau of Productivity: More users realize real-world benefits and the featured technology becomes mainstream.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to categorizing maturity levels of each highlighted technology, the Gartner Hype Cycle further classifies technologies by rating the benefits on a scale from low to high.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Technologies with low benefits slightly improve processes that will be difficult to translate into increased revenue or cost savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technologies with moderate benefits provide incremental improvements to established processes that will increase revenue or cost savings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technologies with high benefits ratings enable new ways of performing horizontal or vertical processes that will increase revenue or cost savings.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transformational technologies enable new ways of doing business across industries that will dramatically shift industry dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Security Modernization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gartner writes that DevSecOps enables security teams to keep pace with development and operations teams in modern application development. DevSecOps has reached maturity and drives the need for application security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among applications, today more than 80% of all digital time online is spent in mobile apps vs the web, generating more than $260 billion in mobile revenue in 2022. Not surprisingly, organizations need robust <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing (MAST) solutions</a> to find and fix security and privacy vulnerabilities before releasing mobile apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gartner proclaims that mobile app security testing has entered the Hype Cycle Slope of Enlightenment phase where “commercial off-the-shelf methodologies and tools ease the development process” and is approaching the Plateau of Productivity in which “real-world benefits of an innovation are demonstrated and accepted and tools and methodologies are increasingly stable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market penetration for mobile AppSec testing has reached 20% to 50% of the target audience, reports Gartner. “Even though every organization that delivers mobile applications should perform security testing, regulated and other high-security industries such as <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-industry/financial-services/\">financial services</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/healthcare-industry/\">healthcare</a> and online <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-industry/retail-and-hospitality/\">retail</a>, have a higher urgency to adopt mobile AST,” Gartner notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Many organizations have less advanced application security programs and are not yet testing mobile app code,” cites Gartner. That means businesses leave their mobile apps exposed to security and privacy vulnerabilities that put company and customer data at risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, NowSecure benchmark testing of millions of mobile apps in the App Store and Google Play reveals that <a href=\"https://mobilerisktracker.nowsecure.com/\">85% contain security and privacy issues</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/mobile-app-breach-news/\">Breaches</a> and data leaks jeopardize revenue, damage customer trust and subject organizations to regulatory fines and penalties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/web-vs-mobile-app-security-testing-tools?x=9z-j5n\">Web and mobile attack surfaces and architecture</a> differ significantly, making legacy web application security testing tools insufficient for assessing mobile apps. Gartner recommends deploying robust mobile application security automation that can identify client-side code vulnerabilities and includes static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST) and <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-vetting/\">third-party risk assessment</a> capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure Platform runs a battery of 600 tests using SAST, DAST, IAST and API security testing for the deepest and broadest risk coverage in the industry, accurately identifying security, privacy, supply chain and app store blocker issues. NowSecure Platform integrates in the DevSecOps pipeline and speeds resolution through developer-friendly issue details such as business impact, evidence, embedded remediation instructions, code samples, vulnerable code locations, links to Apple and Android developer documentation, and just-in-time training videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gartner advises organizations that need a specialized, lightweight or speedy mobile AST solution to look for dedicated mobile offerings. Gartner also recommends using the <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/manager-guide-owasp?x=9z-j5n#page=1\">OWASP Mobile Application Security</a> Verification Standards (MASVS) as a practical reference for evaluating testing solution’s technical capabilities and coverage. NowSecure Platform automated testing and pen testing assessments <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/owasp-mobile-appsec-testing/\">map to the OWASP MASVS</a> to help aid compliance with the leading industry standard for mobile application security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mobile AppSec Software &amp; Services Uses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to using mobile AppSec testing solutions to assess the apps organizations build themselves, the Hype Cycle report notes that enterprises use them for <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-vetting/\">application vetting</a> to determine which ones are safe to use. Many NowSecure customers tap NowSecure Platform to evaluate third-party apps in the public app stores before deploying them in their organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gartner report emphasizes the value of <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/08/24/4-things-you-can-do-with-a-mobile-sbom/\">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</a> to evaluate software development kits, open-source software components and other third-party code to guard against <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/global-software-supply-chain-trend-report?x=ZuFWdb\">supply-chain attacks</a>. This is particularly important because Gartner estimates that 40% to 80% of code in new software projects comes from third parties such as runtime, libraries, components and SDKs. NowSecure Platform generates a dynamic SBOM with each assessment to help inform developers what third-party libraries they have in their applications. The expert <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-penetration-testing/\">NowSecure penetration testing</a> team also offers <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/press-releases/nowsecure-announces-new-mobile-sdk-pen-testing-service-to-protect-the-mobile-supply-chain/\">SDK pen testing as a service</a> to help developers understand the security risks in the SDKs they use or provide to customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the Hype Cycle report, Gartner tracks the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and rates it as a transformational technology. However, it also documents potential <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/08/23/key-security-considerations-for-ai-coding-assistants-in-mobile-devsecops/\">security risks of using AI coding assistants</a> such as GitHub Copilot or Tabnine and emphasizes the need to thoroughly test for security and code quality issues when using AI assistants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Hype Cycle for Application Security highlights secure coding training as another emerging technology. “75% of software engineering leaders surveyed in the 2022 Gartner Software Engineering Leaders Role Survey stated that application security skills are a pain point in their organization,” states the report. Secure coding training raises awareness about the impact of vulnerabilities and upskills developers by teaching them how to build secure mobile apps. <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a> offers developer remediation assistance and just-in-time training videos while <a href=\"https://academy.nowsecure.com/\">NowSecure Academy </a>offers a wealth of free training and educational videos on secure coding practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Gartner Hype Cycle highlights Pen Testing as a Service (PTaaS) as an innovative technology poised to plateau in five to 10 years. Delivered via a SaaS model, PTaaS combines automation and manual pen testing to increase efficiency and effectiveness. “PTaaS complements vulnerability scanning and application security testing and provides cost-optimization and quality improvement of pen testing output and validation of vulnerability status,” the researchers state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gartner advises clients to <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/key-criteria-choosing-mobile-app-pen-testing-vendor?x=cEXJzu#page=1\">seek a PTaaS provider</a> that combines human analysis and automation, aligns with relevant compliance requirements and provides customized guidance throughout the engagement to alleviate the security skills gap.<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-mobile-app-penetration-testing-services/\"> NowSecure Mobile PTaaS </a>combines continuous automated security testing and expert pen testing to deliver the frequency, depth and coverage taking a consultative approach to meeting customer needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/?\">Request a demo</a> of NowSecure Platform to see why Gartner cited it in the Application Security Hype Cycle and how it solves the DevSecOps and security challenges outlined in the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Report Disclaimer: Gartner, Hype Cycle for Application Security, 2023, Dionisio Zumerle, 24 July 2023.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and HYPE CYCLE is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates.

Many organizations have already embraced AI-powered coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to improve the developer experience and speed time to market. A recent <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai\">McKinsey study</a> found devs can complete coding tasks up to twice as fast with generative AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI coding assistants automate repetitive tasks to help devs code faster. But while innovative AI supercharge productivity, the tools have one notable pitfall: they can increase security risk. AI coding assistants aren’t foolproof so organizations should adopt this disruptive technology carefully. Following secure coding best practices and conducting automated <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing</a> to find and fix security bugs prior to release remains critically important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI code generators offer autocomplete suggestions and speed development by automating repetitive tasks and writing boilerplate code. However, the tools aren’t 100% accurate and can <a href=\"https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/your-ai-coding-assistant-is-a-hot-mess\">make mistakes</a>. They can introduce <a href=\"https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/your-ai-coding-assistant-is-a-hot-mess\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">security or privacy vulnerabilities</a> or threat actors can exploit the tools to <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/chatgpt-hallucinations-developers-supply-chain-malware-attacks?_mc=NL_DR_EDT_DR_daily_20230606&amp;cid=NL_DR_EDT_DR_daily_20230606&amp;sp_aid=116782&amp;elq_cid=35754884&amp;sp_eh=4cbf8d3a2fc1a30e7226f1fbe2460148c03a3411767bf01e0bfabc2096302ee2&amp;sp_eh=4cbf8d3a2fc1a30e7226f1fbe2460148c03a3411767bf01e0bfabc2096302ee2&amp;utm_source=eloqua&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=DR_NL_Dark%20Reading%20Daily_06.06.23&amp;sp_cid=48779&amp;utm_content=DR_NL_Dark%20Reading%20Daily_06.06.23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create and spread malware</a> or launch supply-chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, a recent Stanford University <a href=\"https://ee.stanford.edu/dan-boneh-and-team-find-relying-ai-more-likely-make-your-code-buggier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research study</a> found software engineers who used code-generating AI tools wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Worse, participants who relied on the AI coding assistant were lulled into a false sense of security and were more likely to believe that they wrote secure code. For these reasons, developers and security teams must exercise caution when using generative AI tools and factor in a few key security considerations. Never assume that AI coding tools write accurate and secure code and always test any code written by humans or AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are AI Coding Assistants?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI coding assistants tap AI and machine learning to help developers write, review and improve their code. They perform such tasks as completing lines of code, writing code from scratch based on natural language prompts or translating code from one programming language to another. Organizations have experimented with applying generative AI to these aspects of software development:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Code completion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Error detection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Code refactoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Documentation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Code reviews</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Code search</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Language support</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some embed directly into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) so developers can receive code snippet suggestions or snippets within their preferred code editor rather than copying and pasting, further boosting productivity. For enterprise mobile app development, organizations should seek an <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3694900/ai-coding-assistants-8-features-enterprises-should-seek.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI coding assistant </a>that’s trainable on your code base, offers contextual suggestions and can be customized to the way a dev team works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular generative AI tools used for software development include <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT</a>, an AI chatbot created by OpenAI, and <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub Copilot</a>, which is powered by the OpenAI Codex large language model and has been trained on billions of lines of code. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon CodeWhisperer</a>, Baidu Comate, <a href=\"https://codeium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Codeium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tabnine</a>. In addition, <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub Copilot Chat</a> lets developers ask and receive answers to coding-related questions directly within a supported IDE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, pairing generative AI tools with a programmer generally creates a happier, more productive dev experience. The tools streamline software development and help companies ship mobile apps faster. But regardless of the AI coding assistant chosen, dev teams must factor in a few considerations to use them carefully and securely. Being aware of the limitations enables mobile app security and DevSecOps teams gain efficiencies while properly managing risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most developers I’ve spoken with are excited to incorporate AI into their set of tools,” says NowSecure Co-Founder Andrew Hoog, who recently built a simple news reader with GitHub Copilot and it would have taken 10x longer without that help. “But all code, whether written directly by developers or assistance, can include security and privacy issues. I believe that automated security testing incorporated directly into the developer experience is perhaps even more important today.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Coding Assistants Create Risks to Data Privacy &amp; IP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Devs and security professionals need to understand how AI coding assistants work and what powers them. The tool algorithms rely on large volumes of data to learn, find patterns and make decisions. They require access to existing codebases which could expose sensitive data. <a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2023/05/11/these-companies-have-banned-chatgpt-in-the-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Samsung</a> banned AI workplace chatbots after discovering its source code was accidentally leaked to ChatGPT. Apple, Amazon, Northrop Grumman and Verizon also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2023/05/11/these-companies-have-banned-chatgpt-in-the-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">restrict employee use of ChatGPT</a> to prevent the release of confidential information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a first step to adoption, organizations should have visibility into what data is being collected and how it’s being used, stored and transmitted in order to prevent exposure to unauthorized third parties. At a minimum, they must take the standard precautions to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Additional protective measures may also be prudent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers must also be careful about the open-source code used. The tools may suggest the use of external third-party libraries that create <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-vetting/\">supply-chain security risk</a> through dependencies. In addition, AI coding assistants may not have access to the latest frameworks or libraries so may suggest outdated coding. Companies need to understand or stipulate which libraries the tools use and if they can be trusted and be mindful of potential legal issues stemming from <a href=\"https://www.itprotoday.com/development-techniques-and-management/what-ai-assisted-coding-and-should-you-use-it#close-modal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plagiarism</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tAutomated security testing incorporated directly into the developer experience is perhaps even more important today.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n        <cite>&#8211; NowSecure Co-Founder Andrew Hoog</cite>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Coding Tools Can Create Security Bugs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations should be aware that AI coding assistants have flaws like humans do. The tools can mislead inexperienced developers and make them overconfident. As mentioned above, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/28/code-generating-ai-can-introduce-security-vulnerabilities-study-finds/?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stanford study of Codex</a> found study participants who used it were more likely to write incorrect and insecure code compared to the control group. Worse they were more likely to say their insecure answers were secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those findings track with an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">earlier study of GitHub Copilot</a> conducted in 2021 by researchers affiliated with the New York University. The NYU researchers produced 89 different scenarios in which Copilot had to finish incomplete code. Of the 1,692 programs it generated, approximately <a href=\"https://cyber.nyu.edu/2021/10/15/ccs-researchers-find-github-copilot-generates-vulnerable-code-40-of-the-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">40% had security vulnerabilities</a> or flaws that could be exploited by an attacker. The authors of the study recommend pairing AI coding assistants with appropriate security-aware tooling during both training and generation to minimize the risk of introducing security bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Coding Assistants Lack Contextual Awareness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to AI coding assistants’ reliance on existing data and codebases to look for patterns, they don’t truly understand the broader context of the project, business requirements and design principles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI coding assistants struggle with generating code for handling unusual use cases that don’t fit within the context of what they have learned from or complex debugging scenarios that require deeper understanding and problem solving. Another challenge is the code may work but not fit with the overall goals for the project, its architecture or long-term maintainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To overcome these obstacles, use generative AI tools for inspiration but carefully check the work. Over time, developers can learn to craft better prompts to aid contextual understanding.</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_5d32ff039343f7d9dd9fc7201c2d5c4d\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"featured-image-holder js-featured-image-holder\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle='background-image: url(\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-5-730x400.png\")'\n\t\t\t\t></div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-github-actions/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNowSecure GitHub Actions\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"resource-subtitle\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNowSecure and GitHub have partnered to seamlessly integrate mobile app security testing into GitHub Workflows.\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-right justify-content-end\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-github-actions/' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Read More</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use AI Coding Assistants with Caution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The security considerations outlined above underscore that organizations should perform extra monitoring and automated mobile application security testing as usual. Solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a> <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/effortless-integrations-platform-drives-developer-first-mobile-devsecops?x=LIaYZt\">integrate</a> directly into the dev pipeline for fast, efficient testing and embedded development resources. For example, developers using GitHub can leverage GitHub Copilot to write mobile app code and <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/nowsecure-github-actions/\">NowSecure Platform</a> to automatically test that code, all from inside GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another best practice is to follow the security standards that are critical to success. Developers should rely on the OWASP <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS</a>) for web apps and OWASP <a href=\"https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)</a> for mobile apps. Leverage <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NowSecure Platform</a> to test mobile apps against OWASP MASVS requirements and achieve compliance. In addition, the new <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OWASP Large Language Model Top 10 </a>project helps organizations understand and guard against the risks of LMM applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers should use their own judgment and understanding of building apps when incorporating suggestions from generative AI tools into their code. Follow standards like OWASP for <a href=\"https://academy.nowsecure.com/\">secure coding</a> and test all code to ensure it meets the security bar. Using AI coding assistants can undoubtedly be effective in helping developers release mobile apps quickly and efficiently as long as they are well informed, exercise critical thinking and use the tools wisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see an AI coding assistant in action, watch the NowSecure Tech Talk “<a href=\"https://info.nowsecure.com/2023-TechTalk-Webinar-Series.html\">How to Build a Simple Mobile App with GitHub Copilot</a>.” Hoog and Solutions Engineer Kevin Lewis share their observations about what the AI tools can do well and where they come up short.

In reality, organizations need a range of security tools and techniques to safeguard their apps. While many use Static Application Security Testing and pen testing to secure their web and mobile apps, they leave themselves at significant risk without automated continuous dynamic test coverage of their mobile apps that can be fast, <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/6-ways-secure-mobile-app-development-efficiency?x=LIaYZt\">efficient</a> and <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/cut-costs?x=9z-j5n\">economical</a>. This blog post will cover application security testing types, DAST from a web and mobile perspective and delve into pipeline automation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tGiven the high frequency rate of vulnerabilities in mobile apps, it becomes clear that every organization should be using DAST.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AppSec Testing Techniques</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AppSec teams have learned it takes a village of multiple tools and techniques to ensure full security coverage of the apps their devs build. Traditionally teams use a mix of static, dynamic, interactive, and <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-penetration-testing/\">pen testing</a> along with software composition analysis, each optimized for a different part of the problem set. Let’s run through the common suite of security tools, often purchased from multiple vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</strong>: Static analyzes the source code to identify vulnerable code such as SQL injection attacks, buffer overflows, improper input validation, etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</strong>: Dynamic analysis of the running app binary in execution uses various attack scenarios to identify issues such as bad authentication, unencrypted network transmission, insecure storage, SQL injection, etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)</strong>: Interactive analysis injects instrumentation code inside the application to collect security telemetry and identify vulnerabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Software Composition Analysis (SCA):</strong> SCA examines third-party libraries and open-source code for known vulnerabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pen Testing or </strong><a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-mobile-app-penetration-testing-services/\"><strong>Pen Testing as a Service (PTaaS</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: Expert pen testers perform threat modeling and manual dynamic testing using attack scenarios on an application to identify vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When we look at <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/web-vs-mobile-app-security-testing-tools?x=9z-j5n\">app security testing for web vs. mobile</a> platforms, the underlying technology and tools differ. Whereas web AppDev and AppSec teams may deploy multiple disparate tools from different vendors to run in different phases of the pipeline process, current state-of-the-art <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">mobile application security testing </a>tools like <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a> combine SAST, DAST, and IAST in a single tool that runs on the mobile app binary. We will dig into these advantages later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Speed &amp; Results of AppSec Testing Techniques</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DevSecOps enables iterative application development in smaller chunks and accelerated release cycles. The goal is to automate as much security testing as possible and empower devs to do their own security testing as they write code. Like automating QA, the objective is to provide fast feedback loops to speed remediation and release cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s go back and look at the mixed bag of speed, efficiency and accuracy of SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA and pen testing techniques as we try to incorporate security test automation into the mobile dev pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DAST_Blog_Chart-1.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12785\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DAST_Blog_Chart-1.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Accelerating Security Testing in DevSecOps Pipelines</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To meet speed and scale requirements, today’s pipelines often use SAST scans on repos and SCA scans on pull requests, such as with security embedded in <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub Advanced Security</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nowsecure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub Actions</a> or security tools integrated with CI/CD pipelines such as Azure DevOps, GitLab, Jenkins or Jira. These are configured to run fast in minutes in order to meet the rapid development and release cycles that businesses often demand. Sometimes periodic pen testing is also performed prior to release but not within the pipeline automation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where does this leave DAST for <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-devsecops/\">mobile DevSecOps</a>? For many organizations, dynamic application security testing is only performed manually and periodically. A few traditional web-based DAST tools exist, but organizations find them difficult to configure and run. From a performance perspective, web DAST usually requires hours or days to complete. But that’s way too slow for modern fast-moving pipelines that seek security test completion and feedback in minutes. As a result, dev teams often go without frequent dynamic testing, leaving each release at risk with voids in testing coverage. To make up for it, they might manually pen test once or twice a year, but that leaves significant gaps and <a href=\"https://mobilerisktracker.nowsecure.com/\">security risks</a>. Vulnerabilities found in production can lead to <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/mobile-app-breach-news/\">data breaches</a> that damage the business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile AST is different. Automating SAST/DAST/IAST/SCA via an all-in-one approach delivers fast testing results in minutes to keep pace with modern <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-devsecops/\">mobile DevSecOps</a> pipelines. How can mobile DAST run fast? It starts with the binary testing approach used by <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a>. An automation engine drives mobile app security testing on real devices in minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>First, NowSecure performs binary SAST analysis, collecting key vulnerability data. Then NowSecure injects IAST test code into the binary, loads the binary onto a real device, and runs DAST analysis. <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2020/02/19/nowsecure-introduces-the-worlds-first-mobile-iast-solution/\">DAST</a> provides “outside in” analysis, while IAST provides “inside out” analysis simultaneously. Depending on the size and complexity of the binary, the combined testing runs in less than 20 minutes in the pipeline, enabling continuous testing of every build every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uniquely combining SAST/DAST/IAST in a single stack overcomes traditional web DAST challenges. For example, NowSecure findings pinpoint code locations, provide detailed evidence for each finding and boast very high accuracy rates with less than 1% false positives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help developers speed security bug fixes, NowSecure includes embedded remediation guides with description, business impact, evidence, remediation instructions, links to iOS and Android developer docs and <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/owasp-mobile-appsec-testing/\">OWASP resources</a>, code samples and regulatory mappings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For screaming fast pipelines, NowSecure Platform <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/effortless-integrations-platform-drives-developer-first-mobile-devsecops?x=LIaYZt\">integrates with all major DevOps tools</a> to run fully autonomously including GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins. Jira, Azure DevOps, and more. Organizations can automatically test every build every day and route prioritized, effective tickets to devs for efficient remediation. NowSecure Platform also supports <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/07/26/secure-mobile-app-development-embracing-policy-driven-devsecops/\">policy-driven development</a> to optimize pipeline performance and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for further dynamic coverage in mobile DevSecOps pipelines, <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/guided-testing/\">NowSecure Platform Guided Testing</a> offers daily automated testing complemented by a periodic manual review by a NowSecure mobile security expert who will drive the mobile app with specific multi-factor authentication and navigation based on threat modeling and testing needs. This unifies the speed of DevOps and the depth of dynamic analysis.</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_4492a55320891841ed3e569cc8164788\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://info.nowsecure.com/on-demand-continuous-mobile-appsec-testing.html\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNowSecure Platform Demo\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-right justify-content-end\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://info.nowsecure.com/on-demand-continuous-mobile-appsec-testing.html' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Read More</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>SAST vs DAST Coverage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think that since SAST is easier, just stick with that — get the speed you need and attempt to tune for the noisy false positives. You can try to run without automated DAST in your mobile pipelines — it can&#8217;t be that bad to leave some code uncovered by continuous testing in the pipeline, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://mobilerisktracker.nowsecure.com/\">live benchmark analysis</a> of thousands of mobile apps in the public app stores shows that 85% or more of mobile apps are vulnerable and over 70% leak private data. When we dig into the vulnerability patterns, we find that the majority of vulnerabilities in these public apps are found via DAST, not SAST. DAST uncovers issues like insecure storage, insecure network data transmission, data leakage into log files, improper use of crypto, lack of anti tampering, to name a few that SAST typically does not find. What’s more, nearly all the vulnerabilities that are CVSS-scored critical and high can only be found accurately via DAST — SAST misses them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the high frequency rate of vulnerabilities in mobile apps — and high CVSS risk scores of these vulnerabilities -— it becomes clear that every organization should be using DAST. And with modern mobile AppSec tools like NowSecure, you can include automated DAST in your mobile DevSecOps pipelines at the speed and scale you need with low cost and high efficiency.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/08/09/how-to-use-dast-in-a-mobile-devsecops-pipeline/\">How to Use DAST in a Mobile DevSecOps Pipeline</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com\">NowSecure</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Secure Mobile App Development: Embracing Policy-Driven DevSecOps","link":"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2023/07/26/secure-mobile-app-development-embracing-policy-driven-devsecops/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Ola Alibaloye"},"pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:30:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Best Practices"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security Solutions"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.nowsecure.com/?p=21586"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Many organizations have embraced mobile DevSecOps by integrating automated mobile application security throughout the software development lifecycle.

The release policy provides a minimum bar for dev to get an app into production. Automating the release policy gives the security team more time to go deeper and investigate the other findings that require more review. Once operationalized through software automation, this approach speeds up development, testing and release processes, while removing friction, debate and uncertainty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often hear from developers:&nbsp; “Just tell us the rules and we will follow them.” Another thing that we hear from developers is: “Don’t waste our time with false positives and things that aren’t critical.” Security and development teams can build a standard set of rules (policies) for which findings in their mobile app must be remediated before the app is pushed to production. Doing so drives consistency and uniformity in security and privacy practices across teams, projects, apps or risk profiles. What’s more, it enables development teams to move faster by knowing where the boundaries are for what issues must be fixed immediately and what issues are acceptable risks. The automated release policy with auditable test data also provides the evidence necessary to attest that proper controls are in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Operationalizing Through Policy Automation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a standard policy for teams to follow is the first key component of policy-based DevSecOps. The second is operationalizing it. Once teams have the set of requirements relevant to their mobile app, they need <a href=\"https://academy.nowsecure.com/\">training</a> on the security and privacy policy and practices. Then they need a way to integrate that policy check into their mobile AppSec testing process.&nbsp;<br>Ideally, businesses have fully automated mobile AppSec testing <a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/effortless-integrations-platform-drives-developer-first-mobile-devsecops?x=LIaYZt\">integrated into the CI/CD pipeline</a>. In this seamless process, devs build the mobile app in their CI tool which kicks off a security assessment. Once the tests complete, only the issues that violate the set policy are automatically routed to the development team in the form of tickets on their board. Developers know that these are prioritized, valid “must fix” tickets based on the previously agreed policy in place. In the end, both the development and security teams know that when the policy-driven test results are all green, that is a good thing and they can automatically promote to production.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote\n        class=\"custom-quote  \">\n\n    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left\"></i>\n\tDevelopers and security teams can use NowSecure Platform Policy Engine to create custom policies that include relevant risk profiles, customize risk scores, categorize issues into groups and prioritize issues for remediation.    <i class=\"fas fa-quote-right\"></i>\n\n\t\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Policy-Based DevSecOps Best Practices</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations looking to move into policy-based DevSecOps should consider these best practices:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foster Collaboration</strong>: DevSecOps is all about breaking down the silos between development and security teams. Encourage collaboration between these teams to jointly define and refine policies. Create regular communication, knowledge sharing and mutual understanding of mobile security requirements. Agree in advance on what is a Release Blocker vs Backlog vs Acceptable Risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create Comprehensive, Tiered Policies</strong>: Create policies that cover the relevant requirements for your mobile app that include business, security and privacy requirements as well as industry standards and compliance requirements. For organizations with many mobile apps where some apps may require more security scrutiny than others, it may be appropriate to create multiple tiered policies based on risk profiles.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review and Update Policy Regularly</strong>: Review policies periodically to align them with new tests/findings from NowSecure, emerging threats, compliance regulations and lessons learned from security incidents. Update policies accordingly and communicate changes internally to the relevant teams.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrate Security Testing</strong>: Embed policy-driven security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to help identify security and privacy issues earlier in the development process, where they are easiest and most cost effective to remediate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Using NowSecure Policy Engine for Policy-Based DevSecOps</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure introduced the <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/09/26/nowsecure-platform-pumpsup-devsecops/\">NowSecure Platform Policy Engine</a> to enable organizations to seamlessly deploy, automate and enforce standard and custom policies and controls. The use of industry-standard testing, such as OWASP MASVS, demonstrates that NowSecure has the highest quality testing capabilities and makes it easy to provide proof of controls for regulatory and cyber risk compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security and development teams can use NowSecure Platform Policy Engine to create custom policies that include relevant risk profiles, customize risk scores, categorize issues into groups and prioritize issues for remediation. With a release policy in place, NowSecure automatically tests every mobile app build and then creates and routes tickets to developers to remediate based on the previously agreed-upon release criteria. This capability enables NowSecure to provide the most efficient path to scale policy-driven mobile DevSecOps in a few simple steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure automation integrates with many popular dev tools such Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins and Jira. For this example, I’ve integrated NowSecure Platform with Jira boards to perform <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-security-testing/\">automated mobile AppSec testing</a> after every build and automated ticket routing. Follow along to learn how to use the <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a> Policy Engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>1. Create a new integration between NowSecure and Jira. You must be an administrator of both the NowSecure Platform and Jira instance to create a new App Link in your Jira instance. You can find a full guide to creating this integration in the <a href=\"https://support.nowsecure.com/hc/en-us/articles/9481304633101-Jira-Platform-Integration-Guide\"><a href=\"https://support.nowsecure.com/hc/en-us/articles/9481304633101-Jira-Platform-Integration-Guide\">NowSecure Help Center</a>.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"405\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine1.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21587\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine1.png 405w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine1-360x350.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>2. The second thing the administrator needs to do is create a custom policy. As described, development and security teams collaborate on this mobile app release policy. The policy will be made up of three categories and you can fully customize which findings are included and excluded from your reports. For this example, I have created the following categories: Development Fix, Security Review and Backlog.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2-960x488.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21588\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2-960x488.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2-360x183.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2-768x390.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2-1536x780.png 1536w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine2.png 1919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>3. Once the policy categories have been created, your teams will have to decide which findings to include in each category. This is where <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/09/07/how-to-build-a-mobile-application-security-champion-program/\">development and security alignment</a> is critical because it should include all relevant industry standards and compliance requirements. The <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-platform/\">NowSecure Platform</a> Policy Engine makes this easy — all findings are tied to regulatory requirements and filterable. Here, you can also customize the severity of each finding individually, including setting the CVSS score.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3-960x486.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21589\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3-960x486.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3-360x182.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3-768x389.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3-1536x778.png 1536w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4-960x489.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21590\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4-960x489.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4-360x183.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4-768x391.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4-1536x783.png 1536w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine4.png 1919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>4. Finally, you can link the app to the correct board and decide which policy categories create tickets. Notice in this example, the “Development Fix” category is the only category that generates tickets. The intention here is to improve developer productivity by sending them only the items that absolutely require their attention (release blockers), while the security team can review the other findings from mobile application security tests in the NowSecure Platform interface.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5-960x407.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21591\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5-960x407.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5-360x153.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5-768x326.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5-1536x652.png 1536w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine5.png 1918w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For developers using the board, issue tickets will automatically be created through the integration with the information that you decide is most relevant from the issue found in security testing. You can choose to include the Finding title, description, steps to reproduce, remediation resources, and business impact. Here’s an example of a ticket generated by NowSecure Platform:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine6-960x642.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21592\" width=\"962\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine6-960x642.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine6-360x241.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine6-768x514.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine6.png 1283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You can still view the results of the assessment in the App Analysis section of NowSecure Platform.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7-960x488.png\" alt=\"Policy Engine\" class=\"wp-image-21593\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7-960x488.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7-360x183.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7-768x390.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7-1536x780.png 1536w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PolicyEngine7.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Here, the 12 “Development Fix” findings automatically created tickets which are linked (with the status shown) in the top right of each finding. You can see that this assessment also surfaced 12 “Security Review” findings, which the security team can review along with the informational findings, artifacts, and insights like the generated <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/08/24/4-things-you-can-do-with-a-mobile-sbom/\">Software Bill of Materials</a> (SBOM).</p>\n\n\n<section id=\"featured-resource-block_f9aa0966b9a00966d8879c5400ab9a82\" class=\"featured-resource color- bg- mt-none mb-none\"\n\t>\n\t<div class=\"bol-container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"featured-resource-content js-set-min-height d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content-holder\">\n\t\t\t\t<!-- I took the following snippet out for now, I do not believe that it is supposed to be here, Jacob -->\n\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"card-title text-bold color-\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://info.nowsecure.com/on-demand-continuous-mobile-appsec-testing.html\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNowSecure Platform Demo\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n    <div class=\"cta-holder d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-md-center align-items-right justify-content-end\">\n\t\t                <div class=\"mt-sm d-flex 0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href='https://info.nowsecure.com/on-demand-continuous-mobile-appsec-testing.html' target='_self' class='bol-btn-primary'>Read More</a>                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How NowSecure Customers Use Policy Engine Today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many NowSecure customers successfully use <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/press-releases/nowsecure-platform-update-delivers-groundbreaking-productivity-performance-coverage-and-cost-savings-for-mobile-application-security/\">NowSecure Platform Policy Engine</a> to customize their results from NowSecure Platform. On average, users create more than two policies, but we’ve seen some customers create as many as nine.

The DOJ proactively manages its mobile app portfolio by vetting mobile apps from the public app stores prior to installation to determine if they’re safe to use. In addition to performing <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-app-vetting/\">mobile app vetting for supply-chain risks</a>, the agency continuously monitors mobile apps to act on changes that introduce security or privacy vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NowSecure Platform provides the following benefits:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gain visibility into the security and privacy risks of Android and iOS mobile apps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continuously monitor its mobile app portfolio for new supply-chain risks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enforce policy and comply with an array of federal mandates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Manually assessing each and every mobile app that DOJ staff ask to use simply isn’t possible without automation. However, NowSecure Platform enables the <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-industry/government/\">federal public-sector agency </a>to vet mobile apps in as few as 30 minutes. In addition, the NowSecure Workstation <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/products/nowsecure-workstation/\">pen testing toolkit</a> aids staff in testing complex mobile apps. “It’s a huge workload lifted from my security team,” says Mike McHugh, mobile security program manager for the DOJ.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/justice-dept-case-study?x=9z-j5n\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-DOJ-960x337.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21541\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-DOJ-960x337.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-DOJ-360x126.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-DOJ-768x269.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-DOJ.png 1001w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The DOJ built a Mobile Risk Dashboard that enables McHugh’s team to track mobile app and mobile device risk and control mobile app usage on government devices. The Mobile Risk Dashboard runs NowSecure Platform for automated mobile application security testing, VMware AirWatch enterprise mobility management software and Splunk for analytical insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The level of customer support is a huge differentiator for NowSecure and the product is great,” says McHugh.

The ADA launched the <a href=\"https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mobile Application Security Assessment</a> (MASA) program to enable developers to obtain third-party validation that their mobile apps meet industry<a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/solutions/by-need/mobile-standards-compliance/\"> standards</a> for security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies may submit their Android apps to an ADA Authorized Lab for a rigorous <a href=\"https://appdefensealliance.dev/directory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ADA MASA independent security review</a>. Apps that meet the requirements are listed on the <a href=\"https://appdefensealliance.dev/directory\">App Validation Directory</a> and display an independent security review badge in their Google Play Store listings, giving users confidence that mobile apps have been vetted by outside experts to be safe and secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HYPR makes a passwordless multi-factor authentication solution and its entire business revolves around security. “From a mobile app security standpoint, making sure that we keep data secure is our main concern,” says Aldo Salas, application security lead for HYPR.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://discover.nowsecure.com/success-stories/HYPR-case-study\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-HYPR-960x337.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21540\" srcset=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-HYPR-960x337.png 960w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-HYPR-360x126.png 360w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-HYPR-768x269.png 768w, https://www.nowsecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/case-study-recap-blog-HYPR.png 1001w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/high-tech-apps-infographic?x=9z-j5n#page=1\">high-tech company</a> invested in MASA certification to gain an advantage over its competitors. “ADA MASA validations are important because they give customers peace of mind,” Salas says. “For me, this is a big differentiator…customers can publicly see that this application doesn’t have any major security issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After conducting an <a href=\"https://www.nowsecure.com/resources/nowsecure-ms/ada-masa-checklist?x=LIaYZt\">ADA Authorized Labs evaluation</a>, Salas selected NowSecure to perform&nbsp; ADA MASA validation because it’s the sole mobile-first, mobile-only member and to gain access to NowSecure Platform automated mobile application security testing software.
