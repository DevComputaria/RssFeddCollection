The relationship is currently very bad, and to think otherwise is naive.</p>\n<p>Paul Heer, a former US national intelligence officer for East Asia, described the outcome of this meeting perfectly in <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/joe-biden-xi-jinping-summit-nothing-accomplished-207317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a recent piece for the National Interest.</a> Essentially, and this is obvious by reading each side's readout of the meeting, the US has rejected Xi&rsquo;s very generous offer to <em>&ldquo;enhance solidarity and cooperation and join hands to meet global challenges and promote global security and prosperity&rdquo;</em> (a quote from the Chinese readout) by <em>&ldquo;emphasizing first and foremost that &lsquo;the United States and China are in competition.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>In focusing on division over unity, Biden attempted to <em>&ldquo;speak primarily to his domestic political audience &ndash; especially his critics on Capitol Hill &ndash; demonstrating his readiness to be tough on China.&rdquo;</em> On the other hand, Xi&rsquo;s moves in San Fransisco <em>&ldquo;appeared to be directed primarily at the global audience, for whom he sought to demonstrate Beijing&rsquo;s readiness to be reasonable and cooperative in dealing with Washington&rsquo;s more confrontational approach.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/6554c6ea2030277f322c9038.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587328-china-biden-real-problems/\">Beijing responds to Biden’s ‘problems’ claim</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Heer is of the very well-informed opinion that Xi <em>&ldquo;reiterated Beijing&rsquo;s longstanding objection to framing the US-China relationship as primarily competitive, asserting that this would not solve the problems facing the two countries and the world.&rdquo;</em> Thus, he concludes, <em>&ldquo;the core underlying sources of tension and mistrust were not addressed, and the fundamental political, structural, and historical obstacles to rapprochement remain intact.... Progress will be halting as long as both sides are unwilling or not prepared to assume the risks and responsibilities of reciprocal accommodation.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Indeed, I agree with most of this &ndash; but it&rsquo;s clear that the US has had now almost two full presidential terms with a totally incompetent head of state, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both of these men have no idea what they&rsquo;re doing and are extraordinarily dangerous for the US&rsquo; national interests in foreign diplomacy. And everyone can see this. But it&rsquo;s not just about personality politics; rather, this lack of rigor and talent is emblematic of the general, overall decline of the US as a major world power.</p>\n<p>The US, in reality, is not a place with stable institutions or, at this juncture, the strong diplomatic or military capabilities that it once possessed. The fact that the US and its allies continue to lose proxy wars against Russia (ex: Syria and Ukraine) is one such clear example, and so is the success of China&rsquo;s diplomacy in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the US is essentially a perhaps once-great nation, with a ton of residual influence and wealth, that is being sapped by a ruthlessly self-interested oligarchy. It&rsquo;s these people who actually make the real decisions, whether in the national interest or not, and they are the ones who effectively decide who is in office. Unsurprisingly, these are the people whom President Xi surrounded himself with in San Francisco &ndash; because he knows they matter the most &ndash; and who also gave him a standing ovation as he spoke, much to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thinking_panda/status/1725472898943738146?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chagrin of Gina Raimondo</a>, the US secretary of commerce.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s worth remembering why these people supported Trump (at first) and Biden, and it&rsquo;s paradoxically for their incompetence. A competent government that does anything besides cut taxes and effectively project American influence abroad is what is most detrimental to the interests of the elite. Yet, such a system, where the less-than-remarkable rise to top positions, is fundamentally unsustainable. This has led to self-cannibalizing political leadership, hence the rapid decline of American power over the past decade &ndash; and the fact that a bumbling moron like Biden can be anywhere near the Oval Office in the first place.</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/6558f2f885f5404e26073bd7.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Sat, 18 Nov 2023 19:41:38 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"Musk to punish ‘genocide advocates’","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/587568-elon-musk-x-genocide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/587568-elon-musk-x-genocide/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/655904f985f5406ce2140091.jpg\" /> Elon Musk has said that anyone found to be showing sympathy to the genocide of any group will be banned from his X social media platform <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587568-elon-musk-x-genocide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>The X chief’s comments come days after he was heavily criticized for appearing to agree with an anti-Semitic post on the platform</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Elon Musk, owner the X social media network (formerly Twitter) has said that anyone appearing to condone or advocate for the genocide of any group of people on the service will be removed from the platform.</p>\n<p>Musk, who last year finalized a multi-billion-dollar takeover of the company he later rebranded as X, has faced accusations that hate speech, including anti-Semitism, has increased significantly under his leadership.

It can still finance both its economy and state power unusually cheaply and, in addition, it can misuse the dollar&rsquo;s global reserve and trade functions to confiscate and coerce. The injudicious over-use of this leverage has <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/future-dollar-hegemony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">begun</a> to backfire. Critically excessive national <a href=\"https://www.jeffsachs.org/newspaper-articles/2x6jggs466xgktphxb7shm4ckzn47r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt</a>&nbsp;and the inevitable mobilization of resistance and alternatives to the dollar&rsquo;s power both point to the erosion of US monetary hegemony. For now, it is a fact still to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>All this economic oomph translates into enormous military budgets. Whether in nominal terms or adjusted for purchasing power, America <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/262742/countries-with-the-highest-military-spending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outdistances</a> other nations, with 40% of all money spent on the military worldwide in 2022.</p>\n<p>Indicators could be multiplied, categories refined. Yet the overall picture would not change. At this point in time, the US is still a power giant, and, on top of that, it remains at the top of the most powerful complex of alliances in the world. The sheer size of American power alone tells us little about how it is used. But what is too often overlooked is that without it, America &ndash; whatever its policies &ndash; simply could not be so influential.</p>\n<p>There is clear, again quantitative, evidence that Washington&rsquo;s influence is highly disruptive. According to the conservative journal <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-america-addicted-foreign-interventions-23582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The National Interest</a>, between 1992 and 2017, the US has been involved in 188 &ldquo;<em>military interventions</em>.&rdquo; This list is incomplete; it does not include, for instance, the Gulf War of 1990 or the pivotal role Washington played in provoking and then waging a proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. Moreover, as you would expect, given the source, these are conservative figures. By 2022, Ben Norton, a well-informed critic of US politics on the left found <a href=\"https://mronline.org/2022/09/16/u-s-launched-251-military-interventions-since-1991-and-469-since-1798/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">251 military</a> interventions after 1991.</p>\n<p>The US has not only shown a high propensity to pursue its perceived interests abroad by military force &ndash; instead of diplomacy or even <em>&ldquo;merely&rdquo;</em> economic warfare, i.e. sanctions. What is at least equally concerning is that this preference for direct violence as a tool of policy is accelerating. The National Interest finds that &ndash; again between 1992 and 2017 &ndash; America was engaged in four times as many military interventions as between 1948 and 1991 <em>(&ldquo;only&rdquo;</em> 46 times). Likewise, the Military Intervention Project at Tufts University&rsquo;s Center for Strategic Studies has <a href=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/css/mip-research/#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found</a> that the US &ldquo;<em>has undertaken over 500 international military interventions since 1776, with nearly 60% undertaken between 1950 and 2017</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>over one-third&rdquo;</em> of these missions occurring after 1999. US bellicosity has grown over time (though not evenly) and, recently, after the end of the Cold War and the former Soviet Union, that growth has sped up.</p>\n<p>These wars, moreover, have been extremely destructive. According to exhaustive research conducted by the Costs of War project at Brown University, the so-called &ldquo;<em>Global War on Terror</em>&rdquo; after 2001 alone <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">produced</a> between 905,000 and 940,000 <em>&ldquo;direct war deaths.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;The same research project notes that the &ldquo;<em>destruction of economies, public&nbsp;services, infrastructure, and the environment</em>&rdquo; by these wars has caused an <em>additional</em> &ldquo;<em>3.6-3.8 million indirect <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2023/IndirectDeaths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deaths</a> in post-9/11 war zones.&rdquo;</em> The fact that most of these deaths were <em>&ldquo;indirect&rdquo;</em> shows that, even without engaging in violence directly, Washington has an extraordinary knack of spreading lethal disruption.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65528d3985f540533631811d.jpg\" alt=\"US Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI)\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587195-israel-hamas-us-politics-tlaib/\">How the Israel-Hamas war poisons US politics</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>If the use and promotion of military violence by the US is so globally destabilizing, how about economic warfare? Here as well, we see a clear escalation. A recent op-ed by the New York Times editorial board noted that, <em>&ldquo;over the past two decades, economic sanctions have become a tool of first resort for US policymakers.</em>&rdquo; Between 2000 and 2021, for instance, the Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/opinion/sanctions-biden-venezuela.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grew</a> by more than tenfold, from 912 to 9,421 entries, &ldquo;<em>largely because of the growing use of banking sanctions against individuals.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the long term, since 1950, the US has been &ldquo;<em>responsible for the most sanctions cases&rdquo;</em> in the world, by far. The American share of 42% <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/world/economic-sanctions-history.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outdistances</a> the runners-up, the EU (and its predecessor organizations) on 12%, and the United Nations on 7%.&nbsp;The official ideology of sanctions foregrounds their putative positive sides. Short of war, they are supposed to coerce states, organizations, and individuals into complying with things such as human rights or the vague rules of the so-called rules-based order.</p>\n<p>Wide open to manipulation and bad faith as these justifications are, what is worse is that, in reality, US sanctions serve narrowly defined US interests and are subject to the demagogic appeals that constitute much of US domestic politics. There are probably no more telling cases of this systemic flaw than America&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/06/10/iran-nuclear-deal-cameras-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reneging</a> on the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPoA), the sanctions <a href=\"https://www.jeffsachs.org/interviewsandmedia/3mlhhwrk72bmw9zehsntrrebc8x7ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regime</a> against Russia, and the economic war against China, including the recent &ndash; futile &ndash; attempt to block and even <a href=\"https://www.jeffsachs.org/newspaper-articles/us-economic-war-on-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roll</a> back China&rsquo;s development of AI technologies.</p>\n<p>Sanctions also disproportionately harm poor &ndash; and politically powerless &ndash; populations. As a comprehensive study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research on the &ldquo;<em>Human Consequences of Economic Sanctions&rdquo;</em> has <a href=\"https://cepr.net/report/the-human-consequences-of-economic-sanctions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">established</a>, &ldquo;<em>sanctions have negative effects on outcomes ranging from per capita income to poverty, inequality, mortality, and human rights.</em>&rdquo; Blanket sanctions on Venezuela&rsquo;s oil industry in 2018, for instance, <em>&ldquo;deepened what was already the worst economic contraction in Latin America in decades,&rdquo; and caused &ldquo;significant increases in poverty,</em>&rdquo; as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/opinion/sanctions-biden-venezuela.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summarized</a> a study by Francisco Rodr&iacute;guez from the University of Denver. These US policies are not only unethical, they also destabilize whole societies and states, often in especially sensitive regions.</p>\n<p>Washington&rsquo;s recent track record is clear enough. But it does not predict the future: Will the US stay its current course, or will it adopt a less violent and more diplomacy-centered approach, as recommended by some moderate domestic critics? The Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, for instance, is explicit about the &ldquo;<em>practical and moral failures of US efforts to unilaterally shape the destiny of other nations by force,</em>&rdquo; and seeks to <a href=\"https://quincyinst.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">promote</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;a fundamental rethinking of US foreign policy assumptions.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The chances for a truly fundamental course correction seem slim. For one thing, there are few signs of any desire for it among either Democrats or Republicans. Instead, the top politicians of both parties tend to <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/foreign-policy-bipartisanships-mixed-blessings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compete</a> over who can offer a more robust insistence on US preeminence. Consider, for instance, the response of two former <em>&ldquo;insurgents&rdquo;</em> to Israel&rsquo;s assault on Gaza. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have staked positions in alignment with current Biden administration policy. Trump, who, unlike Sanders, is running for the president&rsquo;s office again &ndash; and has a realistic chance of winning &ndash; has criticized Israel for being unreliable, failing to prevent the Hamas attack of 7 October, and losing the battle for public opinion. But he has not <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trump-says-israel-losing-public-213213196.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called</a> Israel out for excessive civilian deaths and what multiple world leaders and officials, as well as UN human rights experts, have called war crimes. Sanders has been, if anything, even more conformist, explicitly rejecting a ceasefire, despite the predictable and deserved blowback, <a href=\"https://normanfinkelstein.substack.com/p/a-response-to-senator-bernie-sanders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exemplified</a> in a scathing response from the eminent scholar and prominent public intellectual Norman Finkelstein.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the influence of the military-industrial complex is increasing; the financial interest in a foreign policy privileging the military is strong and well-articulated by lobbyism and think-tanks that shape not only politics narrowly <a href=\"https://quincyinst.org/report/defense-contractor-funded-think-tanks-dominate-ukraine-debate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">understood</a> but public debate as well.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65468f3385f5407b64138308.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of the Lebanese movement Hezbollah watch a televised speech by its leader Hassan Nasrallah in Baghdad on November 3, 2023\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/586581-us-hezbollah-hamas-israel/\">Scott Ritter: The US and Hezbollah want the same thing from Israel-Hamas war</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Thirdly, despite some critical journalism, US mainstream media still preponderantly <a href=\"https://politicalscience.ceu.edu/article/2020-12-01/how-united-states-mainstream-media-frames-foreign-policy-issues-comparative-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affirm</a> the bipartisan foreign policy consensus.&nbsp;By and large, America does not even have a forum for healthy and diverse public debates on principally revising its approach to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, up until now, the multiplying signs of a relative decline of American power, as measured against the emergence of other power centers in the shape of single countries or associations of states, have not made the US elite lower its expectations. On the contrary, there is a constant, reiterative process of doubling down, from the rout of Kabul in 2021 to the proxy war in Ukraine of 2022. And once that is about to be lost, a virtually seamless transition to another big gamble in the Middle East. And persistent tension with China not only over trade wars, but Taiwan is always in the background. That is the mindset reflected in New York Times articles asking whether <em>&ldquo;America can support two wars,&rdquo;</em> (in Ukraine and the Middle East) and &ldquo;<em>still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/asia/gaza-israel-asia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">handle</a> China.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>If history teaches anything then it is that trend extrapolation is a hard, thankless business, because the limits of our imagination &ndash; even if well-equipped with method and data &ndash; are always narrower than those of reality. Maybe we are on the cusp of major generational shifts &ndash; in values and ethnic self-identification &ndash; in American society. Perhaps, all US trends will be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/11/1071082955/imagine-another-american-civil-war-but-this-time-in-every-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upset</a> by the Civil War 2.0 that some conventional observers already call a <em>&ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;</em> notion. In any case, prudence requires to assume that the problem of global US disruptiveness will not solve itself or go away soon or, for that matter, easily. The most important challenge of international security, therefore, is to manage a US that is especially dangerous now, by historical standards, and, even in decline, remains extremely powerful. It is sad to say, but in terms of achieving global stability, America is precisely not what it imagines itself to be: an <em>&ldquo;indispensable&rdquo;</em> part of the solution. In reality, it is the single worst problem.&nbsp;</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65562076203027409c50f426.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 18:58:37 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"Sunak vows to ‘take on’ critics of Rwanda deportation plan","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/587511-uk-sunak-rwanda-asylum-critics/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/587511-uk-sunak-rwanda-asylum-critics/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/6557a75785f5405b8f5339c3.jpg\" /> UK PM Rishi Sunak has pledged to confront opponents of his government’s controversial plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587511-uk-sunak-rwanda-asylum-critics/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>A UK government scheme to send asylum seekers to the African country has been deemed unlawful by London’s highest court</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he intends to confront critics of his government&rsquo;s controversial plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, days after the proposal was struck down by London&rsquo;s Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The Rwanda asylum policy, which was part of a campaign pledge by Sunak to vastly reduce the flow of immigrants arriving into the UK on small boats across the English Channel, would see those arriving illegally deported to the African nation.</p>\n<p>However, on Wednesday the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the policy was not actionable.

The US president nonetheless attempted to frame the summit as a victory, especially over the political football of fentanyl, as well as the resumption of &ldquo;military communications&rdquo; with China, but nonetheless continually framed Beijing as a competitor.</p>\n<p>What were these talks all about? While China had a vested interest in stabilizing the relationship and cooling things down, there was also a wider competition at play. Xi Jinping&rsquo;s attendance was in fact a strong political message not just intended for the US itself, but also aimed at diluting America&rsquo;s influence on the APEC members when it has the home turf.</p>\n<p>APEC, an acronym for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, is an economic bloc which comprises 21 countries in Asia, the Pacific and North America. This includes all of Maritime South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Russia.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/6555d4a4203027584669deac.jpg\" alt=\"US President Joe Biden meets Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative conference in San Francisco.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587385-china-biden-xi-dictator/\">China brands Biden ‘irresponsible’</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>This year, the US is the chair and host, so it was inevitable that Washington would try to steer the summit towards projecting its own geopolitical goals in the region, which are targeted at opposing and containing China. It is also important to note that Taiwan, a principal source of tension between Washington and Beijing, also takes part in APEC summits separately from Beijing, which is seen by Western observers as a rare opportunity for the region to be heard at an official level, even though its representatives are civilians rather than its local government officials.</p>\n<p>Between the US and China, the summit is in effect a competition for influence over shaping the future of the Asia-Pacific region, which has special consequences for it being in San Francisco. While China has often shunned high-level engagement with the US by playing hard to get and using hardball negotiating tactics, in the case of the APEC summit you have to be in the game to win it. If China doesn&rsquo;t send its leader, then the US subsequently gains more power in shifting the agenda.</p>\n<p>However, through attending, Xi Jinping has escalated the political stakes for the other countries involved by stressing the importance of the event in diplomatic terms, and therefore creating more equilibrium between the US and China, showing of course just how much significance China places on not being diplomatically isolated in this highly consequential region. Thus, the decision was made by Xi to go face to face.</p>\n<p>In terms of individual relations between the two countries, the event as a whole and its outcomes are arguably a positive development given the negative trajectory that has occurred, especially at the start of this year. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the bilateral ties do not have a ceiling and that was quite clear in the lack of substance in the overall results. The US presidential election is now only a year away, and that&rsquo;s why Biden didn&rsquo;t lavish concessions on Xi during this meeting. He agreed to be more constructive, but also framed it in a way that he was getting concessions from China, such as over fentanyl. Beijing has become a scapegoat for America&rsquo;s addiction problem and the two leaders apparently agreed on working to curb the production of the drug, whose precursors, Washington claims, come from China.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65557bb585f54053543d64d4.jpg\" alt=\"US President Joe Biden (R) and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together after a meeting during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders&#039; week in Woodside, California on November 15, 2023.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587371-us-china-military-contacts/\">US and China agree to resume military communication</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Under no circumstances would Biden allow this meeting to be seen as a &ldquo;capitulation&rdquo; to Beijing and because of that, US strategic objectives, be it through domestic pressures or international ones, are not liable to change significantly. While Washington has become more amicable towards Beijing in recent months, toning down hostile rhetoric over issues such as Taiwan, little else has changed. The US continues to blacklist and embargo Chinese technology companies in the semiconductor industry and still pursues its campaign of military encirclement around Beijing by arming Taiwan and egging the Philippines on to escalate tensions in the South China Sea.</p>\n<p>None of that is going to change, the US continues to have its sights on China as its largest competitor and seeks to affirmably reshape the international order to secure its permanent dominance. That includes military capabilities, alliances, technology and of course economics and trade. The US may be less hostile to China, but it very much seeks to suppress its rise wherever possible. Therefore, as the joint statement showed, this was about &ldquo;managing competition&rdquo; between the two, all the while Biden continues to posture about how he&rsquo;s being tough on Beijing and defending American interests.</p>\n<p>For Xi, the goal is much broader. Not only does he buy China strategic time by at least cooling the waters with the US and preventing a complete deterioration of ties, but in this summit he undoubtedly eyed many more Asia-Pacific leaders with the precise goal of diluting US influence.</p>\n<p>This is especially significant since most of APEC members (bar the US) are also members of the CPTPP, the trade bloc which China wants to join, and it has already <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3239166/china-australia-relations-anthony-albaneses-visit-canberra-will-not-oppose-beijings-cptpp-bid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">got Australia on board to publicly support it</a>.

In this case, Xi&rsquo;s attendance at APEC is about China&rsquo;s own diplomatic ambitions rather than truly resetting ties with the US.

Cameron was one of the earliest proponents of anti-Russian cancel culture, having led the charge for Moscow to be kicked out of the G8 in 2014.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/654e3ef12030273596659195.jpg\" alt=\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks with media at press conference at the end of EU Leaders Summit on October 27, 2023 in Brussels, Belgium.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587003-eu-praises-ukraines-achievements/\">The EU praises Ukraine’s ‘achievements,’ but in reality they are laughable</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Cameron had mercifully dropped off the political radar since leaving office in 2016.

In the United States, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party are <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/176873/let-go-voicemail-democrats-reportedly-ignoring-calls-ceasefire-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reportedly ducking calls</a> from concerned constituents who are calling for a ceasefire.

When politicians ignore popular will, it shows that there is a serious crisis with the ordinary function of supposedly democratic institutions.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it must be noted that Biden has not shied away from his pro-Israel leanings. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYLNCcLfIkM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">To quote then-Senator Joe Biden, a self-described Zionist, from 1986</a>, <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no apology to be made </em>[for supporting Israel]<em>.

The fact that he is staying firm on his position with Israel, despite protests from his own party and reportedly his own staff, is a grave mistake.</p>\n<p>The situation in Europe is also more nuanced.

France has also outlawed pro-Palestine protests. But some countries, like Ireland and Spain, are openly critical of Israel and are considering cutting diplomatic ties.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, this disunity demonstrates the fragility of a common EU foreign policy framework. This is especially the case given the fact that Ursula von der Leyen, the unelected president of the European Commission, has proven to be <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-doubles-down-on-pro-israel-stance-lashes-out-at-iran/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a US-infiltrated, hypocritical pro-war demagogue</a>.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s clear as day in the current situation in the Middle East is that each and every day that the attack on Gaza continues, it becomes more difficult to morally and logically justify the common Western position of supporting Israel no matter what. The rest of the world sees this and is taking note, understanding the days of Western hegemony are numbered. Moreover, the leaders who are holding firm on the pro-Israel line despite immense and unprecedented public pressure are inadvertently eroding the very fabric of the fundamental institutions of Western society.</p>\n<p>As a growing number of people in the West become jaded with democracy, or, in the case of the EU, become skeptical of Brussels, the leaders who ignore their constituents only have themselves to blame.</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/655536f5203027584669de89.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:33:10 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"Taiwanese election could tilt in Beijing’s favor","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/587362-taiwanese-opposition-parties-agree-to-combine-forces/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/587362-taiwanese-opposition-parties-agree-to-combine-forces/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65552ed620302754da542e27.jpg\" /> Taiwanese opposition parties agree to unite in January election, boosting the chances of ousting the anti-China party from power <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587362-taiwanese-opposition-parties-agree-to-combine-forces/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>Opposition parties have agreed to join forces in Taipei, raising chances of a change in power on the island</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Taiwan&rsquo;s leading opposition parties have agreed to combine forces with a joint ticket in January&rsquo;s presidential election, consolidating their political support and boosting their chances of forming a more China-friendly government in Taipei.</p>\n<p>The Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People&rsquo;s Party (TPP) formed their new alliance on Wednesday, agreeing to settle on a single presidential candidate rather than splitting the vote.

One of the main objectives of the journey was to impress Russia's allies before hostilities kicked off. To this end, as the historic tale goes, Russian military leader and statesman Grigory Potemkin constructed &lsquo;mobile villages&rsquo; along the banks of the Dnieper River. Once the ship carrying the Empress and her court appeared, Potemkin's men, impersonating happy and well-fed peasants, populated the improvised village. After the ship had passed, the entire set was quickly disassembled and rebuilt further downstream, thus the term &lsquo;Potemkin village.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>It has to be said that this story is largely regarded as fictional nowadays. Potemkin apparently did try to make the devastated countryside look more presentable, but how far he went remains disputed. The claims that he was actually trying to deceive the Empress and the ambassadors, rather than simply make things look prettier or advertise the ongoing post-war reconstruction, are attributed to his many detractors at court.</p>\n<p>The task facing San Francisco is a bit more challenging than what faced imperial Russia.

The result of these equally futile efforts was a document doomed to be a short and rather inglorious footnote in history. A year later, the Soviet Union &ndash; and the Warsaw Pact it had led &ndash; ceased to exist.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then within five years the decision was taken to expand NATO eastwards, and by the end of the 1990s the West had finally given up any illusions about the possibility of building a common security space in Europe.</p>\n<p>Did anyone have such a hope from the start? Not necessarily. But the historical context meant it seemed sensible to try to end the Cold War in a way that was different from all the major military and political confrontations of the past. Especially in international politics, one can never rule out the possibility that seemingly unsuccessful temporary solutions will become the basis for a more stable order. This did not happen in Europe after the Cold War. But Russian foreign policy would have betrayed itself and its culture if it had been too eager to part with the treaty before any hope of reviving it had been lost.</p>\n<p>Now Europe has returned to the historically familiar confrontation between Russia and the combined forces of the West. It is our country which is the only one of all non-Western civilizations that has never lost in the struggle for its unique niche in world politics. And this, unfortunately, makes conflict a much more natural phenomenon of European political life than peaceful cooperation. Although diplomacy should, of course, strive for the latter form of relations. That is why Russia made comprehensive proposals to NATO in December 2021 on issues fundamental to European security. The Western partners then refused to engage in serious dialogue, preferring the military-technical scenario of a crisis of the international order in Europe.</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.08/thumbnail/64e8631a20302702605696f6.jpg\" alt=\"President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen (L), the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy (C) and the President of the European Council Charles Michel (R) leave after a Visit by the Ukrainian President to the EU on February 9, 2023 in Brussels, Belgium.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/581798-bordachev-ukraine-in-eu/\">Timofey Bordachev: Ukraine in the EU will only exacerbate the bloc’s growing irrelevance</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>In technical terms, the CFE Treaty was based on the establishment of certain limits on the presence of the parties' major conventional weapons within a defined geographical area&nbsp;&ndash; from the Atlantic to the Urals. The fact that these limits were set in the context of two military alliances&nbsp;&ndash; NATO and the Warsaw Pact&nbsp;&ndash; made the treaty short-lived. By 1990, few doubted that the Soviet-led bloc would not last long. The second peculiarity of the CFE Treaty was the presence of the US: a state that was clearly not in Europe and that viewed regional security from a very different perspective. The deal thus effectively consolidated the American military presence in the <em>&ldquo;Old World.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, this was a problem with the whole design of the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Europe (OSCE): it included two powers, the US and Canada, for whom the position on the continent was not a matter of security but of strategy. First and foremost, of course, for Washington, since the Canadian presence was always only a small complement to the American one. This meant that within the framework of the CFE there were states with fundamentally different interests in relation to its tasks and activities.</p>\n<p>Peace in Europe as such has never been a goal for the US, but only a means of maintaining its global position. After the Cold War, Washington was able to take the place of the strongest in the world hierarchy, and any European agreements only interested it from this point of view.</p>\n<p>For us Europeans, the CFE Treaty may have had a practical significance in the field of security. After the Cold War, the countries of Western Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, were rather rosy about their future. Led by Germany and France, they sincerely hoped to gradually rid themselves of humiliating American control and regain the sovereignty they had lost after the Second World War. Paris and Berlin enthusiastically welcomed the CFE Treaty, especially as it allowed them to significantly reduce their military spending.</p>\n<p>Adapted in 1999 to the \"<em>new realities,</em>\" the euphemism for NATO's aggressive post-Cold War eastward expansion, the CFE Treaty was never ratified by the Western parties. Only Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine completed the process. The US and its allies refused to do so, citing the presence of Russian peacekeeping contingents in Georgia and Moldova.</p>\n<p>Even in the late 1990s, when relations between Russia and the West were far from confrontational, the US and the EU saw the most important European security agreements as a tool to put pressure on Moscow. They were used by the West purely instrumentally and as part of a broader policy.</p>\n<p>The rationale was to reduce Russia's ability to effectively confront NATO in the event of a direct military conflict. After Moscow had opposed the aggression of the US and its allies against Yugoslavia, such a conflict was seen in the West as inevitable in the future. Washington and Brussels began to systematically expand the territorial base from which they could fight Russia. Moreover, NATO had no practical reason to support the treaty&nbsp;&ndash; the accession of former Soviet allies meant that the total number of weapons in the bloc exceeded the limits set by the treaty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n            ","\n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/654e3ef12030273596659195.jpg\" alt=\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks with media at press conference at the end of EU Leaders Summit on October 27, 2023 in Brussels, Belgium.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587003-eu-praises-ukraines-achievements/\">The EU praises Ukraine’s ‘achievements,’ but in reality they are laughable</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n","\n    \n\n<p>Russia itself decided to suspend the treaty only in 2007. The most important factor was the restoration of our military capabilities and the ability to conduct an independent foreign policy. And in the conditions of the time, any independence in global affairs automatically meant conflict with the US, which did not tolerate any will but its own.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, Moscow declared a moratorium on the implementation of the CFE Treaty, but until 2015 it participated in the activities of the treaty's main body, the Joint Contact Group (JCG). It still hoped that the West would change its mind and decide to return to the basic ideas of the 1990 deal. When Russia realized that this was pointless, the JCG's work effectively ceased. Finally, in 2023, Moscow decided to denounce the treaty, which entered into force at midnight on November 7.</p>\n<p>As we can see, Russia's farewell to the CFE Treaty was very long and full of hope that our partners would be able to change their selfish attitude towards one of the most important issues of European security. This is the peculiarity of Russian diplomacy and foreign policy culture, which is based on patience and far-sighted moderation. And nobody has any right to tell a country with more than 500 years of sovereign history how to behave.</p>\n<p>The turbulent events of the 20th century have meant that of all the states in Europe, only Russia remains capable of making independent foreign policy decisions. This means that Moscow bears the main responsibility for the wisdom and balance of its decisions. Is an agreement similar to the CFE Treaty possible in the future? That depends on when European security becomes a matter for Europeans themselves again.</p>"]},"enclosure":{"@url":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/6553732a20302740c31eec42.jpg","@type":"image/jpeg","@length":"123"},"pubDate":"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 13:43:50 +0000","dc:creator":"RT"},{"title":"PHOTOS of White House cocaine released to media","link":{"#cdata-section":"https://www.rt.com/news/587247-white-house-cocaine-photos/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"},"guid":"https://www.rt.com/news/587247-white-house-cocaine-photos/","description":{"#cdata-section":"<img alt=\"Preview\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 10px;\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.11/thumbnail/65536f2020302714ac3a5506.jpg\" /> The Daily Mail has published images and documents related to the Secret Service investigation into a bag of cocaine found at the White House <br/><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/587247-white-house-cocaine-photos/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\">Read Full Article at RT.com</a>"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":["\n                            <p><strong>The drug at the president’s residence was cut with baking soda, the Daily Mail has revealed</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>New details about the case of a bag of cocaine found at the White House last summer have been published by British tabloid the Daily Mail, which obtained documents and images through a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>\n<p>The package, which was discovered in a phone locker of the West Wing on July 2, sparked a scandal after an investigation failed to identify the culprit.
