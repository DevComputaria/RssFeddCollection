The EFF said the following at the time:</p><blockquote>If the country&apos;s ruling regime were to successfully implement this plan, it would be able to snoop on, impersonate, and alter the online communications of anyone within their borders&#x2014;effectively performing a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack?ref=troyhunt.com\">Man in the Middle</a>&#xA0;attack on its entire population.</blockquote><p>Now watch the video, listen to Scott and ask yourself how different the technical capacity he discusses is from the Kazakhstan situation. Not from a policy perspective or the intentions of the respective government bodies, but rather it terms of the capabilities and lack of transparency it results in. It&apos;s nuts.

That&apos;s the context that accompanied a <em>massive </em>trove of data that was sent to me 2 years ago now. I looked into it, tried to attribute and verify it then put it in the &quot;too hard basket&quot; and moved onto more pressing issues.

How many companies called &quot;Acuity&quot; that have been breached are there?!

So how many &quot;Acuity&quot; companies are out there in total?! Just in the course of investigating this data, I came across a total of 6 of them that as far as I can tell, are completely unrelated:</p><ol><li>Acuity Healthcare (definitely breached): <a href=\"https://acuity.healthcare/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuity.healthcare</a></li><li>Acuity Brands (definitely breached): <a href=\"https://www.acuitybrands.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuitybrands.com</a></li><li>Acuity Scheduling (maybe breached): <a href=\"https://www.acuityscheduling.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuityscheduling.com</a></li><li>Acuity Insurance: <a href=\"https://www.acuity.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuity.com</a></li><li>Acuity &quot;Innovative technical solutions for Federal agencies that support the National Security &amp; Public Safety missions&quot;: <a href=\"https://myacuity.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">myacuity.com</a></li><li>Acuity Ads: <a href=\"https://www.acuityads.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">acuityads.com</a> (now redirects to <a href=\"https://illumin.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\">illumin.com</a>)</li></ol><p>Ugh, great. We&apos;ll work through them and try to figure out where they fit into the picture in a moment, but first let&apos;s look at the actual data. We already know it&apos;s 437GB, but it&apos;s the breadth of column headings that&apos;s most stunning; here&apos;s all 414 of them:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<style>\n.gist-data{\n    height:300px;\n    overflow-y: visible;\n}\n</style>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/troyhunt/74c150d9f02380df3de8fcaf03bc78c0.js\"></script>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>Just by eyeballing these, it really doesn&apos;t feel like the sort of data that comes from a healthcare provider, a brands company or a scheduler. The other 3, however... Maybe.</p><p>Some more data points before going further:</p><ol><li>The files is named &quot;ACUITY_MASTER_18062020.csv&quot; (this is the date I&apos;ve elected to stamp the breach with - 18 June 2020)</li><li>There are 21,873,706 email addresses in the file</li><li>Of those, &quot;only&quot; 14,055,729 are unique so there&apos;s some redundancy</li><li>The data is cleansed and formatted in a fashion that definitely isn&apos;t reflective of how data is entered by end users</li></ol><p>On that final point, here&apos;s an example of what I&apos;m talking about:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who? Attempts and Failures to Attribute 437GB of Breached Data\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"166\" height=\"730\"></figure><p>The last names are the same, as are the salutations. The physical addresses are spot on accurate in their structure as are the phone numbers; there are no spaces, no dashes and no other artifacts typical of millions of different humans entering data. This is clean - <em>too</em> clean.</p><p>The &quot;datasource&quot; field is another interesting data point with the top 10 values being:</p><ol><li>Buy.com</li><li>Popularliving.com</li><li>studentsreview.com</li><li>TAGGED.COM</li><li>jamster.com</li><li>Expedia.com</li><li>cbsmarketwatch.com</li><li>netflix.com</li><li>selfwealthsystem.com</li><li>gocollegedegree.com</li></ol><p>Each of these entries appeared at least hundreds of thousands of times, if not millions. Does that mean that Netflix, for example, provided customer data to this list? Almost certainly no, but it does feel reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/data-breach-misattribution-acxiom-live-ramp/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Acxiom / Live Ramp misattribution post I wrote a year ago</a> where I listed full counts of a similar column. One of the top values there was also &quot;TAGGED.COM&quot; (also all in uppercase), alongside several other values that also appeared in both sources.</p><p>Back to attribution and a post on a popular hacking forum jumps out:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who?

The attribution is to the insurance company named &quot;Acuity&quot;, but is that accurate? Insurance companies collect a lot of data as it&apos;s relevant to how they run their business, but that data is <em>highly</em> unlikely to include fields such as:</p><ol><li>SpectatorSportsBasketball</li><li>SewingKnittingNeedlework</li><li>PresenceOfUpscaleRetailCard</li></ol>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<p>That&apos;s much more in the &quot;data enrichment&quot;  space where a company sells a massive data set so that it can expand the profile data of the purchaser&apos;s existing customer base. It&apos;s a <del>legitimate</del>, <del>honest</del>, legal business model. It&apos;s also indistinguishable from this:</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who?

And the column names line up! And it&apos;s called Acuity! Slightly different column count to mine (and similar but different to the hacker forum post), and slightly different email count, but the similarities remain striking. How I got to this resource is also interesting, having come by someone I was discussing the data with a couple of years ago:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Acuity Who?

Could that indicate the data as coming from Acuity <em>Ads</em> (now <a href=\"https://illumin.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Illumin</a>)? No, not in and of itself, the walkthrough there isn&apos;t that dissimilar to other campaign tools I&apos;ve used in the past. No matter how much I looked, I just couldn&apos;t find a solid lead back to Acuity Ads and anything even remotely related was merely circumstantial. It <em>could</em> be from them, but it could also be from many other places and the mere fact that a near identical corpus of data was sitting there on an outright spam site only makes the whole mystery that much deeper. There was just one more interesting data point in that email:</p><blockquote>i myself am in that dataset and i&apos;ve been getting 100x more phishing/scam calls, emails, and physical mail</blockquote><p>Let me end this with a best guess: this feels like the same situation as <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/questions-about-the-massive-south-african-master-deeds-data-breach-answered/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the massive Master Deeds incident in South Africa in 2017</a>. In that case, a legally operating data aggregator (I think you know how I feel about those by now...) sold personal information to a real estate business who then left it publicly exposed. I say it <em>feels </em>the same because it&apos;s just such a clean set of data and it&apos;s clearly <em>very</em> comprehensive in terms of the columns. It&apos;s exactly what I&apos;d expect a data aggregator to prepare and sell to other businesses so they could identify which of their existing customers likes needlework.</p><p>In the past, publishing blog posts like this has helped identify an origin service and if that happens again here then I&apos;ll be sure to provide an update. For now, I&apos;ve loaded it into HIBP and flagged it as a <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs?ref=troyhunt.com#SpamList\" rel=\"noreferrer\">spam list</a> which means it won&apos;t impact the size of anyone&apos;s domains and bump them into a different subscription level. If you do have any interesting insights on this data, please leave a comment below and with any luck, one of the Acuity entities out there will emerge as the source.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> just after loading the data, I ran the calcs on how many of the addresses were pre-existing in HIBP. This seems like a statistically significant number &#x1F632;</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, 100% (just under actually, but it rounded up). Working through a bunch of sample addresses, they appeared across all sorts of other existing spam lists and dodgy data aggregator breaches.

You start out with a theory (a set of data coming from an alleged source), but you don&apos;t have a vested interested in whether the claim is true or not, rather you follow the evidence and see where it leads. Verification that supports the alleged source is <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-how-i-verify-data-breaches/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">usually quite straightforward</a>, but <em>disproving</em> a claim can be a rather time consuming exercise, especially when a dataset contains fragments of truth mixed in with data that is anything but.

Well, <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/observations-and-thoughts-on-the-linkedin-data-breach/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">they were <em>proper </em>breached in 2012 to the tune of 164M records</a> (by which I mean that incident was genuinely internal data such as email addresses and passwords extracted out by a vulnerability), then <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-data-scraped-500-million-users-for-sale-online-2021-4?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">they were massively scraped in 2021</a> with another 126M records going into <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Have I Been Pwned</a> (HIBP). So, when you see a claim like the one above, it seems highly feasible at face value which is what many people take it at. But I&apos;m a bit more suspicious than most people &#x1F642;</p><p>First, the claim:</p><blockquote>This one is similar to my twitter data scrapped [sic] but for linkedin plus 2023</blockquote><p>Now, there&apos;s a whole debate about whether scraped data is breached data and indeed whether the definition of it even matters. With the rising prevalence of scraped data, this topic came up enough that <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/when-is-a-scrape-a-breach/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I wrote a dedicated blog post about it a couple of years ago</a> and concluded the following in terms of how we should define the term &quot;breach&quot;:</p><blockquote>A data breach occurs when information is obtained by an unauthorised party in a fashion in which it was not intended to be made available</blockquote><p>Which makes scrapes like this alleged one a breach. If indeed it was accurate, LinkedIn data had been taken and redistributed in a way it was never intended to be by either the service itself or the individuals whose data was in this corpus. So, it&apos;s something to take seriously, and that warranted further investigation.</p><p>I scrolled through the 10M+ rows of data (many records spanned multiple rows due to line returns), and my eyes fell on a fellow Aussie who for the purposes of this exercise we&apos;ll call &quot;EM&quot;, being the initials of her first and last name. Whilst the data I&apos;m going to refer to is either public by design or fabricated, I don&apos;t want to use a real person as an example without their consent so let&apos;s just play it safe. Here&apos;s a fragment of EM&apos;s record:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hackers, Scrapers &amp; Fakers: What&apos;s Really Inside the Latest LinkedIn Dataset\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png 854w\"></figure><p>There are 5 noteworthy parts of this I that immediately caught my attention:</p><ol><li>There are 5 different email addresses here with the alias for each one represented in &quot;[first name].[last name]@&quot; form. These exist in a column titled &quot;PROFILE_USERNAMES&quot;. (Incidentally, this is why the headline of 2.5M accounts expands out to 5.8M email addresses as there are often multiple addresses per account.)</li><li>There&apos;s a LinkedIn profile ID in the form of &quot;[first name]-[last name]-[random hexadecimal chars]&quot; under a column titled &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_ID&quot;. That successfully loaded EM&apos;s legitimate profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/[id]/</li><li>The numeric value in the &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_MEMBER_ID&quot; column matched with the value on EM&apos;s profile from the previous point.</li><li>The 2 dates starting with &quot;2020-&quot; are in columns titled &quot;PROFILE_FETCHED_AT&quot; and &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_FETCHED_AT&quot;. I assume these are self-explanatory.</li><li>EM&apos;s first and last name, precisely as it appears in each of her 5 email addresses.</li></ol><p>On its own, this record would be unremarkable. It&apos;d be entirely feasible - <em>this could very well be legit</em> - except when you keep looking through the remainder of the data. A pattern quickly emerged and I&apos;m going to bold it here because it&apos;s the smoking gun that ultimately indicates that a bunch of this data is fake:</p><p><strong>Every single record with multiple email addresses had <em>exactly </em>the same alias on completely unrelated domains and it was <em>almost always</em> in the form of &quot;[first name].[last name]@&quot;.</strong></p><p>Representing email addresses in this fashion is certainly common, but it&apos;s far from ubiquitous, and that&apos;s easy to demonstrate. For example, I have tons of emails from <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/?ref=troyhunt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pluralsight</a> so I dig one out from my friend &quot;CU&quot;:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hackers, Scrapers &amp; Fakers: What&apos;s Really Inside the Latest LinkedIn Dataset\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"368\" height=\"112\"></figure><p>There&apos;s no dot, rather a dash. Every single real Pluralsight email address I looked at was a dash rather than a dot, yet when I delved into the alleged LinkedIn data and dig out another sample Pluralsight address, here&apos;s what I found:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hackers, Scrapers &amp; Fakers: What&apos;s Really Inside the Latest LinkedIn Dataset\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"345\" height=\"38\"></figure><p>That&apos;s not LM&apos;s real address because it has a dot instead of a dash. Every. Single. One. Is. Fake.</p><p>Let&apos;s try this the other way around and load up the existing breached accounts in HIBP for the domain of one of EM&apos;s alleged email addresses and see how they&apos;re formed:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hackers, Scrapers &amp; Fakers: What&apos;s Really Inside the Latest LinkedIn Dataset\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"310\" height=\"392\"></figure><p>That&apos;s definitely not the same format as EM&apos;s address, not by a long shot. And time and time again, the same pattern of addresses in the corpus of data in the original tweet emerged, drawing me to what seems to be a pretty logical conclusion:</p><p><strong>Each email address was fabricated by taking the actual domain of a company the individual legitimately worked at and then constructing the alias from their name.</strong></p><p>And these <em>are</em> legitimate companies too because every single LinkedIn profile I checked had all the cues of accurate information and each domain I checked in the corpus of data was indeed the correct one for the company they worked at. I imagine someone has effectively worked through the following logic:</p><ol><li>Get a list of LinkedIn profiles whether that be by ID or username or simply parsing them out of crawler results</li><li>Scrape the profiles and pull down legitimate information about each individual, including their employment history</li><li>Resolve the domain for each company they worked at and construct the email addresses</li><li>Profit?</li></ol><p>On that final point, what <em>is</em> the point? The data wasn&apos;t being sold in that original tweet, rather it was freely downloadable. But per the date on EM&apos;s profile, the data could have been obtained much earlier and previously monetised. And on that, the date wasn&apos;t constant across records, rather there was a broad range of them as recent as July last year and as old as... well, I stopped when the records got older than me. <em>What is this?!</em></p><p>I suspect the answer may partly lie in the column headings which I&apos;ve pasted here in their entirety:</p><p>&quot;PROFILE_KEY&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_USERNAMES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_IDS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_PUBLIC_IDENTIFIER&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALES_NAVIGATOR_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_MEMBER_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_IDS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_IDS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_PIPL_IDS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_IDS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_LINKEDIN_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_SALES_NAVIGATOR_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_SALESFORCE_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_SPENDESK_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_ASGARD_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_AUTOPILOT_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_PIPL_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HAS_HUBSPOT_SOURCE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALES_NAVIGATOR_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_ASGARD_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_PIPL_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_FETCHED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_IS_NOT_FOUND&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALES_NAVIGATOR_IS_NOT_FOUND&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_EMAILS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_PERSONAL_EMAILS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_PHONES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_FIRST_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LAST_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_TEAM&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HIERARCHY&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_PERSONA&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_GENDER&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COUNTRY_CODE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SUMMARY&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_INDUSTRY_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_BIRTH_YEAR&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_MARVIN_SEARCHES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_POSITION_STARTED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_POSITION_TITLE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_POSITION_LOCATION&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_POSITION_DESCRIPTION&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_LINKEDIN_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_LINKEDIN_UNIVERSAL_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_SALESFORCE_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_SPENDESK_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_COMPANY_HUBSPOT_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SKILLS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LANGUAGES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SCHOOLS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_EXTERNAL_SEARCHES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_HEADLINE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_LINKEDIN_LOCATION&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_CREATED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_STATUS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_LAST_ACTIVITY_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_OWNER_CONTACT_ID&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SALESFORCE_OWNER_CONTACT_NAME&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_SIGNUP_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_DELETED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_ROLES&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_AVERAGE_NPS_SCORE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_NPS_SCORES_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_FIRST_NPS_SCORE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_LAST_NPS_SCORE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_LAST_NPS_SCORE_SENT_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_PAYMENTS_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_TOTAL_EUR_SPENT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_SPENDESK_LAST_ACTIVITY_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_MAIL_CLICKED_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_LAST_MAIL_CLICKED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_MAIL_OPENED_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_LAST_MAIL_OPENED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_MAIL_RECEIVED_COUNT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_LAST_MAIL_RECEIVED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_MAIL_UNSUBSCRIBED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_MAIL_REPLIED_AT&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_LISTS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_AUTOPILOT_SEGMENTS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_CFO_CONNECT_SLACK_MEMBER_STATUS&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_IS_CFO_CONNECT_MEETUPS_MEMBER&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_CFO_CONNECT_AREAS_OF_EXPERTISE&quot;, &quot;PROFILE_HUBSPOT_CORPORATE_FINANCE_EXPERIENCE_YEARS_RANGE&quot;</p><p>Check out some of those names: LinkedIn is obviously there, but so is Salesforce and Spendesk and Hubspot, among others. This reads more like an aggregation of multiple sources than it does data solely scraped from LinkedIn. My hope is that in posting this someone might pop up and say &quot;I recognise those column headings, they&apos;re from...&quot; Who knows.</p><p>So, here&apos;s where that leaves us: this data is a combination of information sourced from public LinkedIn profiles, fabricated emails address and in part (anecdotally based on simply eyeballing the data this is a small part), the other sources in the column headings above. But the people are real, the companies are real, the domains are real and in many cases, the email addresses themselves are real. There are over 1.8k HIBP subscribers in the data set and this is folks that have double opted-in so they&apos;ve successfully received an email to that address in the past. Further, when the data was loaded into HIBP there were nearly a million email addresses that were already in the system so evidently, they were addresses that had previously been in use. Which stands to reason because even if every address was constructed by an algorithm, the pattern is common enough that there&apos;ll be a bunch of hits.</p><p>Because the conclusion is that there&apos;s a significant component of legitimate data in this corpus, I&apos;ve loaded it into HIBP. But because there are also a significant number of fabricated email addresses in there, I&apos;ve flagged it as <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs?ref=troyhunt.com#SpamList\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a spam list</a> which means the addresses won&apos;t impact the scale of anyone&apos;s paid subscription if they&apos;re monitoring domains. And whilst I know some people will suggest it shouldn&apos;t go in at all, time and time again when I&apos;ve polled the public about similar incidents the overwhelming majority of people have said &quot;we want to know about it then we&apos;ll make up our own minds what action needs to be taken&quot;. And in this case, even if you find an email address on your domain that doesn&apos;t actually exist, that person who either currently works at your company or previously did has still had their personal data dumped in this corpus. That&apos;s something most people will still want to know.</p><p>Lastly, one of the main reasons I decided to invest hours into this today is that I <em>loathe</em> disinformation and I <em>hate</em> people using that to then make statements that are completely off base. I&apos;m looking at my Twitter feed now and see people angry at LinkedIn for this, blaming an insider due to recent layoffs there, accusing them of mishandling our data and so on and so forth. No, not this time, the evidence has led us somewhere completely different.</p>"}},{"title":{"#cdata-section":"Weekly Update 372"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Yes, the Lenovo is Chinese.

Here&apos;s a service that enables you to send <em>an actual piece of smelly shit</em> to &quot;An irritating colleague. School teacher. Your ex-wife. Filthy boss. Jealous neighbour. That successful former classmate. Or all those pesky haters.&quot; But it would be weird if the intended recipient of the aforementioned shit knew it came from you, so, Shitexpress makes a bold commitment:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/09/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Safe, Secure, Anonymous, and Other Misleading Claims\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"557\" height=\"195\"></figure><p><em>100% anonymous!</em> Not 90%, not 95% but the full whack 100%!

At the very least, you&apos;re probably going to provide your own email address, your IP will be logged somewhere and payment info will be provided that links back to you (Bitcoin was one of many payment options and is still frequently traceable to an identity). Then of course if it&apos;s a physical good, there&apos;s a delivery address although in the case above, that&apos;s inevitably not going to be the address of the purchaser (sending yourself shit would also just be weird). Which is why following the Shitexpress data breach, we can now easily piece together information such as this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/10/image--2-.png\" alt=\"Safe, Secure, Anonymous, and Other Misleading Claims\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here we have an individual who one day last year, went on an absolute (literal) shit-posting bender posting off half a dozen boxes of excrement to heavy hitters in the US justice system. For 42 minutes, this bright soul (whose IP address was logged with each transaction), sent abusive messages from their iPhone (the user agent is also in the logs) to some of the most powerful people in the land. Did they only do this on the assumption of being &quot;100% anonymous&quot;? Possibly, it certainly doesn&apos;t seem like the sort of activity you&apos;d want to put your actual identity to but hey, here we are. Who knows if there were any precautions taken by this individual to use an IP that wasn&apos;t easily traceable back to them, but that&apos;s not really the point; an attribute that will very likely be tied back to a specific individual if required was captured, stored and then leaked.
