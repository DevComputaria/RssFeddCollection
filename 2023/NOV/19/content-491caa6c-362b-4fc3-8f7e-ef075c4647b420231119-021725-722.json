CERT-UA has monitored Gamaredon operations and was able to gather intelligence on the APT’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check Point states that the Gamaredon group usually carries out large-scale campaigns followed by intelligence-gathering activities. In the latest attacks, the group employed the USB-propagating worm LitterDrifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LitterDrifter worm is written in VBS, it supports two main features: automatic USB propagating and communication with a broad, flexible set of C2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;These features are implemented in a manner that aligns with the group’s goals, effectively maintaining a persistent command and control (C2) channel across a wide array of targets.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/malware-spotlight-into-the-trash-analyzing-litterdrifter/\">analysis</a> published by CheckPoint. &#8220;LitterDrifter seems to be an evolution of a previously reported activity <a href=\"https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shuckworm-russia-ukraine-military\">tying</a> Gamaredon group to a propagating USB Powershell worm.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two functionalities are implemented in an orchestration component saved to disk as “trash.dll”, which is actually a VBS script instead of a DLL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon running the  orchestration component, it decodes and run the other modules and maintains persistence on the infected system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two extracted modules:<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Spreader module</strong> allows the malware to spread within the system and potentially targets other environments by prioritizing infection of a logical disk with mediatype=NULL, usually associated with USB removable media. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>C2 Module</strong> establishes communication with the attacker C&amp;C server and executes incoming payloads. This component retrieves the IP address of the C2 server by generating a random subdomain of a built-in C2 server. It also maintains a backup option by retrieving the IP address of a C2 server from a Telegram channel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Gamaredon’s approach towards the C&amp;C is rather unique, as it utilizes domains as a placeholder for the circulating IP addresses actually used as C2 servers.&#8221; continues the report. &#8220;Before attempting to contact a C2 server, the script checks the <code>%TEMP%</code> folder for an existing C2 configuration file with a meaningless name that’s hardcoded in the malware. This mechanism acts as a self-check for the malware, verifying whether it already infected the machine. If present, the current execution could simply be a scheduled execution triggered by the persistence mechanisms.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Threat actors heavily obfuscated the orchestration component, it is constructed from a series of strings with character substitution obfuscation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png?ssl=1\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"657\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png?resize=728%2C657&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"LitterDrifter Gamaredon\" class=\"wp-image-154366\" style=\"width:552px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Check Point researchers reported possible infections also in the U.S., Vietnam, Chile, Poland, Germany, and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;LitterDrifter doesn’t rely on groundbreaking techniques and may appear to be a relatively unsophisticated piece of malware. However, this same simplicity is in line with its goals, mirroring Gamaredon’s overall approach.&#8221;  concludes the report that also includes Indicators of Compromis. &#8220;This method has demonstrated considerable effectiveness, as evidenced by the group’s sustained activities in Ukraine.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, Symantec researchers <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/147497/apt/gamaredon-targets-ukraine-new-ttps.html\">reported</a> that in some cases, the <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/97992/apt/gamaredon-espionage-campaign.html\"><strong>cyberespionage group</strong></a> remained undetected in the target networks for three months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the attacks began in February/March 2023 and threat actors remained undetected in the target networks until May.

This highlights the importance of ensuring that access to company-wide security tools remains private and only available to authorized personnel,” researchers concluded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recommendations provided by CyberNews researchers are available here:<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cybernews.com/security/vietnam-post-exposes-data-including-email-addresses/\">https://cybernews.com/security/vietnam-post-exposes-data-including-email-addresses/</a><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the author: <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/author/ernestasnaprys/\">Ernestas Naprys</a>, Senior Journalist CyberNews</strong><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\">@securityaffairs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\">Mastodon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;<strong>hacking, critical infrastructure)</strong></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"154271"}},{"title":"Samsung suffered a new data breach","link":"https://securityaffairs.com/154251/data-breach/samsung-data-breach-2.html","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},"pubDate":"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 11:32:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Breaking News"},{"#cdata-section":"Cyber Crime"},{"#cdata-section":"Data Breach"},{"#cdata-section":"Hacking"},{"#cdata-section":"Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"data breach"},{"#cdata-section":"hacking news"},{"#cdata-section":"information security news"},{"#cdata-section":"IT Information Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Pierluigi Paganini"},{"#cdata-section":"Samsung"},{"#cdata-section":"Security Affairs"},{"#cdata-section":"Security News"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://securityaffairs.com/?p=154251"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Samsung Electronics disclosed a data breach that exposed customer personal information to an unauthorized individual.

Any ransoms paid are then split between the group and the affiliates.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhysida actors have been observed leveraging external-facing remote services (e.g. VPNs, RDPs) to gain initial access to the target network and maintain persistence. The group relied on compromised credentials to authenticate to internal VPN access points. According to the advisory, the threat actors have been observed exploiting <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/111138/apt/apt10-zerologon-attacks.html\">Zerologon</a> (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472\">CVE-2020-1472</a>) in Microsoft’s Netlogon Remote Protocol in phishing attempts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group relies on living off-the-land techniques such as native (built into the operating system) network administration tools to perform malicious operations. Below is the list of tools used by the group for its activities:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Name</strong><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cmd.exe</td><td>The native command line prompt utility.</td></tr><tr><td>PowerShell.exe</td><td>A native command line tool used to start a Windows PowerShell session in a Command Prompt window.</td></tr><tr><td>PsExec.exe</td><td>A tool included in the PsTools suite used to execute processes remotely. Rhysida actors heavily leveraged this tool for lateral movement and remote execution.</td></tr><tr><td>mstsc.exe</td><td>A native tool that establishes an RDP connection to a host.</td></tr><tr><td>PuTTY.exe</td><td>Rhysida actors have been observed creating Secure Shell (SSH) PuTTy connections for lateral movement. In one example, analysis of PowerShell console host history for a compromised user account revealed Rhysida actors leveraged PuTTy to remotely connect to systems via SSH [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/004/\">T1021.004</a>].</td></tr><tr><td>PortStarter</td><td>A back door script written in Go that provides functionality for modifying firewall settings and opening ports to pre-configured command and control (C2) servers.[<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/25/dev-0832-vice-society-opportunistic-ransomware-campaigns-impacting-us-education-sector/\">1</a>]</td></tr><tr><td>secretsdump</td><td>A script used to extract credentials and other confidential information from a system. Rhysida actors have been observed using this for NTDS dumping [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/003/\">T1003.003</a>] in various instances.</td></tr><tr><td>ntdsutil.exe</td><td>A standard Windows tool used to interact with the NTDS database. Rhysida actors used this tool to extract and dump the<code>&nbsp;NTDS.dit</code>&nbsp;database from the domain controller containing hashes for all Active Directory (AD) users.<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;It is strongly recommended that organizations conduct domain-wide password resets and double Kerberos TGT password resets if any indication is found that the&nbsp;<code>NTDS.dit</code>&nbsp;file was compromised.</td></tr><tr><td>AnyDesk</td><td>A common software that can be maliciously used by threat actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1219/\">T1219</a>]. AnyDesk also supports remote file transfer.</td></tr><tr><td>wevtutil.exe</td><td>A standard Windows Event Utility tool used to view event logs. Rhysida actors used this tool to clear a significant number of Windows event logs, including system, application, and security logs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/\">T1070.001</a>].</td></tr><tr><td>PowerView</td><td>A PowerShell tool used to gain situational awareness of Windows domains. Review of PowerShell event logs identified Rhysida actors using this tool to conduct additional reconnaissance-based commands and harvest credentials.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The advisory includes mitigations for network defenders along with indicators of compromise (IoCs).<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw><gwmw style=\"display:none;\"></gwmw></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\">@securityaffairs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\">Mastodon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, ransomware)</strong></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"154224"}}]}}}
