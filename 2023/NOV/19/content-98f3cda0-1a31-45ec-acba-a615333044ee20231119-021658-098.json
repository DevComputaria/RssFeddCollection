Hackers are too. As people flock to retailers big and small in search of the best deals online, hackers have their shopping scams ready.</p>\n<h2>The Human Element of Cybercrime</h2>\n<p>One aspect of cybercrime that deserves a fair share of attention is the human element. Crooks have always played on our feelings, fears, and misplaced senses of trust. It’s no different online, particularly during the holidays. We all know it can be a stressful time and that we sometimes give in to the pressure of finding that hard-to-get gift that’s so hot this year. Crooks know it, too, and they’ll tailor their attacks accordingly as we get wrapped up in the rush of the season.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/unwrapping-some-of-the-holiday-seasons-biggest-scams/\">Unwrapping Some of the Holiday Season’s Biggest Scams</a></p>\n<h2>Spotting Online Shopping Scams</h2>\n<p>As you hone your skills in recognizing fantastic bargains every Black Friday, it’s equally crucial to familiarize yourself and your family with techniques to detect online shopping scams. Safeguarding your financial well-being during this shopping season requires a combination of savvy shopping and vigilance. Here are some key strategies to help you steer clear of potential online scams:</p>\n<h3>Email attachments that pretend to be from legitimate retailers and shippers</h3>\n<p>A standard scam hackers use is introducing malware via email attachments, and during the holiday sale season, they’ll often send malware under the guise of offering emails and shipping notifications. Know that retailers and shipping companies won’t send things like offers, promo codes, and tracking numbers in attachments. They’ll call those things out in the body of an email instead.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/\">Phishing Email Examples: How to Recognize a Phishing Email</a></p>\n<h3>Typosquat trickery</h3>\n<p>A classic scammer move is to “<a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-typosquatting/\">typosquat</a>” phony email addresses and URLs that look close to legitimate addresses of legitimate companies and retailers. They often appear in phishing emails, and instead of leading you to a great deal, these can, in fact, link you to scam sites that can then lift your login credentials, payment info, or even funds should you try to place an order through them. You can avoid these sites by going to the retailer’s site directly. Be skeptical of any links you receive by email, text, or direct message—it’s best to go to the site yourself by manually typing in the legitimate address yourself and looking for the deal there.</p>\n<h3>Copycat deals and sites</h3>\n<p>A related scammer trick that also uses typosquatting tactics is to set up sites that look like a trusted retailer or brand could run them but are not. These sites may tout a special offer, a great deal on a hot holiday item, or whatnot, yet such sites are one more way cybercriminals harvest personal and financial information. A common way for these sites to spread is by social media, email, and other messaging platforms. Again, a “close to the real thing” URL is a telltale sign of a copycat, so visit retailers directly.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\">comprehensive online protection software</a> can prevent your browser from loading suspicious sites and warn you of suspicious sites in your search results. Alternatively, a safe browsing software like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html\">McAfee WebAdvisor</a> can also add an extra layer of security to your browsing experience.</p>\n<h3>Counterfeit Shopping Apps</h3>\n<p>Not every app that you’ll find on your mobile store is legitimate. Some are slyly designed to imitate trusted brands, but in reality, they are there to feed off your personal and financial information. These counterfeit apps can appear professional, which makes them hard to detect. To prevent falling into this kind of scam, it is advisable to use the app link from the retailer’s website. Visit the website using your mobile browser and search for a link to their app on the website. When using Safari on iOS, if the website has an app available, you’ll see a prompt at the top that gives you the option to either open the page in the app or download it if it’s not already on your device.</p>\n<p>Moreover, be careful and only download apps from legitimate app stores like Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures to prevent malicious apps. However, some manage to sneak in before they are detected. In this case, check for the publisher’s name and make sure it is the actual retailer you’re looking for. Other indicators of a fake app include typos, poor grammar, and imperfect design.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Review a report concerning your app’s access to your personal information to enable informed decision-making for each app. Explore this </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/beware-of-malicious-mobile-apps/\"><i>blog</i></a><i> for insights on preventing malicious apps.</i></p>\n<h3>The “Too Good to Be True” Offer</h3>\n<p>The holiday season is a critical time for shopping. Retailers have special offers for a limited time and popular holiday items that are difficult to find, which creates a sense of scarcity. This makes it the perfect time for scammers to launch their schemes. They leverage this urgency and create “too good to be true” offers on their fake sites. If the price, availability, or delivery time seems too advantageous, it might be a scam designed to steal your personal data and money. Therefore, be cautious before you click on any link.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure about an offer or a retailer, take a moment to check their reviews on trusted websites. This can help you discern whether it’s a legitimate deal or a scam. Do not rush into buying an item without doing proper research. Remember, if it is too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/online-shopping-festivals-things-clicking-add-cart/\">Online Shopping Festivals – Things to Do Before Clicking on Add to Cart</a></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The holiday season is a prime time for online shopping scams. Cybercriminals know that people are in a rush to get the best deals, and they take advantage of this. They use tactics like malware-laden email attachments, typosquatting, counterfeit sites, and apps, and unbelievable offers to trick unsuspecting shoppers. However, by being aware of these schemes and knowing how to spot them, you can protect yourself and ensure a safer online shopping experience.</p>\n<p>One key takeaway is to always double-check before clicking on any link or making a purchase. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Remember to download a trusted protection software like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer/mcafee-deals.html\">McAfee+</a> to give you an extra layer of security. It is advisable to use credit cards instead of debit cards while shopping online and consider using virtual credit cards for further protection. Finally, never give in to stress and scarcity. Take your time to make informed decisions and enjoy a safe shopping season.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/spot-those-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-shopping-scams/\">Spot Those Black Friday and Cyber Monday Shopping Scams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Benefits of Protection – How Organizations Gain from Digital Wellness","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-how-organizations-gain-from-digital-wellness/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 18:18:55 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=176939"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_111623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_111623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/300x200_Blog_111623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>This is the final in a series of three articles covering digital wellness programs in the workplace.

We reached out to nearly 250 HR pros who are knowledgeable about </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">benefits, data privacy, and cybersecurity in organizations of 1,000 employees or more. Across the board, they said digital wellness plays an important role in their organization for several reasons. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Collectively, they said it’s effective or highly effective at enhancing security (94%), retaining employees (87%), and improving employee safety and wellbeing (86%).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Moreover, 96% of them say that digital wellness in the workplace is more important than ever. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177000\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2.png 706w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2-300x187.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Image2-205x127.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With that, we also gained a sense as to deeply rooted remote and hybrid work have become. We found that 71% of organizations have at least a quarter of their workforce working remotely at least some of the time. Given that <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-why-employees-place-a-high-value-on-digital-wellness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1 in 2 employees worldwide use at least one personal device for work</a>, it makes sense that HR pros have prioritized digital wellness in their organizations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet what does a digital wellness benefit entail?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Building out a strong digital wellness benefit.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As shared in our earlier article, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-the-case-for-digital-wellness-in-the-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we found little consistency between digital wellness offerings</a>. The most common initiative HR pros employ is offering antivirus software, yet even that was reported by only 60% of organizations. The list breaks down as follows from there:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-177016\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3.png 586w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-271x300.png 271w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image3-116x129.png 116w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">One item on this list particularly stands out. Note how educating employees about phishing scams ranks so low, at 48%. Compare that to the 61% of HR pros who said that human error, such as falling victim to a phishing attack, led to a cybersecurity breach. From there, more than half said that breach led to a financial loss. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, which of the above provides the underpinnings of a strong digital wellness benefit? The answer to that is “yes to all.” And more.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When it comes to digital wellness, it’s easy to think of things like antivirus, a VPN, and other technology-driven solutions. Certainly, it’s that. Yet it’s much more. A strong digital wellness offering protects more than devices and things. It protects people. Because people are human, and human error can lead to security issues.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Organizations have IT teams tasked with securing networks, data, and devices. They put protections and policies in place to protect technology. To some extent, they factor in the human element as well. Yet to fully factor in the human element, that calls for HR to partner with IT. Together they can build out a digital wellness benefit that complements the protections IT puts in place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Building out a strong digital wellness benefit.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Organizations can often roll out digital wellness initiatives at relatively low cost, yet they require support to get them started. That begins by making the case for digital wellness benefits with leadership. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Throughout this series of articles, we uncovered how the post-pandemic world has transformed the way employees use the internet, the importance they place on digital wellness, and the reasons they welcome it as a benefit.

These topics could be about enhancing their privacy, staying fit with activities like Pilates or yoga, or even finding new people to talk to. So, companies create mobile applications to make it more convenient for users and advertise these apps on their websites. But is it safe to download these advertised applications through website searches?</p>\n<p>McAfee Mobile Research Team recently observed a malicious Android and iOS information stealer application delivered via phishing sites. This malware became active in early October and has been observed installed on more than 200 devices, according to McAfee&#8217;s telemetry. All of these devices are located in South Korea. Considering that all the distribution phishing sites are active at the time of writing this blog post, it is expected that the number of affected devices will continue to increase.</p>\n<p>The malware author selects a service that people might find interesting and attracts victims by disguising their service. They also create phishing sites that use the resources of legitimate sites, making them appear identical and tricking users into thinking that they are the official website of the application they want to install. The phishing site also provides Android and iOS versions of the malicious application. When users eventually download and run the app through this phishing site, their contact information and SMS messages are sent to the malware author. McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/SpyAgent.

After we found this malware and confirmed that it was targeting South Korea, we suspected it was also distributed through a phishing campaign. So we researched several communities in Korea. One of them, called Arca Live, we were able to confirm their exact distribution method.</p>\n<p>They initially approach victims via SMS message. At this stage, the scammers pretend to be women and send seductive messages with photos. After a bit of conversation, they try to move the stage to LINE messenger. After moving to LINE Messenger, the scammer becomes more aggressive. They send victims a link to make a video call and said that it should only be done using an app that prevents capture. That link is a phishing site where malicious apps will be downloaded.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-176339\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-251x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-251x300.png 251w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-857x1024.png 857w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-768x918.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-1285x1536.png 1285w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-1713x2048.png 1713w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1-108x129.png 108w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-1.png 1872w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-176353\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-155x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-155x300.png 155w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-528x1024.png 528w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-768x1489.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-792x1536.png 792w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2-67x129.png 67w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Figure1-2.png 990w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></p>\n<p>Figure 1.

Some iPhone users want to download apps through 3rd party stores rather than Apple App Store. There are many types of stores and tools on the Internet, but one of them is called Scarlet. The store shares enterprise certificates, making it easy for developers or crackers who want to use the store to share their apps with users.

Sensitive data stolen by malware (iOS)</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br />\n</strong>The focus of this ongoing campaign is targeting South Korea and there are 10 phishing sites discovered so far. This campaign can potentially be used for other malicious purposes since it steals the victim&#8217;s phone number, associated contacts, and SMS messages. So, users should consider all potential threats related to this, as the data targeted by the malware author is clear, and changes can be made to the known aspects so far.</p>\n<p>Users should remain cautious, even if they believe they are on an official website. If the app installation does not occur through Google Play Store or Apple App Store, suspicion is warranted. Furthermore, users should always verify when the app requests permissions that seem unrelated to its intended purpose. Because it is difficult for users to actively deal with all these threats, we strongly recommend that users should install security software on their devices and always keep up to date.

Worldwide, 80% or more of employees said that online protection was important or very important to them. Based on what we saw in <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-benefits-of-protection-the-case-for-digital-wellness-in-the-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our previous article</a> in the series, that comes as little surprise.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There, we covered how much time they spend online. Nearly </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">seven</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> hours a day on average. What’s more, they’re spending more time doing more important things. They’re managing their finances, doing their shopping, tracking their health, and even visiting their doctors online. And at historically high rates that only continue to climb.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet with that increased activity has come increased risk. Our research found that 27% of employees worldwide said they were a victim of cybercrime. A mix of data theft, malware, phishing, and targeted spearphishing attacks led the way. Strikingly, more than half of employees in the U.S. reported the theft of sensitive </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">info</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (54%).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Of note for organizations, our research found that 1 in 2 employees use one or more personal devices for work as well. Most often that was an Android (60%) or Windows (55%) device. iOS devices featured prominently as well at 33%.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This makes a strong case for offering comprehensive online protection as part of a digital wellness program. Employers gain the confidence that their employees are protected regardless of which device they use. Employees gain the protection they want, and need, to stay safe online in the workplace and across their daily lives. Both benefit.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Everyone benefits from online protection.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just as organizations have protection measures in place to protect employees on business devices, comprehensive online protection does the same for their personal devices. In this way, organizations gain the assurance that their employees are </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">protected</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> across practically every device they use, wherever they use them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, what does comprehensive protection look like?</span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Comprehensive online protection like ours goes beyond antivirus</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

That puts it in close association with other core benefits. In India, Brazil, and Australia, online protection is closely </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">linked</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with healthcare and paid leave. In the U.S. and European countries, 2 in 5 employees consider online digital protection tied to core employee benefits such as paid leave and bonuses.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Employees broadly acknowledged that this kind of protection benefits their employers as well.

Online protection can reduce those risks significantly. It helps prevent cyberattacks that can rob employees of their time and money as they attempt to recover from an attack. And it provides a clear path forward with restorative measures in the event of a data breach or identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Aside from offering a benefit that employees highly value, organizations can realize benefits of their own when they offer comprehensive online protection. They’ll have employees who’re unburdened and undistracted from disruptive attacks. Moreover, they’ll extend protections to personal devices that their employees use. Devices that half of them use for work and personal purposes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In our next article, we’ll help you make the business case for online protection and digital wellness programs from an organizational standpoint.

Here we take a broad look at today’s online trends — and reveal why digital wellness is now just as vital as physical, mental, and financial wellness programs.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What once got done in person, now gets done online. And at historic levels.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">There’s no question that the pandemic transformed face-to-face interactions into face-to-screen interactions. Not to mention that it ushered in the advent of remote work on a massive scale. Yet even with the pandemic behind us and people largely returning to their places of work, that transformation remains squarely in place. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Today, we conduct more of our lives online than ever before. That makes protecting life online more important than ever before. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet in a time of data breaches, identity theft, and online scams of all stripes, online protection can seem complicated. That’s why employees welcome digital wellness as a benefit. It can help them fix weak spots in their security, protect their privacy, and put them in control of their personal data. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Simply put, employees welcome the help.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our research with Statista found that 54% of employees worldwide said that online protection is an important or very important benefit.

Projections estimate that more than 3.5 billion people worldwide will bank online by 2024, driven in large part by online-only banks</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Global </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">e-commerce</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sales continue to climb with revenues topping more than $5.7 trillion in U.S. dollars. That growth continues at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.34%</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And that’s just for starters.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Increasingly, we track our health and wellness with connected devices too — like workouts on our </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">phones</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and biometrics on wearable devices. Worldwide, people own more than a billion wearable connected devices</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Taking that a step further, we visit the doctor online now as well. The old-fashioned house call has become the modern-day Zoom call. Our recent research found that 75% of people surveyed in early 2023 said they’ve used telehealth services in the past year</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In all, we trust the internet with some of our most important tasks. We even trust our homes to it. More than 300 million households run their day with the assistance of smart devices, like smart speakers, smart appliances, and smart deadbolt locks</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, we can point to the complicat</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ed</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> factor of remote and hybrid work. Our joint research with HR.com found that 98% of organizations surveyed have at least one or more employees who work remotely. Additional research cited by </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Forbes </span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">indicates that nearly 13% of full-time employees work remotely, while more than 28% work in a hybrid model</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. As a result, work devices inevitably get used for some personal purposes</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">—</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">just as personal devices get used for some professional purposes. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That adds up to an average of nearly seven hours a day spent online</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s little wonder that so many companies continue to show growing interest in digital wellness programs. People find themselves exposed to plenty of risk as they conduct personal business and professional business across the devices they use throughout the day. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, what </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">makes up</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> digital wellness and what it offers remains loosely defined.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The advent of digital wellness in the workplace</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Where do digital wellness programs stand in the workplace today? They share much with the state of financial wellness programs about ten years ago.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At the time, financial wellness was largely unknown. Further, companies were unsure if or how it played a part underneath the umbrella of “wellbeing.” Then changes came along. People saw how financial activities and planning can have a major impact on a person’s quality of life. Today, financial wellness is just as concrete as physical and mental wellness as benefits in the workplace.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Digital wellness now finds itself in the same evolution cycle that financial wellness entered a decade ago. It’s a concrete pillar underneath “wellbeing” much for the same reasons financial wellness is. Digital wellness reduces stress from loss or the unknown and </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">enables</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> richer, safer, and happier lives.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With that, </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">today’s threats have evolved as well. While viruses and malware remain a problem, today’s bad actors are out for bigger game</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">s</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Like stealing personal and financial info for identity theft.

Fraudsters have used AI as the capstone of convincing voice, image, and video scams. Hackers now generate malware code using AI tools as well. Combine that with the multitude of ways people spend their time online, it’s clear why today’s online crooks tamper with people’s data, privacy, and identity at unprecedented rates. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">HR professionals at organizations are aware of this. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Given this climate, 55% of HR professionals said they provide it as part of their organization’s core benefits offerings. Another 36% say it’s part of their organization’s voluntary benefits offerings. Yet their offerings vary greatly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our research respondents said that they have five different digital wellness initiatives on average. Yet we found little consistency between them. Only 60% of respondents provided the same initiatives. The top responses: antivirus software, personal data cleanup, protection for work devices, and instruction on digital best practices. This illustrates that digital wellness programs are indeed in those early stages of development. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What does digital wellness truly entail?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Digital wellness protects the person.

It helps prevent the things that can absolutely upend a person’s life online, like hacks, malware attacks, and online scams.

Yet if not looked after, gaps in their digital wellness can drive huge financial and mental stresses. For example, consider how identity theft steals more than money. It steals time, robbing a victim of their focus on other parts of their home and work lives as they struggle to recover.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As such, a digital wellness program that provides preventative and restorative measures.

It can also entail a healthy relationship with the internet. Balancing time spent there with other aspects of life, which can help relieve stress and burnout as well.

Watch out for last-minute shopping scams that are targeted at people who leave their gift buying until deep in December. As with anything else, if it’s too good to be true, it probably is.

Phishing emails, when you take the time to inspect them, are usually easy to spot. The logos are often blurry and the tone of the message will seem “off.” Either it will sound very formal and impersonal or it will sound very informal and seem pushy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Phony order confirmations and tracking numbers</span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">During the holiday shopping season, your doorstep can be crowded with packages.

Similarly, phishers may also impersonate delivery services claiming that they’re (basically) holding your orders hostage until you pay up. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift card cracking</span></b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gift cards are a standby present for the people on your list who are difficult to buy for or for people you don’t know too well but want to get them a small something. Whether the gift card is worth $5 or $500, an online scammer can steal the entire value through two techniques: a brute force attack or phishing.

Just because a company advertises on social media doesn’t mean that it’s reputable. Before you click on any links to a “deal” sent to you via email or text, hover over the link to see where the URL takes you. If it’s a long URL that redirects to a website with a typo or somewhere completely different than what you’d expect, approach with caution. An “https” at the beginning of the URL doesn’t necessarily mean that the site is secure, but it’s a good indicator that it may be ok to proceed. If a deal seems too good to be true, move along.

But have you ever considered the dangers that might be lurking within public USB chargers? In a surprising revelation, researchers at Georgia Tech discovered that public iPhone chargers can be a conduit for malicious apps, posing a significant risk to your data security and privacy.</p>\n<h2>The Deceptive Dangers of Public iPhone Chargers</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/beware-of-malicious-mobile-apps/\">malicious apps</a> resulting from public iPhone chargers do not require any downloads or visits to the app store. These apps are installed on your iPhone via the compromised USB chargers. Once installed, they function like conventional malware, controlling your device and potentially accessing sensitive information such as banking login details. They can even intercept your phone calls and remotely control your device. The distinctive aspect of these threats is their delivery method—through seemingly innocuous iPhone chargers.</p>\n<p>Despite these alarming characteristics, the threat posed by these malicious apps is not widely recognized or understood. Many people continue to casually plug their iPhones into public USB ports casually, little knowing the potential danger they expose their devices to. In contrast to the common belief that devices locked with a PIN or passcode are safe, these malicious apps can still infiltrate your iPhone if it is unlocked even for a moment.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/how-safe-is-your-android-pin-code-a-new-robot-can-easily-break-in/\">How Safe Is Your Android PIN Code?</a></p>\n<h2>The Devious Mechanism of Infecting iPhones</h2>\n<p>How exactly do these malicious apps find their way into our iPhones? The scheme was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/31/researchers-demonstrate-how-to-install-iphone-malware-with-a-malicious-charger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demonstrated</a> by researchers from Georgia Tech, who managed to fool Apple&#8217;s security team with a dummy Facebook app containing a hidden malware code. Their experiment showed that when an iPhone connected to a compromised charger is unlocked, the faux Facebook app activates, allowing hackers to take control of the device remotely.</p>\n<p>These threats, often called &#8220;AutoRun&#8221; threats, can make calls, view passwords, alter settings, and perform other operations on your device without your knowledge. The alarming thing about them is that they start executing when a corrupted drive is plugged into a device. Clearly, this poses a unique and powerful threat to smartphones, tablets, PCs, and Macs alike. As our dependence on these devices grows, so does the urgency to understand and prevent such attacks.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/can-apple-macs-get-viruses/\">Can Apple Macs Get Viruses?</a></p>\n<h2>The Extent and Impact of the Threat</h2>\n<p>Though the AutoRun threat may sound like a plot straight out of a sci-fi movie, it is disturbingly real. This <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/mcafee-labs.html\">McAfee Threats Report</a> revealed that the prevalence of these attacks doubled in one year and continues to rise. Such an escalation underscores the need for increased awareness and caution concerning our device usage.</p>\n<p>While the threat experiment conducted by Georgia Tech researchers was staged, the potential for its execution by cybercriminals is very real. Cybercriminals are always looking for weak spots in security systems, and public USB chargers are proving to be one such vulnerability. This is made worse because not many people are aware of this weakness, making them easy targets for cybercriminals.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Stay informed about less conventional threats, such as malware that may lurk in unexpected places like chargers, by exploring the wealth of cyber resources available in McAfee&#8217;s extensive collection of resources. Dive into our informative </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/\"><i>blogs</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/cybersecurity-reports-and-guides.html\"><i>in-depth reports</i></a><i> to expand your awareness and understanding of these unconventional risks.</i></p>\n<h2>Apple&#8217;s Response and Recommendations</h2>\n<p>Apple responded promptly to the Georgia Tech experiment and released an update to raise a warning when connecting to unfamiliar USB chargers. However, this warning is often ignored and opens the device to potential threats. So, the safest preventive measure is to avoid using public charging stations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is advisable not to unlock your devices while charging. Unlocking an iPhone, even momentarily, was key to disseminating the malicious app in the Georgia Tech experiment. If you’ve connected to a public USB charger and want to verify that your device hasn’t been compromised, navigate to Settings &gt; General &gt; Profiles. If you see any unfamiliar names, remove them immediately.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/protecting-the-universal-remote-control-of-your-life-your-smartphone/\">Protecting the Universal Remote Control of Your Life—Your Smartphone</a></p>\n<h2>Further Protective Measures</h2>\n<p>Public charging stations might seem like a convenient solution, but they come with their own set of risks–malware is one, as mentioned. One of the most practical and secure alternatives to public charging stations is carrying a portable charger, commonly known as a power bank. These devices come in various sizes and capacities, making it easy to find one that suits your needs. Another simple yet effective alternative to public charging stations is to carry your own charging cable. Most people use USB cables that can be connected to power sources like laptops, portable chargers, or even wall outlets.</p>\n<p>Along with avoiding public charging stations, it is crucial only to download apps from trusted sources. While the malicious app in the experiment was installed via a compromised charger, caution is still paramount when downloading apps, even over Wi-Fi. Stick to official app stores to lessen the risk of downloading malware-laden apps.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant measure to protect against cyber threats is installing comprehensive security on all your devices.

The ever-evolving tactics of cybercriminals require vigilant and robust security measures.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>As our reliance on smartphones and other devices grows, so does the sophistication and prevalence of cyber threats. In this high-risk digital era, awareness and caution are the first steps toward protection. The experimental threat posed by public iPhone chargers underscores the hidden dangers we may unknowingly expose ourselves to. By understanding these threats and implementing protective measures, such as using trusted sources for app downloads and comprehensive security software, we can minimize our vulnerability to such attacks. As we continue to live in an increasingly digital world, it is more important than ever to understand potential threats and take steps to protect ourselves and our valuable data.</p>\n<p>Safeguarding your devices, especially those that are an integral part of your daily life and constantly require recharging, is paramount in our increasingly interconnected world. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html\">McAfee&#8217;s cutting-edge software solutions</a> offer a fortified defense against many online perils.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/public-iphone-chargers-malware/\">US-B Careful: Public iPhone Chargers Lie in Wait</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Cyber Monday: Protect Yourself and Your Family from Online Shopping Scams","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/cyber-monday-is-coming-10-tips-to-protect-you-from-online-shopping-scams/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 14:55:18 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Tips & Tricks"},{"#cdata-section":"Cyber Monday"},{"#cdata-section":"Shopping Scams"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=108121"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_051123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_051123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_051123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>The eagerly awaited holiday sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner.

As consumers, we look forward to getting the best deals online, but we&#8217;re not the only ones. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-hacker/\">Hackers</a> are also keenly anticipating these holidays but for different reasons. They use this period to come up with all sorts of shopping scams that can potentially put a dampener on the holiday spirit for unsuspecting shoppers.</p>\n<p>This article provides you with ten tips to keep you and your family safe from online shopping scams this season. These tips will not only help you spot a good deal but also help you avoid falling prey to online scams, thereby ensuring that you keep your finances safe during this shopping season.</p>\n<h2>1. Be Cautious of Email Attachments from Retailers and Shippers</h2>\n<p>A common tactic employed by hackers involves the use of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a> hidden in email attachments. During the holiday sales season, they often camouflage their malware in emails that claim to contain offers or shipping notifications. It is important to remember that legitimate retailers and shipping companies will not send offers, promo codes, or tracking numbers as email attachments. Instead, they will mention these details in the body of the email.</p>\n<p>Therefore, be wary of any email attachments you receive from retailers or shippers. If something seems off, it probably is. Do not download or open suspicious attachments, as this could potentially lead to a malware attack.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-protects-against-suspicious-email-attachments/\">McAfee Protects Against Suspicious Email Attachments</a></p>\n<h2>2. Thoroughly Review Links and Email Addresses</h2>\n<p>Scammers often employ a tactic known as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-is-typosquatting/\">typosquatting</a>,&#8221; where they create phony email addresses and URLs that look incredibly similar to the legitimate addresses of well-known companies and retailers. These are often sent via phishing emails, and instead of leading you to great deals, these links can direct you to scam websites that extract your login credentials, payment information, or even directly extract funds from your account when you attempt to place an order through them.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is imperative to double-check all email addresses and URLs before clicking on them. Look out for subtle discrepancies in the spelling or arrangement of characters, as these are often indicators of a scam. If a link or email address seems suspicious, do not click on it.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/typosquatting-need-know-now/\">How Typosquatting Scams Work</a></p>\n<h2>3. Beware of Copycat Deals and Sites</h2>\n<p>In continuation with the previous point, scammers also set up websites that resemble those run by trusted retailers or brands. These websites often advertise special offers or attractive deals on popular holiday items. However, these are nothing more than a ruse to trick unsuspecting shoppers into divulging their personal and financial information.</p>\n<p>These scam websites are often spread through social media, email, and other messaging platforms. It&#8217;s crucial to exercise skepticism when encountering such links. Instead of clicking on them, it&#8217;s always safer to visit the brand&#8217;s official website directly and look for the deal there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/8-ways-to-know-if-online-stores-are-safe-and-legit/\">8 Ways to Know If Online Stores Are Safe and Legit</a></p>\n<h2>4. Ensure You Have Adequate Protection While Shopping</h2>\n<p>Using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\">robust and comprehensive security software suite</a> while shopping can provide you with additional layers of protection against scams. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/web-protection/\">web browser protection</a> features can block malicious and suspicious links, reducing the risk of falling prey to malware or a financial scam.</p>\n<p>Ensure your <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">antivirus software</a> is up to date and your <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html\">firewall</a> is enabled. At the same time, enable secure browsing options available in your web browser. These simple steps can go a long way in securing your online shopping experience.</p>\n<h2>5. Diversify and Secure Your Passwords</h2>\n<p>Using the same passwords across multiple platforms is akin to giving hackers a free pass. If they manage to hack into one account, they can potentially gain access to others that share the same password. To avoid this, consider using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">password manager</a>. These tools can generate complex and unique passwords for each of your accounts and store them securely, saving you the hassle of remembering them all.</p>\n<p>By diversifying your passwords and securing them effectively, you can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a victim of a hack or a scam. The importance of this proactive approach cannot be overstated in today&#8217;s interconnected world, where our personal and financial information is often just a few clicks away from prying eyes and malicious intent.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/\">Strong Password Ideas to Keep Your Information Safe</a></p>\n<h2>6. Utilize Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">Two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> is an invaluable tool that adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts. When 2FA is enabled, gaining access to your accounts isn&#8217;t as simple as just entering your username and password. Instead, you also need to input a unique, one-time-use code that is typically sent to your phone or email. This code acts as a second password, making your account significantly more secure.</p>\n<p>If any of your accounts offer 2FA, it&#8217;s crucial to take advantage of this feature. While it might initially seem cumbersome, the added security is well worth the slight inconvenience.</p>\n<h2>7. Use a VPN When Shopping on Public Wi-Fi</h2>\n<p>Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in coffee shops and other public locations, can be dangerous due to their lack of security. If you shop online through a public Wi-Fi network, you&#8217;re essentially broadcasting your private information to anyone who cares to look. To prevent this, consider using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/vpn/\">virtual private network (VPN)</a>.</p>\n<p>VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, securing it against any prying eyes. This <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-encryption/\">encryption</a> protects your passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information from being intercepted and misused. If you frequently shop online in public places, using a VPN is a must.</p>\n<h2>8. Opt for Credit Cards Over Debit Cards</h2>\n<p>In the U.S., the Fair Credit Billing Act protects against fraudulent charges on credit cards. Under this act, you can dispute any charges over $50 for goods and services that you never received or were billed incorrectly for. Moreover, many credit card companies offer policies that add to the protections provided by the Fair Credit Billing Act.</p>\n<p>However, these protections don&#8217;t extend to debit cards. When you use a debit card, the money is immediately drawn from your bank account, making it more difficult to recover in case of fraud. So, for online shopping, it&#8217;s safer to use a credit card instead of a debit card.</p>\n<h2>9. Consider Getting a Virtual Credit Card</h2>\n<p>A virtual credit card can provide an extra layer of security for your online purchases. When you use one of these cards, it generates a temporary card number for each transaction, keeping your real card number safe. However, there are potential downsides to be aware of, such as difficulties with returns and refunds.</p>\n<p>Before deciding to use a virtual credit card, understand its pros and cons. Research the policies of the issuing company so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it&#8217;s the right choice for you.</p>\n<h2>10. Monitor Your Credit Reports Closely</h2>\n<p>Given the number of accounts most of us manage and the rampant incidents of data breaches, it&#8217;s crucial to monitor your credit reports for any signs of fraud. An unexpected change in your credit score could indicate that someone has taken out a loan or credit card in your name. If you notice any discrepancies, report them immediately to the credit bureau and to the lender who reported the fraudulent information.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., you&#8217;re entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every year. Utilize this service and check your reports regularly. Remember, quickly identifying and reporting fraudulent activity is the key to mitigating its impact.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>Have you encountered a suspicious charge on your credit card and felt uncertain about the next steps?

Unfortunately, the latter instances often become <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/top-online-scams-avoid/\">scams</a> run by fraudsters seeking to take advantage of the shopping frenzy. In this article, we will discuss some of the most notorious Black Friday and Cyber Monday scams that you should keep an eye out for.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Scams</h2>\n<p>Scammers are skilled manipulators who know how to twist human emotions to their advantage. They create a sense of urgency, fear, or stress, which are heightened during the holiday season rush. As people scramble to get the best deals and hard-to-get items, they often let their guard down, making them easy targets for these fraudsters. Knowing how to identify these scams is the first step to safeguarding yourself from becoming a victim.</p>\n<h2>Top Online Shopping Scams to Avoid</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned online shopper or just getting started, this guide will help you identify the top online shopping scams today and stay one step ahead to enjoy a safer, more secure shopping experience:</p>\n<h3>1. The Fake Order Scam</h3>\n<p>As everyone is hurrying to grab the best deals during the holiday season, keeping track of all the orders can be challenging. Scammers leverage this situation, sending fake order confirmations via email or text. These seemingly legit confirmations often contain <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-phishing/\">phishing</a> links that the scammers use to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\">steal your identity</a>. The best strategy is to track your orders directly from the seller&#8217;s website or platform.</p>\n<h3>2. The Phony Tracking Number Scam</h3>\n<p>Similar to the fake order scam, fraudsters send fake package tracking notifications as an email attachment or link. Actual retailers will never send tracking numbers via an attachment. Scammers use these tactics to infect your device with malware or direct you to phishing sites. As always, visit the seller&rsquo;s site to get accurate tracking information for your order.</p>\n<h3>3. The Bogus Website Scam</h3>\n<p>Scammers are skilled at creating fake email addresses and URLs that resemble those of legitimate companies. These phishing emails often lead to scam sites that capture your login credentials and payment information. Avoid clicking on email links; it&rsquo;s safer to type the URL manually and search for deals.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/7-ways-tell-fake/\">7 Ways to Tell If It&rsquo;s a Fake</a></p>\n<h3>4. The Hot Deal Scam</h3>\n<p>Scarcity is a prime tool for scammers. They create fake websites offering popular items that are generally hard to find. These scams can result in you paying for a product you&#8217;ll never receive and the scammer possessing your payment details. The Better Business Bureau provides useful reviews to help verify the legitimacy of a product or seller.</p>\n<h3>5. The Fake Charity Scam</h3>\n<p>During the holiday season, there&rsquo;s a surge in charity donations, and scammers know this trend. They set up bogus charities and employ high-pressure tactics to get you to donate. Be wary of organizations that accept payment only through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/how-donate-wisely-and-avoid-charity-scams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resources</a> to ensure your donations reach legitimate charities.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding Scams on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h2>\n<p>Amidst the whirlwind of savings and special offers, there&#8217;s a lurking concern that every savvy shopper should be aware of &ndash; scams. Protecting yourself from potential scams during these shopping bonanzas is paramount. Several strategies are available to help you stay one step ahead of potential scammers and ensure a safe and successful shopping experience during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Here are strategies you can follow:</p>\n<h3>Stick with known, legitimate retailers online</h3>\n<p>One of the simplest ways to avoid scammers is to shop from familiar and reputable online retailers. If you&#8217;re unsure about a retailer, the U.S. Better Business Bureau provides <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/8767-bbb-tips-10-steps-to-avoid-scams?__cf_chl_tk=A41q0BqWgHKYiC8muvF0WSlZLzgx01xbLy6hkt0icaw-1698234860-0-gaNycGzNDXs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listings</a> to help you research their reputation.</p>\n<h3>Look for the lock icon in your browser when you shop</h3>\n<p>Secure websites start with &#8220;https,&#8221; with the extra &#8220;s&#8221; standing for &#8220;secure.&#8221; You&rsquo;ll often see a padlock icon in the address bar of your browser. If you don&rsquo;t see these security indicators, avoid purchasing on that website.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>When you&#8217;re visiting a website, it&#8217;s important to keep your radar up for a few essential clues that tell you whether it&#8217;s safe or not. Sure, we&#8217;ve talked about the &#8216;https&#8217; thing in the web address, but there are other giveaways, too, like phony icons and symbols, how well the website&#8217;s put together, how fast it loads, and a bunch of other stuff. Want to know more about how to check out if a website&#8217;s the real deal or not? <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-if-website-is-safe/\">Check how to tell whether a website is safe.</a></i></p>\n<h2>6. The False Discount Scam</h2>\n<p>In this scam, fraudsters lure victims with advertisements offering significant discounts on popular products. These advertisements usually contain a link redirecting you to a fraudulent website where your personal and financial information gets stolen. Always cross-check the offered prices with those on the manufacturer&#8217;s or well-known retailers&#8217; websites. Also, check if the seller provides complete contact information. A lack of information or a recently registered website should raise a red flag.</p>\n<h3>7. The Social Media Gift Exchange Scam</h3>\n<p>During the holiday season, a gift exchange scam often resurfaces on social media. The concept is simple: you buy a gift worth a certain amount, typically $10, and supposedly receive several gifts in return. However, the only person who benefits is the scammer who initiated the scheme. This type of scam is not only deceptive but also illegal. If you encounter such a scheme on social media, report it immediately.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/social-media-protection/\">6 Tips for Protecting Your Social Media Accounts</a></p>\n<h3>8. The Fraudulent Gift Card Scam</h3>\n<p>Scammers love gift cards! They use emails or text messages to trick you into thinking you&#8217;ve received a gift card from a friend or family member. These messages often contain links that, when clicked, install malware on your device or steal your personal information. Always verify the source before clicking on any links. And remember, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<h3>9. The Non-existent E-tailer Scam</h3>\n<p>Beware of new e-commerce sites offering popular items at massive discounts. Scammers often create fake e-commerce sites that vanish after collecting money from their victims. Always research the seller&#8217;s reputation before making a purchase. If you can&#8217;t find any reviews or feedback about the seller, it&#8217;s better to avoid the risk.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/8-ways-to-know-if-online-stores-are-safe-and-legit/\">8 Ways to Know If Online Stores Are Safe and Legit</a></p>\n<h2>10. The Smishing Scam</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-smishing/\">Smishing</a> is a scam where fraudsters send text messages posing as reputable companies to trick individuals into revealing personal information. During the holiday season, these messages often link to a supposed deal or gift. However, the link usually leads to a fraudulent website designed to steal your data. Treat unsolicited print messages with caution, and never click on suspicious links.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While the holiday season brings joy and excitement, it also increases online shopping scams. Scammers use a variety of tactics, including fake order confirmations, phony tracking numbers, bogus websites, and nonexistent e-tailers, to trick their victims. To protect yourself, always verify the source before clicking on any links, research sellers before purchasing, and avoid deals that seem too good to be true. By being vigilant and taking precautions, you can safely navigate through the holiday shopping frenzy and prevent yourself from falling victim to these Black Friday and Cyber Monday scams.

Black Friday and Cyber Monday have practically become holidays themselves, as each year, they immediately shift our attention from turkey and pumpkin pie to holiday shopping. Let&rsquo;s look at these two holidays and how their popularity can impact users&rsquo; online security, and grab a great <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer/mcafee-deals.html\">Black Friday holiday deal</a> from McAfee.</p>\n<h2>About the Black Friday Shopping Phenomenon</h2>\n<p>You might be surprised that &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; was first associated with a financial crisis, not sales shopping. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/the-black-friday-gold-scandal-145-years-ago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The U.S. gold market crashed on Friday, September 24, 1869, leaving Wall Street bankrupt</a>. In the 1950s, Black Friday was associated with holiday shopping when large crowds of tourists and shoppers flocked to Philadelphia for a big football game. Because of all the chaos, traffic jams, and shoplifting opportunities that arose, police officers could not take the day off, coining it Black Friday. It wasn&rsquo;t until over 50 years later that Cyber Monday came to fruition when Shop.org coined the term as a way for online retailers to participate in the Black Friday shopping frenzy.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the origins of &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; are indeed surprising and far removed from the image of holiday shopping extravaganzas that we associate with the term today. These historical roots offer a fascinating perspective on the evolution of consumer culture and the significance of these shopping events in modern times.</p>\n<h2>Growth Over the Years</h2>\n<p>Since the origination of these two massive shopping holidays, both have seen incredible growth. Global interest in Black Friday has risen year-over-year, with 117% average growth across the last five years. According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/11/26/black-friday-cyber-monday-sales-are-hitting-another-high-but-its-not-time-to-cheer-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes</a>, 2018&rsquo;s Black Friday brought in $6.2 billion in online sales alone, while Cyber Monday brought in a record $7.9 billion.</p>\n<p>While foot traffic seemed to decrease at brick-and-mortar stores during Cyber Week 2018, more shoppers turned their attention to the Internet to participate in holiday bargain hunting. Throughout this week, sales derived from desktop devices came in at 47%, while mobile purchases made up 45% of revenue and tablet purchases made up 8% of revenue.</p>\n<p>So, what does this mean for Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping this holiday season? In 2023, Adobe Analytics <a href=\"https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-Forecasts-221.8-Billion-U.S.-Holiday-Season-Online-Cyber-Monday-To-Top-12-Billion-default.aspx/default.aspx\">anticipates</a> that Cyber Monday will maintain its status as the most significant shopping day of the season and the year, spurring a historic $12 billion in spending, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.1%. Online sales on Black Friday are expected to increase by 5.7% year over year, reaching $9.6 billion, while Thanksgiving is projected to grow by 5.5% year over year, amounting to $5.6 billion in spending.</p>\n<p>If one thing&rsquo;s for sure, this year&rsquo;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales are shaping up to be the biggest ones for shoppers looking to snag some seasonal bargains. However, the uptick in online shopping activity provides cybercriminals the perfect opportunity to wreak havoc on users&rsquo; holiday fun, potentially disrupting users&rsquo; festive experiences and compromising their online security. In light of this, it is crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your digital presence. One effective way to do so is by investing in top-tier online protection solutions. McAfee, a renowned leader in the field, offers award-winning cybersecurity solutions designed to shield you from the ever-evolving threats in the digital landscape.

One common form of scam you&rsquo;ll come across during this time is fraudulent websites. These sites masquerade as reputable online retailers, luring customers with too-good-to-be-true deals. Once shoppers enter their personal and financial data, the criminals behind these sites gain access to the sensitive information, paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-identity-theft/\">identity theft</a>.</p>\n<p>Phishing emails are another popular mode of scam during these shopping holidays. Shoppers receive emails that appear to be from legitimate stores advertising incredible deals. The emails typically contain links that direct users to a fraudulent website where their information can be stolen. It&rsquo;s essential to approach every email suspiciously, checking the sender&rsquo;s information and avoiding clicking on unsolicited links.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-protect-yourself-from-phishing-scams/\">How to Protect Yourself From Phishing Scams</a></p>\n<h2>How to Protect Yourself from These Scams</h2>\n<p>Thankfully, there are steps you can take to protect yourself when shopping online during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. First, always ensure that the website you&rsquo;re shopping from is legitimate. Check for the padlock icon in the address bar and &ldquo;https&rdquo; in the URL, as these are indicators of a secure site. Steer clear of websites that lack these security features or have misspelled domain names, as they could be fraudulent.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>When browsing a website, there are several essential cues to consider when assessing its safety. As mentioned, one such indicator is the presence of &ldquo;https&rdquo; in the website&rsquo;s URL. But there are also other tell-tale signs, such as fake lock icons, web copy, web speed, and more. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-if-website-is-safe/\">Know how to tell whether a website is safe.</a></i></p>\n<p>Furthermore, never provide personal or financial information in response to an unsolicited email, even if it appears to be from a trusted source. If the offer seems tempting, visit the retailer&rsquo;s official website and check if the same deal is available there. Finally, consider installing a reputable <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">antivirus</a> and security software, like McAfee, that can provide real-time protection and alert you when you stumble upon a malicious website or receive a phishing email.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are prime opportunities for consumers to snag once-a-year deals and for cybercriminals to exploit their eagerness to save. However, being aware of the prevalent scams and knowing how to protect yourself can save you from falling prey to these ploys.

Why the cold feet? The buyer wanted to speak to Michel on the phone to confirm that Michel was a real person. “Are you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">OK</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> if I voice call you from Google?” Michel agreed, sent her number, and soon received a text with a Google Voice code. The buyer asked for the code, and as soon as Michel sent it, she got that sinking feeling. “I should have Googled before I did, because something feels really off.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As she found out, it was.

Here, scammers send a text message with a Google Voice verification code and ask you to send them that code. With it, they can create a Google Voice number linked to your phone number—and go on to commit other forms of identity theft in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It happens so often that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has </span><a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2021/10/google-voice-scam-how-verification-code-scam-works-and-how-avoid-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">a page dedicated to the topic</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

This practice allows you to explain and discuss what&#8217;s happening and address any questions or concerns your child may have in real-time.</span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Empathy and Compassion:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Foster discussions about the importance of </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/5-digitally-rich-terms-to-define-and-discuss-with-your-kids/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">empathy and compassion</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for those suffering due to conflicts. Encourage your child to engage in activities that promote understanding and kindness.</span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Review Reporting Channels:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> If your child is online be sure they know how to report disturbing or inappropriate content on their favorite apps, games, or social sites. Most platforms have mechanisms for flagging or reporting such content, which empowers </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">children</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">to be active participants in online safety.</span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Seek Professional Support if Needed:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> What’s happening in the world is distressing and can ignite confusion, fear, and anxiety in a child. Every child is unique so if you notice signs of distress, anxiety, or trauma due to exposure to violent online content, don&#8217;t hesitate to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. Their expertise can be invaluable in times of need.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To wrap up, don&#8217;t </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">lose sight of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">mental and physical well-being </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">by implementing the strategies mentioned here. By setting a strong example of a balanced digital life and open communication about real-life crises, your children will naturally pick up on how to navigate the online world. Your actions speak volumes, and they will follow your lead.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/digital-strategies-to-safeguard-your-child-from-upsetting-and-violent-content-online/\">Digital Strategies to Safeguard Your Child from Upsetting and Violent Content Online</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"User Data from 23andMe Leaked Online – What Users Should Do, and the Rest of Us Too","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/security-news/user-data-from-23andme-leaked-online-what-users-should-do-and-the-rest-of-us/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 12 Oct 2023 19:34:06 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Security News"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175445"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>A hacker claims to have hijacked profile information of “millions” of users from the popular genetic testing site 23andMe.com.   What’s...</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/security-news/user-data-from-23andme-leaked-online-what-users-should-do-and-the-rest-of-us/\">User Data from 23andMe Leaked Online – What Users Should Do, and the Rest of Us Too</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_23andMe-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">A hacker claims to have hijacked profile information of “millions” of users from the popular genetic testing site 23andMe.com. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What’s at risk?

However, changing passwords is not enough. Every password must be strong and unique. For every account. If that sounds like a task, </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">a password manager can help</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">. It creates strong, unique passwords—and stores them securely. This way, you can avoid falling victim to attacks where bad actors try to use passwords stolen from one account to break into another. That’s the beauty of no-repeat passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Use multi-factor authentication (MFA):</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Many online accounts offer MFA, also known as 2-factor authentication or 2FA. It adds an extra step to the login process, such as sending a six-digit code to your phone with a call or text. If your accounts support this, use it. It makes it far more difficult for hackers to break into your account—even if they end up with your password. Also, never provide an authentication number to anyone else. It’s yours, and yours alone. Treat it like the secret code it is. </span><a href=\"https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034119874-Adding-2-Step-Verification-to-Your-23andMe-Account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Specific to 23andMe users, you can enable MFA with the instructions on this page</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Monitor your identity, credit, and transactions:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> In the wake of any attack where your personal info might be at risk, keep an eye on all things you. Your bank accounts, credit cards, online finances, and your credit rating. Hackers view personal info as a gold mine. Rightly so.

Which is pretty much all of us. It makes one of the strongest cases for strong, unique passwords—and for limiting the info you share online.

Yes, that’s a lot to consider. Complicating that yet more, many of the sites, services, and apps we use don’t make it easy to answer those questions.

That’s how things go in a cryptojacking attack.</p>\n<p>Cryptomining is the utilization of computers to run processor-intensive computations to acquire cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking involves hijacking a device and using it to mine cryptocurrency for profit. It’s a form of malware that saps your device’s resources, making it run sluggish and potentially overheating it as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the hackers behind those attacks generate cryptocurrency by hijacking your device and thousands of others like it. Together they create virtual illicit networks that turn them a profit.</p>\n<p>However, you can absolutely prevent it from happening to you. That starts with a closer look at who’s behind it and how they pull it off.</p>\n<h2><strong>How cryptojacking works.</strong></h2>\n<p>What lures hackers to cryptojacking? It’s big business. Gone are the early days when practically anyone with a standard computer could participate in the cryptomining process. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/blockchain-basics-whats-blockchain-technology-and-how-might-it-change-our-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proverbial field is flooded with miners competing against each other</a> to solve the cryptographic puzzles that earn a cryptocurrency reward. Profitable miners run farms of dedicated mining rigs that cost thousands of dollars each.</p>\n<p>Visualize row after row of racks after racks stacked with mining rigs in hyper-cooled warehouses. That’s what industrialized cryptomining looks like nowadays.</p>\n<p>To put it all into perspective, <a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nber.org.mcas.ms%2Fpapers%2Fw29396%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one study estimated</a> that “(t)he top 10% of [Bitcoin] miners control 90% and just 0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50% of mining capacity.” That makes cryptomining a difficult field to break into. And that’s why some people cheat.</p>\n<p>Enter the cryptojackers. These hackers forgo the massive up-front and ongoing costs of a cryptomining farm. Instead, they build their cryptomining operations off the backs of other people by hijacking or “cryptojacking” their devices. In doing so, they leach the computing resources of others to mine their cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Cryptojackers will target just about anyone—individuals, companies, and governmental agencies. They’ll infiltrate phones, laptops, and desktops. In larger instances, they’ll go after large server farms or an organization’s cloud infrastructure. This way, they get the computing power they need. Illegally.</p>\n<p>As to how cryptojackers pull that off, they have a couple of primary options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malware-based delivery</strong>, where a victim’s device gets infected with cryptojacking code through a phishing attack or by installing an app laced with cryptomining</li>\n<li><strong>Browser-based delivery</strong>, where cryptojackers compromise a victim’s browser while they visit a site that hosts cryptomining code. Sometimes cryptojackers create malicious sites for this specific purpose. In other instances, they infect otherwise legitimate sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What can that look like in the real world? We’ve seen <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android phones harnessed for cryptomining</a> after downloading malicious apps from Google Play. Cryptojackers have created <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/96763-beware-fake-msi-afterburner-installs-cryptojacking-information-stealing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counterfeit versions of popular computer performance software</a> and infected it with cryptojacking code. We’ve also seen cryptojackers tap into the computing power of <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rapperbot-ddos-malware-adds-cryptojacking-as-new-revenue-stream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices as well</a>.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the rate of cryptojacking attacks is closely tied to the vagaries of the marketplace. As the value of cryptocurrencies rise and fall, so does cryptojacking. The crooks behind these hacks go where they get the biggest bang for their buck. So as cryptocurrencies drop in value, these crooks drop their cryptojacking attacks. They opt for other attacks that offer a higher return on the resources they invest.</p>\n<p>Despite its cyclic nature, cryptojacking remains a stubborn problem. Yet you can do plenty to prevent it from happening to you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Three ways you can prevent cryptojacking.</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stick to legitimate app stores: </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure, third-party sites might very well not. Further, some third-party sites might intentionally host malicious apps as part of a broader scam.</p>\n<p>Granted, hackers have found ways to work around Google and Apple’s review process, yet the chances of downloading a safe app from them are far greater than anywhere else. Further, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps when discovered, making their stores that much safer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use online protection software:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comprehensive online protection software</a> like ours can protect you in several ways. First, our AI-powered antivirus detects, blocks, and removes malware—new and old. This can protect you against the latest cryptojacking attacks. Further, it includes web protection that blocks malicious sites, such as the ones that host web-based cryptojacking attacks. In all, comprehensive online protection software offers a strong line of defense.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protect yourself from phishing and smishing attacks:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether cryptojackers try to reach you by email (phishing) or text (smishing), our new <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/scamprotection?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee Scam Protection</a> can stop those attacks dead in their tracks. Using the power of AI, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/scamprotection?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee Scam Protection</a> can alert you when scam texts pop up on your device or phone. No more guessing if a text is real or not. Further, it can block risky sites if you accidentally follow a scam link in a text, email, social media, and more.</p>\n<h2><strong>Keep cryptojackers from making a fast buck off you.</strong></h2>\n<p>While hackers love pilfering the computing resources of large organizations, their cryptojacking attacks still target everyday folks. Just as is the case with ransomware, hackers will seek to make their money in volume. Targeting under-protected households can still reap plenty of cryptocurrency when hackers do so in numbers.</p>\n<p>Protecting yourself is relatively easy. Several of the same general steps you take to protect yourself online offer protection from cryptojacking attacks as well. Stick to legitimate app stores, use the tools that can quash spammy emails and texts, and go online confidently with online protection software. Nobody should make a fast buck off you. Particularly a cryptojacker.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cryptojacking-stop-hackers-from-making-money-off-you/\">Cryptojacking – Stop Hackers from Making Money Off You</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence and Winning the Battle Against Deepfakes and Malware","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/artificial-intelligence-and-winning-the-battle-against-deepfakes-and-malware/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Jasdev Dhaliwal"},"pubDate":"Tue, 03 Oct 2023 15:00:00 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=173100"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_091223-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>As AI deepfakes and malware understandably grab the headlines, one thing gets easily overlooked—AI also works on your side.

Likewise, just as legitimate application developers use AI to create code, hackers use AI to create malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There’s no question that all these AI-driven scams mark a major change in the way we stay safe online.

By analyzing the behavior of files for patterns that are consistent with malware behavior, it can prevent a previously unknown file or process from doing harm.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"><br />\n</span></li>\n<li><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:105,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It further detects threats by referencing known malware signatures and behaviors.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> This combats zero-day and pre-existing threats alike. AI can spot zero-day threats by comparing them to malware fingerprints and behaviors it has learned.

The more threats it encounters, the more rapidly and readily it can determine if files are malicious or benign. Furthermore, AI automatically classifies threats at a speed and scale unmatched by traditional processes. The body of threat intelligence improves immensely as a result. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What does AI-driven protection look like for you? It can identify malicious websites before you can connect to them. It can prevent new forms of ransomware from encrypting your photos and files.

Advances in AI give images a clarity and crispness that they didn’t have before, deepfake videos play more smoothly, and voice cloning gets uncannily accurate.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet even with the best AI, scammers often leave their fingerprints all over the fake news content they create. Look for the following: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) Consider the context  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI fakes usually don’t appear by themselves. There’s often text or a larger article around them. Inspect the text for typos, poor grammar, and overall poor composition. Look to see if the text even makes sense. And like legitimate news articles, does it include identifying information — like date, time, and place of publication, along with the author’s name.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Evaluate the claim </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does the image seem too bizarre to be real? Too good to be true? Today, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet,” now includes “Don’t believe everything you see on the internet.” If a fake news story is claiming to be real, search for the headline elsewhere. If it’s truly noteworthy, other known and reputable sites will report on the event—and have done their own fact-checking. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3) Check for distortions </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The bulk of AI technology still renders fingers and hands poorly. It often creates eyes that might have a soulless or dead look to them — or that show irregularities between them. Also, shadows might appear in places where they look unnatural. Further, the skin tone might look uneven. In deepfaked videos, the voice and facial expressions might not exactly line up, making the subject look robotic and stiff.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI is on your side in this new era of online protection.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The battle between hackers and the people behind online protection continues. And while the introduction of AI has unleashed all manner of new attacks, the pattern prevails. Hackers and security professionals tap into the same technologies and continually up the game against each other.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Understandably, AI conjures questions, uncertainty, and, arguably, fear.

Many times, it takes common sense and a sharp eye to spot a hustle when you see one. If anything, that remains one instance where humans still have a leg up on AI. Humans have gut instincts. They can sense when something looks, feels, or sounds …off. Rely on that instinct. And give yourself time to let it speak to you. In a time of AI-driven fakery, it still stands as an excellent first line of defense.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/artificial-intelligence-and-winning-the-battle-against-deepfakes-and-malware/\">Artificial Intelligence and Winning the Battle Against Deepfakes and Malware</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How much do you count on the internet every day?","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cybersecurity-awareness-month/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 15:58:15 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity awareness Month"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175226"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/300x200_Blog_100123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Maybe you do armloads of shopping on it.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130224005140/en/McAfee-Reveals-Consumers-Fail-to-Protect-Their-Mobile-Devces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global survey</a> by McAfee and One Poll, many consumers are largely unconcerned about the security of their personal data stored on mobile devices. To illustrate, only one in five respondents had backed up data on their tablet or smartphone. Even more concerning, 15% admitted they saved password information on their phone.</p>\n<p>Such statistics are troubling for several reasons. The most obvious is the risk of personal information —including banking details and online login credentials— falling into the wrong hands. A lost or stolen device is not just a device lost— it&#8217;s potentially an identity, a bank account, or worse. The lack of urgency in securing data on mobile devices speaks to a broad consumer misunderstanding about the severity of the threats posed by cybercriminals and the ease with which they can exploit an unprotected device.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/mcafee-2023-consumer-mobile-threat-report/\">McAfee 2023 Consumer Mobile Threat Report</a></p>\n<h2>The Gender Disparity in Mobile Device Security</h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising findings of the survey is the difference in mobile security behaviors between men and women. This difference illustrates not just a disparity in the type of personal information each group holds dear, but also the degree of risk each is willing to accept with their mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, men tend to place greater value on the content stored on their devices, such as photos, videos, and contact lists. Women, on the other hand, appear more concerned about the potential loss of access to social media accounts and personal communication tools like email. They are <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programme/connected-women/security-and-harassment-on-mobile-phones-a-growing-concern-for-women-in-emerging-markets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistically</a> more likely to experience online harassment and privacy breaches. This could explain why they are more concerned about the security of their social media accounts, as maintaining control over their online presence can be a way to protect against harassment and maintain a sense of safety.</p>\n<p>The loss of a mobile device, which for many individuals has become an extension of their social identity, can disrupt daily life significantly. This distinction illustrates that the consequences of lost or stolen mobile devices are not just financial, but social and emotional as well.</p>\n<h2>Risky Behaviors Persist</h2>\n<p>Despite the differences in what we value on our mobile devices, the survey showed a worrying level of risky behavior from both genders. Over half (55%) of respondents <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130224005140/en/McAfee-Reveals-Consumers-Fail-to-Protect-Their-Mobile-Devces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">admitted</a> sharing their passwords or PIN with others, including their children. This behavior not only leaves devices and data at risk of unauthorized access but also contributes to a wider culture of complacency around mobile security.</p>\n<p>Password protection offers a fundamental layer of security for devices, yet many people still choose convenience over safety. Setting a password or PIN isn&#8217;t a failsafe method for keeping your data safe. However, it is a simple and effective starting point in the broader effort to protect our digital lives.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/crack-the-pin/\">Put a PIN on It: Securing Your Mobile Devices</a></p>\n<h2>Steps to Mobile Device Security</h2>\n<p>While the survey results raise an alarm, the good news is that we can turn things around. It all begins with acknowledging the risks of leaving our mobile devices unprotected. There are simple steps that can be taken to ramp up the security of your devices and protect your personal information.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, password-protect all your devices. This means going beyond your mobile phone to include tablets and any other portable, internet-capable devices you may use. And, while setting a password, avoid easy ones like &#8220;1234&#8221; or &#8220;1111&#8221;. These are the first combinations a hacker will try. The more complex your password is, the sturdier a barrier it forms against unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Another important step is to avoid using the &#8220;remember me&#8221; function on your apps or mobile web browser. Although it might seem convenient to stay logged into your accounts for quick access, this considerably amplifies the risk if your device gets stolen or lost. It&#8217;s crucial to ensure you log out of your accounts whenever not in use. This includes email, social media, banking, payment apps, and any other accounts linked to sensitive information.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> If your phone is lost or stolen, employing a combination of tracking your device, locking it remotely, and erasing its data can safeguard both your phone and the information it contains.

Unlike traditional currencies issued by national governments (fiat money), Bitcoin is a decentralized form of money operated via a peer-to-peer network. This means it is not regulated or controlled by any central authority or government. This, along with many other characteristics, offers a range of benefits but also poses certain risks. In this article, we will examine these advantages and challenges to help you evaluate whether the benefits of Bitcoin outweigh the risks.</p>\n<h2>Overview of Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of money that is issued and managed without the need for a central authority. Not only is Bitcoin a single unit of currency (simply referred to as a “bitcoin”), but it is also the decentralized, peer-to-peer network that enables the movement of that currency.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded on a public ledger called <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/blockchain-basics-whats-blockchain-technology-and-how-might-it-change-our-lives/\">blockchain</a>. A user can access his or her bitcoins from anywhere in the world, as long as they have the private key to their unique Bitcoin address. Now, let’s delve into the inherent benefits and risks associated with Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>This digital cryptocurrency has gained immense popularity and continues to capture the imagination of investors, tech enthusiasts, and financial experts alike. As we dive into the world of Bitcoin, let’s also uncover the myriad benefits it brings to the table, from decentralization and security to financial inclusion and innovation.</p>\n<h3>Decentralization</h3>\n<p>As a decentralized form of currency, Bitcoin is not subject to control by any government, bank, or financial institution. This ensures that the value of Bitcoin is not affected by monetary policies or economic conditions of any specific country. It also means there is no need for intermediaries, such as banks, to process transactions. As a result, Bitcoin transactions can be faster and cheaper than traditional money transfers, particularly for international transactions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this decentralization offers potential benefits in regions where the local currency is unstable or access to banking is limited. For those without bank accounts, Bitcoin provides an alternative way to store and transact money. It also provides a safeguard against the risks of government-controlled fiat currency, such as inflation or deflation. This property of Bitcoin has been particularly attractive in countries experiencing hyperinflation, such as Venezuela.</p>\n<h3>Transparency and Anonymity</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, the blockchain, which is accessible to anyone. This ensures a high level of transparency, as the flow of Bitcoins and the transactions can be tracked by anyone. Nonetheless, while transactions are public, the identities of the parties involved are pseudonymous. This offers a level of privacy and anonymity to users, as their real-world identities are not directly connected to their Bitcoin addresses, offering more privacy than traditional banking systems.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because of its immutable and transparent nature, Bitcoin has potential uses beyond being a currency. The underlying blockchain technology has numerous potential applications, including secure sharing of medical records, supply chain management, and secure transfer of assets like land deeds and other legal documents.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/demystifying-blockchain-sifting-through-benefits-examples-and-choices/\">Demystifying Blockchain: Sifting Through Benefits, Examples and Choices</a></p>\n<h2>The Risks of Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin stands as both an enigma and a harbinger of change. Its meteoric rise to prominence has captivated the world, yet it has also garnered its fair share of scrutiny and caution. Now, let’s examine the flip side of the digital coin – the risks that come with it.</p>\n<p><b>Price Volatility</b></p>\n<p>One of the most well-known risks of Bitcoin is its price volatility. The value of a bitcoin can increase or decrease dramatically over a very short period. This volatility can result in significant financial loss. While some traders may enjoy this volatility because it provides exciting opportunities for high-return investments, it can be a risky venture for those seeking stability, particularly for those who intend to use Bitcoin as a regular currency.</p>\n<p>The volatility also makes Bitcoin less feasible as a store of value. With traditional currencies, individuals can expect the purchasing power of their money to remain relatively stable over short periods of time. With Bitcoin, however, the purchasing power can fluctuate wildly from day to day.</p>\n<h3>Security Issues</h3>\n<p>While the Bitcoin network itself has remained secure since its inception, the ecosystem around it is not entirely secure. Bitcoin wallets and exchanges, which are necessary for users to store and trade Bitcoins, have been the targets of hacking in the past. In some instances, users have lost their entire Bitcoin holdings.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction is initiated, it cannot be reversed. If the transaction is fraudulent or a mistake has been made, it cannot be corrected. This risk factor demands a high level of care and caution by Bitcoin users. The anonymity of Bitcoin can also facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering and the buying and selling illegal goods, which can impact users indirectly.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/crypto-scammers-exploit-elon-musk-speaks-on-cryptocurrency/\">Crypto Scammers Exploit: Elon Musk Speaks on Cryptocurrency</a></p>\n<h3>Regulatory Risks</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin operates in a relatively gray area of law and regulation. While it is not illegal, its status varies widely around the world. Some countries have embraced Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method, while others have banned or restricted it. The variability of regulation creates uncertainty and poses a risk for Bitcoin users. There’s also a risk that future regulation could adversely affect Bitcoin. For instance, if a major government declared Bitcoin use illegal, or one of the world&#8217;s largest exchanges was hacked, the value of Bitcoin could plummet.</p>\n<p>Due to Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature, lawmakers and regulatory bodies may find it difficult to draft and implement effective regulations that do not stifle innovation. The digital nature of Bitcoin also poses challenges with legal protections that are generally applied to traditional instruments, such as the ability to challenge fraudulent transactions.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cryptohacking-is-cryptocurrency-losing-its-credibility/\">Cryptohacking: Is Cryptocurrency Losing Its Credibility?</a></p>\n<h2>Comparison of Bitcoin’s Benefits and Risks</h2>\n<p>When comparing the benefits and risks of Bitcoin, it becomes clear that this cryptocurrency presents both unique opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, its decentralized and peer-to-peer nature offers a level of independence and flexibility not found in traditional financial systems. Additionally, its underlying blockchain technology offers potential for numerous applications beyond cryptocurrency itself.</p>\n<p>However, these benefits must be weighed against the risks they pose, including its high price volatility and security issues, and the potential consequences of an uncertain regulatory environment. These risks underline the need for caution and due diligence before investing in or transacting with Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is still in its early stages and will likely continue to evolve. As its regulatory environment becomes clearer and its technology becomes more established, the risks associated with Bitcoin may decrease. However, until then, a balanced perspective on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin is essential for anyone considering participating in its network.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip</i></b><i>: Bitcoin’s security issues are one of the main risks you need to consider and watch out for if you wish to invest in Bitcoin.

While its disruptive potential, innovation, and the allure of financial autonomy are undeniable, Bitcoin&#8217;s journey is punctuated with volatility, regulatory ambiguities, and security concerns that demand cautious consideration. As it continues to capture the world&#8217;s imagination, Bitcoin stands as both a symbol of the digital age&#8217;s possibilities and a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges associated with redefining the future of finance. Its ultimate role in the global economy remains uncertain, but its impact on the way we perceive and utilize money is undeniable, solidifying its place in history as a transformative force in the world of finance.</p>\n<p>As individuals, it is essential to safeguard your digital assets, traditional financial resources, and online financial dealings to ensure a secure and unrestricted existence in the modern world.

Cleaning up your PC has several advantages, including speeding up your system and safeguarding your <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/\">personal information</a> from potential threats. Besides, the process frees up storage space, enabling you to install more programs or store more multimedia files. A monthly clean-up is usually recommended for optimal results. Those who have never cleaned their PC might be in for a pleasant surprise with its much-enhanced speed and improved performance. In this guide, we will explain the ins and outs of PC cleaning to help you on the right path.</p>\n<h2>Understanding PC Cleaning</h2>\n<p>Over time, as you store multiple files on your PC, they begin to take up more and more space. Specifically, your C drive might be gradually filling up due to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/its-world-backup-day-heres-how-you-can-preserve-your-files/\">backup files</a>, hidden files, and temporary files. Additionally, even a new PC can benefit from a cleaning since it often comes with pre-installed programs that you might not need. So, what is PC cleaning? Essentially, it involves deleting unneeded files from your system when you want to free up storage space and enhance the overall performance of your PC.</p>\n<h2>Assessing Program Usage on Your PC</h2>\n<p>One of the first steps in PC cleaning involves removing unwanted programs. This can be done by accessing the &#8216;Programs and Features&#8217; section of your control panel. As a necessary measure, go through the list and note down the programs that you don&#8217;t use. If you encounter programs you don&#8217;t recognize, perform a quick internet search to understand their function before deleting them. Depending on the program&#8217;s size, removing them may not take long. Alongside removing unneeded programs, you can also use the disk cleanup utility to remove temporary files, which is another crucial aspect of PC cleaning.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> You may find Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP) while cleaning your computer. PUPs are not malware. The big thing to remember is that with PUPs, you&#8217;re saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to the download, even if you&#8217;re not fully aware of it because you didn&#8217;t read the fine print in the agreements or installation steps. However, Certain PUPs come bundled with spyware like keyloggers and dialers, as well as other software designed to collect your data, putting you at risk of identity theft. On the other hand, some may bombard your device with bothersome advertisements. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pup/\">Learn more about PUPs </a></i><i>to avoid downloading them unknowingly. </i></p>\n<h2>Cleaning Temporary Files</h2>\n<p>Temporary files consist of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-are-browser-cookies-and-how-do-i-manage-them/\">internet cookies</a> and partially downloaded programs that were never installed on your system. Internet cookies store information such as user login credentials and images from websites visited. They primarily identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages or save necessary information. One of the advantages of these cookies is that they save you from entering your login information each time you visit a website. Moreover, web pages and online media you visit are stored in your <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-cache/\">browser&#8217;s cache</a>, speeding up the browsing experience during your next visit.</p>\n<h2>The Importance of PC Cleaning</h2>\n<p>Your PC automatically stores files from the websites you visit on your hard drive. If not removed, these files accumulate over time and take up a significant amount of space on your PC. People often install programs on their PCs and forget to remove them after use, consuming much more space than they might think. Regular PC cleaning is an effective solution to prevent such issues.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-disk-cleanup-and-does-it-remove-viruses/\">What Is Disk Cleanup And Does It Remove Viruses?</a></p>\n<h2>Can Deleting Files Make Your PC Faster?</h2>\n<p>While many believe that deleting files from their hard drive can increase the speed of their PC, the effect might not be as substantial as expected. Your temporary internet files can quicken the speed at which websites load because these files contain images and other media from the websites you visit. Thus, your PC doesn&#8217;t have to download them whenever you visit the same websites. However, it&#8217;s still a good practice to delete your temporary files occasionally to free up disk space.</p>\n<h2>Removing Startup Items</h2>\n<p>Some programs that you download start automatically when you turn your PC on. Although automatic startup processes are beneficial for some programs, having too many can slow down your PC. It&#8217;s advisable to manage which apps run automatically during startup to enhance PC performance.</p>\n<h2>Factors to Consider When Cleaning Your PC</h2>\n<p>While deleting temporary internet files doesn&#8217;t pose much risk, deleting the wrong programs or certain startup items can harm your PC. Start by removing temporary files and reducing startup items to see if there&#8217;s a performance improvement. Additionally, when deleting programs, it&#8217;s crucial to be fully aware of what you&#8217;re deleting to avoid problems later on.</p>\n<h2>Cleaning Sensitive Files</h2>\n<p>When you delete files from the recycle bin, they remain on your system as the deletion only removes the pointer, not the file itself. Using a file shredder can help you erase such data by overwriting the space with a pattern of 1’s and 0’s. Although this doesn&#8217;t necessarily improve performance, it helps ensure compliance with the law and prevents <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\">identity theft</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why Cleaning Your PC is Essential?</h2>\n<p>When you own a computer, much like a car, regular maintenance and cleaning are essential. While it might not entirely increase your PC&#8217;s speed, it greatly improves efficiency and functionality, making all processes run smoother. This is because each time you visit a webpage, your computer stores all types of files to remember the website and load it faster next time. This cache gets flooded with files over time, slowing down your system. PC cleaning allows your PC to breathe, making it more responsive and liberating the storage space. Significantly, it helps in data management, eliminating all unnecessary data that might be misused or lead to identity theft.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/manage-data-data-privacy-day/\">Manage your data this Data Privacy Day</a></p>\n<p>Regular PC cleaning could also potentially save your device from significant damage. Unwanted programs and apps, especially those auto-starting ones, not only consume your system&#8217;s resources but also can contain malicious content impacting your PC. Regular cleaning will ensure any potential <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a> or problematic software is identified and removed promptly, thus adding a layer of protection.</p>\n<h2>How Does PC Cleaning Actually Work?</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s break down the PC cleaning process to simplify and understand it better. The process commences with uninstalling any unused apps and software. The next step involves clearing out temporary files, such as cache and cookies that accumulate over time and eat up storage space. Some PC cleaning programs also offer registry cleaning, which involves cleaning up the database that holds all the configuration settings for your PC. However, this is not always recommended.</p>\n<p>→<b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/to-disable-or-enable-cookies/\">To Disable or Enable Cookies</a></p>\n<p>Startup programs are another key area to look into. Having too many programs that start up when your computer boots can substantially slow down your system. Through PC cleaning, you can manage these programs and ensure only the necessary ones are allowed to auto-start. This will provide a noticeable improvement in your PC&#8217;s boot time and overall performance.

From online banking to medical records, protecting our private, personal information is imperative.</p>\n<p>Too often, the same password is used for multiple online accounts—for instance, you might log in to your online banking site with the same password you use for your personal email account. In a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/password-habits/\">McAfee survey</a>, 34% of people reported that they use the same password for multiple online accounts. Using identical passwords is convenient for us as users, but it’s also convenient for any hacker trying to steal personal information—once a hacker has access to one of your accounts, he can use a recycled password to snoop around at will.</p>\n<h2>Addressing Password Reuse and Complexity</h2>\n<p>Certainly, using more than one password and passphrases that include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols and is at least ten characters in length goes a long way towards keeping malicious people at bay, but unfortunately, merely adding variety to your login information doesn’t guarantee security. In The Easiest Ways to Not Get Hacked, author Rebecca Greenfield included this chart showing just how much difference one character in length makes:</p>\n<p>One of the most important accounts to keep secure is your primary email account—and here’s why: sooner or later, we all have to use the “I forgot my password” option, which typically sends a password reset email.</p>\n<p>A hacker only needs to crack the password for your primary email account, and he’ll be able to access any of your other secure accounts simply by clicking the “forgot password” button when he sees it. This is known as a single point of failure, meaning it’s the one piece in any system that can bring down your whole system.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> If you’re having trouble remembering all your complex passwords on multiple accounts, a password manager can help you save time and effort while securing your accounts and devices. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">Learn more about McAfee’s password manager</a>.</i></p>\n<h2>The Power of Two-step Verification</h2>\n<p>Establishing a separate email account for registration is one idea—in other words, your “I forgot my password” emails would all be sent to an account other than your primary email account. But even in that situation, there’s still only one password between a hacker and most of the data you want to keep from a hacker’s hands—from financial accounts and bank access to your weekly grocery delivery service. So the real question, even if you’re savvy enough to have a separate email address for password rescue, is: how do you make any email account more secure?</p>\n<p>Two-step verification (often referred to as two-factor authentication) is a system designed to give you an extra layer of security that’s easy to use and indispensable for commercial or highly sensitive accounts. Two-step verification protects your email with not only a password but also by associating your account with a specific device or devices. A recent example of how this works comes from Google. In the case of Google’s two-step verification for Gmail accounts, a user simply re-authorizes the account every 30 days, by providing a numeric code that confirms the account.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">Two-Factor vs. Multi-Factor Authentication: What’s the Difference?</a></p>\n<h3>How does it Work?</h3>\n<p>The extra step and learning a new system of security sounds like an enormous hassle, but Google has taken the pain out of the process by allowing you to obtain the code in one of three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Via Text:</strong> Google can send you a text message containing the code.</li>\n<li><strong>Via an Authenticator App:</strong> You can download a free app that will generate a randomized code at the time of sign-in</li>\n<li><strong>Via a Phone Call:</strong> You can receive an automated voice message to a non-mobile phone that tells you the code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that a hacker who wants to access your email account can only do so if he has access to your text messages or your landline phone. It might not stop every cybercriminal, but it does make the average hacker’s job a lot harder.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Some hackers may go as far as calling your personal numbers, if they have access to them, and ask for your two-factor verification code to access your financial accounts, citing that they need it for their ongoing promotions or measures to improve your account security. This is a social engineering tactic that you should familiarize yourself with. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/social-engineering-the-scammers-secret-weapon/\">Learn more about social engineering</a>.</i></p>\n<h2>Adoption and Future Trends</h2>\n<p>This two-factor authentication, while not new, is making major inroads among websites, apps, and services that process critical information. Many corporations have used hardware-based secondary authentication codes for years, but Google and others (including Twitter) are working hard to make this enhanced authentication flow a more practical and accessible part of our working lives.</p>\n<p>New biometric verification options, such as a retina or fingerprint scan, are also catching on among security-conscious consumers, and will likely be a feature on more devices in the future. As times change, and more sensitive information flows through these sites, we can be sure to see more of these processes put into place.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/virtual-reality-facebook-photo-hack/\">How Virtual Reality and Facebook Photos Helped Researchers Hack Biometric Security</a></p>\n<h2>Understanding the Benefits of Two-step Verification</h2>\n<p>Two-step verification offers multiple benefits in the world of digital security. The key merit is that it presents an extra hurdle for hackers to overcome. If a hacker has breached your password, they still have to pass the second level of verification. As such, two-step verification makes your information harder to access, giving you added peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Apart from enhancing security, two-step verification simplifies the recovery process if you ever forget your password. Since you have set up a secondary recovery method, you can use it to reset your password. This reduces the risk of losing access to your account due to forgotten passwords.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/lets-make-security-easy/\">Let’s Make Security Easy</a></p>\n<h2>Implementing Two-step Verification: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>\n<p>Setting up two-step verification on your accounts is relatively straightforward process. The first step is to go to the account settings of the platform where you want to enable this feature. Once you are there, locate the two-step verification or two-factor authentication option. Click on it, and follow the prompts. Typically, the system will ask for your phone number or an alternative email address to send the verification code to complete the process. Once that is done, you are all set.</p>\n<p>From then on, every time you log in, you will need to input not only your password but also a unique code sent to your phone number or alternative email. Remember to choose a method that is convenient for you. For instance, if you are always on your phone, it may be easier to opt for the text message verification code option. This ensures that you can always promptly complete the second step of verification whenever you log in.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/double-the-security-double-the-fun-protect-your-social-passwords-with-two-step-verification/\">Protect Your Social Passwords with Two-Step Verification</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges and Limitations of Two-step Verification</h2>\n<p>While two-step verification offers an added layer of security, it is not foolproof. One potential challenge is that a hacker could intercept the verification code. Despite its rarity, this type of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-data-breach-and-how-do-you-avoid-it/\">security breach</a> is possible and has occurred. Furthermore, you might face issues if you lose the device used for verification. For example, if you lose your phone and have set it up for receiving verification codes, you might struggle to access your accounts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, two-step verification can be inconvenient for some people. It adds an extra step every time you log in, and if you do not have immediate access to your verification device, you might be locked out of your accounts. Despite these challenges, the benefits of two-step verification far outweigh the potential drawbacks, and it remains a robust and recommended security measure in the digital era.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, two-step verification offers a critical layer of security in protecting your digital assets. As life becomes increasingly digitized, and we continue to store more personal and sensitive information online, it is crucial to employ strong security measures like two-step verification. While it might seem like a bit of a hassle at times, the added security it provides, the peace of mind and the protection of your personal information make it a worthwhile endeavor. As the old saying goes, &#8220;It&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Therefore, embrace two-step verification and make it harder for hackers to gain access to your information.

We frequently connect our devices to available Wi-Fi at various locations such as hotels, restaurants, cafes, and airports. The ability to be connected anywhere, anytime is extraordinary, but it also presents a significant security concern. Unsecured Wi-Fi networks can expose our personal and sensitive data to potential <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/what-is-a-hacker/\">hackers</a>.</p>\n<p>These hackers can gain access to our personal data stored on our devices or observe our online activities, thereby infringing our digital privacy. Sometimes, they purposely set up deceitful free Wi-Fi connections or hotspots to entice unsuspecting users and exploit their data. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to understand the risks associated with unsecured Wi-Fi connections and adopt certain preventive measures to ensure the safety of our personal data.</p>\n<h2>Risks of Using Free Wi-Fi or Hotspots</h2>\n<p>Using free Wi-Fi or hotspots can indeed be convenient for users when they&#8217;re away from their secure home networks. However, such networks usually lack proper security measures, rendering them highly susceptible to various <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/cybersecurity-reports-and-guides.html\">cyber attacks</a>. Hackers often target these networks as it is easier to infiltrate and access users&#8217; data.</p>\n<p>The most common risk is the interception of data, where hackers can view and steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. They can also inject malware into your device through the insecure network, further compromising your data and device&#8217;s security. Additionally, the Wi-Fi you&#8217;re connecting to might be a rogue hotspot set up by hackers, designed specifically to steal user information. Therefore, the use of such networks should be approached cautiously.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/krack-threatens-wi-fi/\">KRACK Hack Threatens Wi-Fi Security – What it Means for You</a></p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b> The most secure Wi-Fi network is the one that remains inactive. Deactivating the Wi-Fi signal on your device ensures that your device remains invisible, preventing your mobile from automatically connecting to any available Wi-Fi network. Pick up more tips on this <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-do-i-protect-myself-when-using-wi-fi/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Preventive Measures When Using Wi-Fi Connections</h2>\n<p>Despite these risks, there are several steps that you can take to ensure your cybersecurity while using Wi-Fi connections. Firstly, it&#8217;s a good practice to turn off your Wi-Fi when you&#8217;re not using it.

The usage of HTTPS, as against HTTP, ensures secure communication over the network as the data is encrypted. This reduces the chances of your data being intercepted by hackers. Hence, always look for &#8220;HTTPS://&#8221; in the address bar of your internet browser before sharing any sensitive information.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Security Measures</h2>\n<p>For an extra layer of security when using public Wi-Fi or hotspots, you might want to consider investing in a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a>. A VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it virtually impossible for hackers to intercept and view your data. While you&#8217;re connected to a VPN, all your network traffic passes through this protected tunnel, and no one—not even your ISP—can see your traffic until it exits the tunnel from the VPN server and enters the public internet.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/on-public-wi-fi-a-vpn-is-your-friend/\">On Public Wi-Fi, a VPN is Your Friend</a></p>\n<p>It is also advisable to keep all your devices, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/safe-browser/\">browsers</a>, and apps updated with the latest security patches. Hackers frequently exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software, so ensuring you have the latest updates can help prevent unauthorized access to your data. Enabling automatic updates ensures that your software is always up-to-date, further protecting against potential threats.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/software-updates-important/\">Why Software Updates Are So Important</a></p>\n<h2>Enhancing Protections at Home</h2>\n<p>Protecting your home Wi-Fi is equally important. Always <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/secure-your-passwords/\">password-protect</a> your home network with a strong, unique password, and consider changing the default user name and password that come with your router. Default logins can be easily found by attackers, making it easier for them to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, changing your router&#8217;s default Service Set ID (SSID) can make it more difficult for hackers to identify and target your network.</p>\n<p>Another step you can take is to set up a guest network for visitors to your home. This limits their access to your main network, where your sensitive information and devices are connected. Be sure to change the password for your guest network regularly, especially after hosting guests. Lastly, turning off your network when you&#8217;re not using it, especially when you&#8217;re away from home for extended periods, can reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/secure-home-wifi/\">How to Secure Your Home Wi-Fi</a></p>\n<h2>Enhancing Protections on Mobile</h2>\n<p>Smartphones have become indispensable tools for communication, work, and leisure. However, with the convenience of accessing Wi-Fi networks on these devices comes the responsibility of ensuring their security.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, prioritize trusted networks, such as your home or office, over open or public networks. Ensure that your connections are encrypted, preferably using WPA2 or WPA3, for data protection. Create robust, unique passwords for both your Wi-Fi network and your device connections.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, employ <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> for added security, especially for accounts linked to Wi-Fi access. Again, a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">VPN</a> can further bolster your defenses by encrypting your internet traffic, making it indispensable when using public Wi-Fi networks. But it’s also important to keep your mobile device&#8217;s software up-to-date to ensure you benefit from the latest security patches.</p>\n<p>Finally, be wary of connecting to mobile hotspots created by other devices, as these can pose security risks if not adequately secured, and regularly audit app permissions on your mobile device and restrict access to sensitive data whenever possible.</p>\n<p>By following these measures and best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your mobile devices when connecting to Wi-Fi networks, safeguarding your digital privacy and peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>With the growing reliance on Wi-Fi connections to access the internet on our devices, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the security risks associated with public Wi-Fi or hotspots. Unauthorized access, data interception, and malware infections are some of the key risks when using these connections.

This guide will walk you through why &#8220;123456&#8221; is not an acceptable password, dispel some common password misconceptions, and provide some tips on how to create a secure password.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Importance of Secure Passwords</h2>\n<p>Security is a necessary concern in the digital age. Every time we create an account, fill out a form, or simply browse the internet, we leave a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/digital-footprints-privacy-concerns/\">digital footprint</a> that can be traced back to us. Criminals, hackers, and other malicious parties are constantly hunting for sensitive information they can exploit. This is what makes the creation of secure passwords so vital.</p>\n<p>Think of your password as the first line of defense against potential attackers. When your passwords are weak or predictable, like &#8216;123456&#8217;, you effectively leave your front door open to criminals. While it may feel like an inconvenience to memorize complex passwords, consider the potential damage that could be done should your personal or financial information fall into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/why-passwords-matter/\">Protect Your Digital Life: Why Strong Passwords Matter</a></p>\n<h2>Why &#8216;123456&#8217; Is Not a Good Password</h2>\n<p>Some may argue that &#8216;123456&#8217; is a good password because it&#8217;s easy to remember. This is a dangerous misconception. &#8216;123456&#8217; is an extremely common password, and it&#8217;s also one of the first combinations that hackers attempt when trying to break into an account. In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/most-common-passwords-of-2022-make-sure-yours-isnt-on-the-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a>, &#8216;123456&#8217; and &#8216;password&#8217; are consistently ranked as the most commonly used passwords year after year.</p>\n<p>Another reason why &#8216;123456&#8217; is not a good password is due to its lack of complexity. Many websites and online services require passwords to include a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. This requirement is not arbitrary; it’s a method proven to increase the difficulty for hackers attempting to crack your password. Using &#8216;123456&#8217; as your password doesn&#8217;t meet these requirements, making it an easy target for a hacking attempt.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/six-easy-steps-to-help-keep-hackers-at-bay/\">Six Easy Steps to Help Keep Hackers at Bay</a></p>\n<h2>Essential Checks for a Secure Password</h2>\n<p>Ensuring that your password adheres to certain safety standards is crucial. Here are some key checks to consider when creating a password:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don&#8217;t Use a Real Word:</b> If your password contains a word that can be found in the dictionary, it&#8217;s time to change it. Using names of favorite items or pets can be easily guessed by hackers. Opt for an invented word, a blend of unique phrases or even nonsensical gibberish. The more unique, the better your security.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mix It Up:</b> Since most password systems are case-sensitive, using a mixture of upper and lower case letters can make your password more secure. Introduce numbers and symbols to make it more complex and avoid obvious choices like birthdays or the infamous &#8216;123456&#8217;.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Default is Fault:</b> All &#8220;smart&#8221; devices come with default passwords. From your latest smart home appliance to your phone, always change the provided password immediately after setup. This step, combined with regularly updating passwords, can greatly increase your protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/make-your-smart-home-a-secure-home-too-securing-your-iot-smart-home-devices/\">Make Your Smart Home a Secure Home Too: Securing Your IoT Smart Home Devices</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>One Password Doesn&#8217;t Fit All:</b> Never use the same password for multiple accounts. While it may seem difficult to remember multiple complex passwords, using a password management solution can help keep track of all your login information and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/password-generator.html\">generate unique, secure passwords</a> for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your proactive approach to password security is the bedrock of your defense against evolving <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/cybersecurity-reports-and-guides.html\">cyber threats</a>, ensuring your digital life remains safe and sound. Make sure to follow these reminders every time you create and change passwords.</p>\n<h2>Password Manager As An Option</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">Password managers</a> are specialized tools that generate, store, and autofill complex and unique passwords for various online accounts. They eliminate the need for users to remember and manually enter their passwords, and this not only simplifies the login process but significantly bolsters security. These tools employ strong encryption to safeguard your login credentials, ensuring your passwords remain inaccessible to hackers. Many password managers also offer the convenience of cross-device synchronization, allowing you to access your passwords securely on multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity threats are more sophisticated than ever, and easily guessable passwords are the first vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. So, as you aim to make your 123456 passwords more complicated, consider using a password manager to store all your passwords and help you remember them properly.</p>\n<h3>Changing Passwords: A Habit to Develop</h3>\n<p>Changing passwords frequently is a habit we all need to cultivate. Doing so regularly makes it very difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to your personal information. It&#8217;s not just about protecting your accounts, but every device that holds your precious data. This habit, though may seem cumbersome initially, will eventually act as a robust shield against potential cyber attacks. Interest in cyber security is rising, and for a good reason. With more of our lives moving online, it&#8217;s crucial to stay updated on the latest trends in mobile and digital security. Many resources are available online to help individuals stay safe in the digital world. Maintaining strong, unique passwords and changing them frequently is one of the simplest and most effective ways to safeguard against cyber threats.</p>\n<h2>How Often You Should Change Passwords</h2>\n<p>The frequency of changing passwords should be tailored to the security sensitivity of the account and the strength of the existing password. For high-security accounts, such as email or online banking, changing passwords every 60 to 90 days is advisable, while moderate-security accounts can be changed every 90 to 180 days. Low-security accounts may require less frequent changes, and immediate password updates are essential if you suspect a compromise. Strong, unique passwords reduce the necessity for frequent changes, and the use of two-factor authentication further enhances account security.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> In certain circumstances, it might become imperative to change your password without delay, particularly when a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to your account. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-often-should-you-change-your-passwords/\">Learn more about how often you should change your passwords</a></i><i>. </i></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>&#8216;123456&#8217; is not an acceptable password due to its predictability and lack of complexity. Choosing secure passwords that are complex, unique, and difficult to guess is crucial in safeguarding your online presence. Coupled with regular password changes, using a password management solution, and avoiding default device passwords, you can ensure your personal and financial information remains secure. In the digital age, a secure password is not just a need, but a necessity. A reliable <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">password manager</a>, meanwhile, is a good, functional option to improve password security.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/password-checklist/\">123456 Is Not an Acceptable Password</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Hold onto Your Phone, and Your Wallet – The Top Five Text Scams","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/hold-onto-your-phone-and-your-wallet-the-top-five-text-scams/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 28 Sep 2023 16:56:24 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175087"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092823.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092823.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092823-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Getting a text message is a lot like someone calling out your name.

It’s tough to ignore.</p>\n<p>Delivery notifications, messages from your bank, job offers, and security alerts—those texts have a way of getting your attention. And scammers know it. In the U.S. alone, their text-based scams accounted for a reported $330 million in losses in 2022—<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/06/iykyk-top-text-scams-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly a 5x increase</a> compared to 2019.</p>\n<p>When it comes time for scammers to reach their victims, text messages are the top choice.

Compare that to email, which has an open rate that hovers around 20% and a reply rate of 6%.</p>\n<p>In all, text scams make for cheap, easy, and effective attacks. Even more so with the help of highly convincing messages scripted by AI.</p>\n<p>Scammers simply have it easier and easier these days. Or so it can seem.

Here’s how they stack up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phony bank alerts and messages.</li>\n<li>Bogus gift offers that steal personal info.</li>\n<li>“Problems” with package deliveries.</li>\n<li>Job scams.</li>\n<li>Amazon imposter scams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sound familiar, like something that you’ve seen pop up on your phone? Chances are it does. In all, the scammers behind these texts want the same thing—your personal info, money, or a combination of both. They just take different routes to get there.</p>\n<p>Beyond the top five, the other 58% of scams put their spin on their texts. However, different as they are, these scam texts have several common signs you can spot.</p>\n<p>First off, they usually include a link. The link might include unusual strings of characters and a web address that doesn’t match who the message says it’s coming from. Like a bogus notice from the post office that doesn’t use the official post office URL. Or, the link might look <em>almost</em> like a legitimate address, but changes the name in a way that indicates it’s bogus.</p>\n<p>Instead of a link, the text might contain a phone number to call. Sophisticated scam operations run call centers that work much like legitimate call centers—although scammers design them to steal your money and personal info.</p>\n<p>The message might employ a scare tactic or threat. Scammers love this approach because it successfully plays on people’s emotions and gets them to act quickly without much thinking.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the text might be a seemingly innocent message. Like, “Is this Steven’s number?” Or, “I’ll always love you.” Sometimes it’s only a simple, “Hi.” This is by design. The scammer wants to pique your curiosity, or your desire to be helpful, and then respond. From there, the scammer will try to strike up a conversation, which can lead to a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/online-dating-scams-and-how-to-spot-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">romance scam</a> or a similar con game like an <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/online-job-scams-tiktokers-tell-their-stories-with-a-warning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online job scam</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to spot the top five text scams.</strong></h2>\n<p>Fortunately, scammers tend to follow a basic script. You’ll see variations, of course. Yet these texts share common elements, just as text scams in general do. That makes them easy to spot.</p>\n<p>Be on the lookout for:</p>\n<p><strong>Bank scams like, </strong>“BANK FRAUD ALERT: Did you make a $4,237.95 purchase at Jacuzzi World? Please confirm!” You’ll know if it’s a scam if the text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was sent from an institution you don’t bank with. That’s an immediate sign.</li>\n<li>Comes from an unrecognizable and unofficial number.</li>\n<li>Requests you to tap a link or call the number—likely to provide personal info.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gift scams like,</strong> “ATT FREE MESSAGE. Thanks for paying your bill. Click here for a reward.” First, you can note that the scammer spelled the phone carrier <em>AT&amp;T</em> incorrectly. Other signs of a scam include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The text involves tapping a link to claim your (bogus) prize—or calling an unknown number.</li>\n<li>It involves paying a fee for shipping your (bogus) prize.</li>\n<li>It similarly calls for submitting account or personal info to pay for your (bogus) winnings.</li>\n<li>The payout is for a lottery or giveaway you never entered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Delivery scams like,</strong> “We were unable to deliver your shipment. Please update your info so that we can get your package to you.” This is a common one, and you can spot it several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First off, you’re not expecting a package. Let alone one from the “company” that sent you the text.</li>\n<li>It contains a link that doesn’t look like it directs you to an official site, like UPS or FedEx.</li>\n<li>If you’re in North America, look at the number of the sender. Some scammers text from an overseas location. This can result in a long phone number that contains a country code with a “+” in front of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Job scams like,</strong> “BE A SECRET SHOPPER. Make $500 per store! Click the link to get started!” A company that hires employees by sending thousands of spammy texts isn’t a company at all. It’s a scam. Other signs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They ask you to tap a link or call a number, once again.</li>\n<li>The link looks like a string of nonsense or like a slightly fudged version of a legitimate web address.</li>\n<li>The job offer seems too good to be true. (Because it is.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Amazon scams like,</strong> “TRANSACTION ALERT: Your purchase of a 65” QLED TV for $1,599.99 is confirmed. Not you? Contact us to cancel the order.” This is a spin on the bank fraud alert, with the scammers posing as Amazon’s fraud team. Aside from using the Amazon name, other signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The text lists a big-ticket item with a big price tag to get your attention.</li>\n<li>There’s a sense of urgency. The text implies you need to act quickly to cancel the order.</li>\n<li>You have a number to call or a link to tap, which puts you in touch with a phony customer care rep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Now, how to avoid text scams.</strong></h2>\n<p>With what you need to spot scam texts, now you can avoid the damage they can do. And you can take additional steps to keep them from reaching you altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Don’t tap on links in text messages:</strong> If you follow one piece of advice, it’s this.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Follow up directly:</strong> If you have concerns, get in touch with the company you think might have sent it. Manually type in their website and enquire there. Again, don’t tap any links.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Clean up your personal data:</strong> Scammers must have gotten your number from somewhere, right? Often, that’s an <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-a-data-broker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online data broker</a>—a company that keeps thousands of personal records for millions of people. And they’ll sell those records to anyone. Including scammers. A product like our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> can help you remove your info from some of the riskiest sites out there.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Get scam protection:</strong> Using the power of AI, our new <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee Scam Protectio</a>n can alert you when scam texts pop up on your phone. And as a second line of defense, it can block risky sites if you accidentally follow a scam link in a text, email, social media, and more.</p>\n<p>Also, consider playing a part in the solution.</p>\n<p>Businesses, agencies, and law enforcement work together to shut down scams. Many of them have websites and points of contact for reporting fraud. <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/65674\">Netflix offers a good </a><a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/65674\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">so does the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/cyber-scam/customer-scam-awareness.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee has a page dedicated to fraud as well</a>.</p>\n<p>Further, in the U.S., you can also report it to the FTC at <a href=\"https://www.reportfraud.ftc.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>. Similarly, they use and share reports with law enforcement partners to help with investigations.</p>\n<p>If you spot a clear imposter or scam, give some thought to grabbing a screenshot and reporting it.</p>\n<h2><strong>You have what it takes to stop text scams.</strong></h2>\n<p>Even as scammers&#8217; attacks get more sophisticated, the tools that can beat them are more sophisticated as well. In part thanks to AI. With a sharp eye, tools like McAfee’s <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scam Protection</a> can help you steer clear of text scams.</p>\n<p>With both in place, you can improve the chances that your next incoming text is from a friend that brings a smile to your face—instead of a scam text that leaves you shaking your head.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/hold-onto-your-phone-and-your-wallet-the-top-five-text-scams/\">Hold onto Your Phone, and Your Wallet – The Top Five Text Scams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Could ChatGPT Be The Best Thing That’s Ever Happened To Your Family?","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/could-chatgpt-be-the-best-thing-thats-ever-happened-to-your-family/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 14:09:58 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=175125"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092923-2.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092923-2.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_092923-2-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>I have a confession to make – I so wish ChatGPT was around when my kids were younger.

I realise that it’s not perfect but in my opinion, it’s like having a personal digital assistant to help you wade through those super heavy parenting years. Imagine how helpful it would be to have your ‘assistant’ develop a personalised bedtime story for your 6-year-old or, work out what you can cook with just the ingredients in your fridge!! I am so sure I would have been a more relaxed mother if I had <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT</a> working for me!!</p>\n<p><strong>How Does </strong><strong>ChatGPT</strong><strong> Work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is an amazing website that allows you to have human-like conversations with a chatbot that is driven by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> technology. The chatbot can answer your questions, compose emails and essays, translate text, develop code and more. At the time of writing, there is a free version of ChatGPT available which gives the user unlimited access however the paid premium version of $US20 per month gives priority access during peak times, faster response speeds and exclusive access to GPT-4 – a smarter and more capable chatbot!</p>\n<p>If you’d like to know more about it, check out my <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\">Parents’ </a><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT</a><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\"> Guide</a> which will help fill in the blanks.</p>\n<p><strong>How </strong><strong>ChatGPT</strong><strong> Can Make You A Better Parent</strong></p>\n<p>There are so many ways ChatGPT can reduce the stress of parenting and give you some much-needed head space. Here are my top 5:</p>\n<p><strong>1. What’s For Dinner?</strong></p>\n<p>If I look back at the super intense parenting years when I was working full-time with 4 kids, one of the greatest causes of my stress was dinner. I often wouldn’t have the physical energy to read a recipe book or stop at the shops after an afternoon of school and extra-curricular pickups so I would be scrambling to feed a bunch of ravenous boys. Imagine how good it would be to have your digital assistant, aka ChatGPT, devise a recipe based on what you have in your fridge and pantry? Nothing short of life-changing, in my opinion. And it can even factor in dietary restrictions! So clever!!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Can You Tell Me A Bedtime Story</strong></p>\n<p>My boys loved bedtime stories – preferably personalised! I know, very demanding!! Now, with 4 separate stories to deliver every night, you can only imagine how much mental energy this required. But if I had ChatGPT working for me, this would take just seconds to solve. Simply enter the name and age of the child (no surnames), the setting, the names of other characters that should be included, and then a theme e.g. hero’s journey, determination, friendship, and wham bam – you’ve got something ready to go!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Your Next Holiday – Sorted!</strong></p>\n<p>When things are so hectic, it is often the thought of a vacation that can keep you going. However, let’s be honest, successful holidays take quite a bit of planning to get right. Well – that’s where your digital assistant can help. If you ask, ChatGPT can develop itineraries with activity suggestions. It can also recommend hotels – simply ask it for suggestions within a specific location e.g. close to the Eiffel Tower. And it can also tailor its recommendations based on your budget. After planning and managing family holidays for my clan of 6 for well over 20 years, this is a life-changing feature!</p>\n<p><strong>4. The Best Birthday Party Checklist Ever</strong></p>\n<p>Far out, birthday parties can be stressful experiences. Invitations, themes, venue, entertainment, kids’ food, lolly bags, parents’ food, parents’ drinks, the list goes on and on. But if you haven’t already put ChatGPT to work as a party planner – then you’re missing out. Simply type in the age of the child and it can give you an entire plan. It will also give you 20-25 top tips that I guarantee will ensure you have everything covered!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Homework Help </strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve got a tribe of kids who are all at various levels and need homework help, then staying up to date with maths and science can be quite exhausting – particularly after a long day at work! Simply entering ‘explain’ or ‘explain so a 10-year-old can understand’ into ChatGPT will provide you with enough smarts to get that homework done. Of course, fact-checking ChatGPT is essential but what it will provide is some momentum in the right direction.</p>\n<p><strong>But A Word of Caution</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> can absolutely make your life easier as a parent but there are a few things to remember before you start typing into that chat box.</p>\n<p><strong>1. It Doesn’t Always Get Everything Right</strong></p>\n<p>It’s important to double-check everything. Ensure your kids also appreciate that everything online needs to be double-checked.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Be Mindful of Your Privacy When Using It</strong></p>\n<p>For a full explanation of its impact on privacy and how you can protect yourself, check out my recent blog post about . But to summarise: be careful what you share in the chat box, stay anonymous, and consider deleting your chat history.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Consider How You Use It With Your Kids</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest negatives of ChatGPT is its potential impact on creativity and thinking skills. Some schools and universities have banned its use while others have specialised programs that supposedly can detect whether a student has used it. While it does sadden me that our kids won’t need to struggle over complex maths questions or English essays like we did, I am a realist and believe that whether we like it or not – it is here to stay. My prediction is that the school and university systems will adapt because generative AI will be a part of our kids’ world. Our role as parents and educators is to teach them how to use it safely and with a critical-thinking mindset.</p>\n<p>So, if you’ve dreamed about hiring a personal assistant (I do regularly!) then you so need to check out ChatGPT. It will help you get through your ‘to-do’ list, save you so much time and energy which means you’ve got more time to spend with your kids – or by yourself under a tree.

There’s a long list of topics to cover off when you are a parent. But if you take a minute to picture someone stealing your child’s identity or using their personal information to take out a loan for a shiny new car then you’ll probably want to move it closer to the top of your parenting to-do list!</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Identity Theft?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Identity theft</a> occurs when a person’s personal identifying information is used without their permission, usually to commit fraud by making unauthorised purchases or transactions. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/5-common-types-of-identity-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Identity theft can happen in many ways</a>, but its victims are usually left with significant damage to their finances, credit score, and even their mental health.</p>\n<p>Most people associate identity theft with data breaches &#8211; think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/optus-data-breach-everything-we-know-so-far-about-what-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latitudefinancial.com.au/latitude-cyber-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Latitude Financial</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/medibank-confirms-that-every-customer-s-personal-data-was-accessed-in-hack-20221026-p5bsy7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medibank</a> &#8211; however, there are many more ways that scammers can get their hands on your personal identifying details. They can use <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘phishing’ emails</a> to get information from you, do a deep dive on your social media accounts to find identifying information in posts or photos, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/the-risks-of-public-wi-fi-and-how-to-close-the-security-gap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hack public Wi-Fi</a> to access any information you share or simply, steal your wallet or go through your trash!!</p>\n<p><strong>How Big An Issue Is It Really?</strong></p>\n<p>In short, it’s a big problem &#8211; for both individuals and organisations. And here are the statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>76,000 cybercrime reports</strong> were made in the 2021/22 financial year, an increase of nearly 13% from the previous year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report-july-2021-june-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Annual Cyber Threat Report</a> by The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC).</li>\n<li>A recent study by <a href=\"https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/sb/sb42#:~:text=Thirty%2Done%20percent%20of%20respondents,their%20bank%20statements%20or%20accounts.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Australian Cybercrime Survey</a> showed that <strong>31% of respondents had experienced identity crime in their lifetime and 20% within the previous 12 months</strong>. Just under half of the victims reported that they had noticed suspicious transactions on their bank statements. Although 25% of respondents couldn’t identify how their information was stolen, 16% attributed it to the hacking of a computer or device.</li>\n<li><strong>10 million</strong> Australians had their personal details stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-21/optus-hack-class-action-customer-privacy-breach-data-leaked/102247638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optus data breach</a> in September 2022.</li>\n<li><strong>7 million</strong> Australians also had personal data stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-01-17/medibank-hack-data-breach-complaint-explainer/101858182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medibank data breach</a> in October 2022.</li>\n<li><strong>14 million</strong> Australians had their personal information stolen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/28/latitude-financial-faces-possible-class-action-after-millions-affected-by-data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Latitude Financial data breach</a> in March 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How Do You Know If You’re a Victim?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest issues with identity theft is that you often don’t immediately know that you’re a victim. In some cases, it might take weeks before you realise that something is awry which unfortunately, gives the thief a lot of time to wreak havoc! Some of the signs that something might be wrong include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfamiliar charges to your bank account</li>\n<li>Calls and texts about products or services that you’ve never used</li>\n<li>You’re denied credit</li>\n<li>Strange emails in your inbox</li>\n<li>Not receiving expected mail</li>\n<li>Unexpected calls or letters from debt collectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What To Do If You Think You’re a Victim</strong></p>\n<p>The key here is to act as soon as you believe you are affected. Don’t stress that there has been a delay in taking action – just take action now! Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Call Your Bank</strong></p>\n<p>Your first call should be to your bank so they can block the affected account. The aim here is to prevent the scammer from taking any more money. Also remember to block any cards that are linked to this account, either credit or debit.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Change Your Passwords</strong></p>\n<p>If your identity has been stolen then it’s highly likely that the scammer knows your passwords so change the passwords for the affected accounts straight away!! And if you have used this same password on any other accounts then change these also. If you can’t remember, you can always reset the passwords on key accounts just to be safe.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Report It</strong></p>\n<p>It may feel like a waste of time reporting your identity theft, but it is an important step, particularly as your report becomes a formal record – evidence you may need down the track. It may also prevent others from becoming victims by helping authorities identify patterns and hopefully, perpetrators.  If you think your personal identifying information has been used, report it to the Australian authorities at <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ReportCyber</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Make a Plan</strong></p>\n<p>It’s likely you’re feeling pretty overwhelmed at what to do next to limit the damage from your identity theft – and understandably so! Why not make a contract with <a href=\"https://www.idcare.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDCARE</a>? It’s a free service dedicated to assisting victims of identity theft &#8211; both individuals and organisations &#8211; in Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>How Do We Talk To Our Kids About It?</strong></p>\n<p>If there is one thing I have learned in my 20+ years of parenting, it is this. If you want to get your kids ‘onboard’ with an idea or a plan, you need to take the time to explain the ‘why’. There is absolutely no point in asking or telling them to do something without such an explanation. It is also imperative that you don’t lecture them. And the final ingredient? Some compelling statistics or research – ideally with a diagram &#8211; my boys always respond well to a visual!</p>\n<p>So, if you haven’t yet had the identity theft chat with your kids then I recommend not delaying it any further. And here’s how I’d approach it.</p>\n<p>Firstly, ensure you are familiar with the issue. If you understand everything I’ve detailed above then you’re in good shape.</p>\n<p>Secondly, arm yourself with relevant statistics. Check out the ones I have included above. Why not supplement this with a few relevant news stories that may resonate with them? This is your ‘why’.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, focus on prevention. This needs to be the key focus. But don’t badger or lecture them. Perhaps tell them what you will be doing to minimise the risk – see below for your key ‘hot tips’ – you’re welcome!</p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Do To Manage Identity Theft?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few key things that you can today that will both minimise your risk of becoming a victim and the consequences if you happen to be caught up in a large data breach.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Passwords</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Managing passwords</a> for your online accounts is one of the best risk management strategies for identity theft. I know it’s tedious, but I recommend creating a unique and complex 10+ digit password for each of your online accounts. Tricky passwords make it harder for someone to get access to your account. And, if you use the same log-in details for each of your online accounts &#8211; and your details are either leaked in a data breach or stolen &#8211; then you could be in a world of pain. So, take the time to get your passwords sorted out.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Think Before You Post</strong></p>\n<p>Sharing private information about your life on social media makes it much easier for a scammer to steal your identity. Pet names, holiday destination and even special dates can provide clues for passwords. So, lock your social media profiles down and ensure your privacy settings are on.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be Proactive &#8211; Monitor Your Identity Online</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine how good it would be if you could be alerted when your personal identifying information was found on the Dark Web? Well, this is now a reality! McAfee’s latest security offering entitled <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a> will not only protect you against threats but provide 24/7 monitoring of your personal details so it can alert you if your information is found on the Dark Web. And if your details are found, then advice and help may also be provided to remedy the situation. How good!!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Using Public Computers and Wi-Fi With Caution</strong></p>\n<p>Ensuring you always log out of a shared computer is an essential way of keeping prying eyes away from your personal identifying information. And always be super careful with public Wi-Fi. I only use it if I am desperate and I never conduct any financial transactions, ever! Cybercriminals can ‘snoop’ on public Wi-Fi to see what’s being shared, they can stage ‘Man in The Middle Attacks’ where they eavesdrop on your activity, or they can lure you to use their trustworthy sounding Wi-Fi network – designed purely to extract your private information!</p>\n<p><strong>5. Monitor Your Bank Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Why not make a habit of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regularly checking your bank accounts</a>? And if you find anything that doesn’t look right contact your bank immediately to clarify. It’s always best to know if there is a problem so you can address it right away.</p>\n<p>With so many Aussies affected by data breaches and identity theft, it’s essential that our kids are armed with good information so they can protect themselves as best as possible.

These malicious apps managed to outwit the store&rsquo;s security checkpoints to install malware on the unsuspecting users&rsquo; devices. It is more important than ever to stay vigilant about mobile security.</p>\n<p>The crafty hackers behind this threat disguised their <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-trojan/\">trojans</a> as commonly searched-for apps, such as QR code scanners, fitness apps, and other popular utilities. The malicious code within these apps is specifically designed to steal banking information, record keystrokes as users enter their account details, and capture screenshots of activities carried out on the phone.</p>\n<h2>Understanding The Malware Threat</h2>\n<p>The unique feature of this <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a> is that it only initiates its harmful activities after being installed. Whether or not the user is aware of the malware&#8217;s presence can vary. For the malware to trigger, it needs an additional step, often an in-app update that&#8217;s not through the Play Store. This update then downloads the malware payload onto the device. In numerous instances, the counterfeit apps force users into accepting this update once the app is downloaded.</p>\n<p>While the apps originally found on the Play Store may not have contained malware in their code, they serve as a delivery system for the payload from other servers after being installed on a user&#8217;s device. This discrete method of operation is one of the reasons these harmful apps have managed to escape detection.</p>\n<p>The evolving threat highlights the necessity of scrutinizing app permissions and being cautious of in-app prompts, especially if they deviate from the standard update processes provided by reputable app stores. As the malware landscape evolves with increasingly sophisticated tactics, understanding these threats and adopting proactive security measures is crucial for safeguarding the integrity of our digital devices and personal data.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/security-news/mcafee-2023-threat-predictions-evolution-and-exploitation/\">McAfee 2023 Threat Predictions: Evolution and Exploitation</a></p>\n<h2>The Allure of Smartphones to Hackers</h2>\n<p>Smartphones are enticing targets for hackers. They contain personal information and photos, banking and other payment app credentials, and other valuable data that hackers can exploit. The smartphone&#8217;s other features&mdash;like cameras, microphones, and GPS&mdash;can offer hackers even more invasive capabilities.</p>\n<p>Once a smartphone is compromised, a hacker can hijack social media, shopping, and financial accounts; drain wallets by racking up app store purchases or interfering in payment apps; and even read text messages or steal photos. Understanding the nature of these threats, it is essential for users to take protective measures.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/mcafee-2023-consumer-mobile-threat-report/\">McAfee 2023 Consumer Mobile Threat Report</a></p>\n<h2>The Responsibility of App Developers in Ensuring Security&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Mobile applications have become an integral part of our lives, so the responsibility of app developers to ensure security is paramount. Users entrust these apps with their personal information, from contact details to financial data, making it imperative for developers to prioritize security throughout the entire app development process.</p>\n<p>One of the primary responsibilities of app developers is to implement secure coding practices. This entails writing code that guards against vulnerabilities and potential exploits. Developers can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches by incorporating measures like robust authentication systems, data encryption, and secure data transmission protocols. Additionally, regular security audits and testing are essential to identify and rectify vulnerabilities promptly.</p>\n<p>App developers must also be vigilant when it comes to user data protection. This involves not only securely storing sensitive information but also safeguarding it during transmission. Properly managing app permissions is another key aspect of ensuring user data privacy. Developers should request only the permissions necessary for an app&#8217;s core functionality and explain clearly to users why certain permissions are required.</p>\n<p>To complete the discussion, app developers play a pivotal role in safeguarding user data and overall digital security. By adhering to secure coding practices, conducting regular security assessments, respecting user privacy, and responding swiftly to vulnerabilities, developers contribute to a safer and more trustworthy mobile app ecosystem. Ultimately, their commitment to security not only protects users but also upholds the integrity of the apps they create.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> App developers can only protect you if you download their applications from reputable app stores like Google Play and App Store. Downloading third-party applications can increase your risk of getting malware. Know more about </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/are-third-party-apps-for-you/\"><i>third-party apps</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n<h2>Mechanics of Malicious Apps</h2>\n<p>How do these harmful apps work? By presenting themselves as legitimate applications, they can sneak onto your phone and gain wide-ranging permissions to access files, photos, and functionalities. Alternatively, they may slip in code that enables hackers to gather personal data. This can result in various issues, from annoying popup ads to the loss of valuable identity information.</p>\n<p>Some recent instances of such malicious apps include ad-blocking programs that serve up ads instead, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">VPN</a> apps that charge subscriptions but provide no protection, and utility apps that misuse system privileges and permissions, further endangering users.</p>\n<p>To avoid falling victim to such malicious apps, there are preventive steps you can take.</p>\n<h2>Seven Steps to Safer Mobile App Downloads</h2>\n<p>While major app marketplaces like Google Play and Apple&#8217;s App Store aim to eradicate malware from their platforms, hackers, being the persistent intruders they are, can find ways around these measures. Hence, extra vigilance on your part is essential. Below are some steps to help fortify your digital security:</p>\n<h3>1. Scrutinize App Permissions</h3>\n<p>Be wary of apps asking for unnecessary permissions, like simple games wanting access to your camera or microphone. Read the permissions list before downloading any app. If you find an app asking for more than it should need, it may be a scam. Delete it, and find a legitimate counterpart that doesn&#8217;t request for these invasive permissions.</p>\n<h3>2. Beware of In-App Updates</h3>\n<p>Apps prompting you for immediate in-app updates can be a red flag. Typically, the app version you download from the store should be the most recent and not require an immediate update. Always update your apps through the app store, not the app itself, to avoid malware attacks.</p>\n<h3>3. Be Critical When Reviewing Apps</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t download without researching the app first. Check the developer&#8217;s track record &#8211; have they published other apps with many downloads and good reviews? Malicious apps often have few reviews and grammatical errors in their descriptions. Stay alert for these signs.</p>\n<h3>4. Trust Strong Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Recommendations from trusted sources or reputable publications are often reliable as these sources have done the vetting for you. This method saves you time and ensures the app&#8217;s credibility.</p>\n<h2>Protecting Your Smartphone Against Malware</h2>\n<h3>5. Avoid Third-Party App Stores</h3>\n<p>Stick to Google Play and Apple&#8217;s App Store, which vet apps for safety and security. Third-party sites might not have a robust review process, and some intentionally host malicious apps.

With the use of smartphones, we perform a myriad of activities daily, from making phone calls and sending messages to shopping online and managing bank accounts. While these activities bring convenience, they also expose users to various security threats. Your Android PIN code is a critical aspect that protects your phone data from unauthorized access. But how safe is this four-digit code? This article aims to demystify this question and offers a comprehensive guide on the safety of Android PIN codes.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Android PIN Code</h2>\n<p>A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a security code used to protect your mobile device from unauthorized access. It is usually a 4-digit number, though some devices allow longer PINs. When you set up a PIN, the device <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-encryption/\">encrypts</a> data and can only be accessed by entering the correct PIN. The idea behind the PIN is that it is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. But is this method of protecting your data foolproof?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The first line of defense for your smartphone is a simple PIN code. Many users choose easy-to-remember combinations such as &#8220;1234&#8221; or &#8220;1111.&#8221; However, these are easily guessable and thus not very secure. Furthermore, a determined thief could try all 10,000 possible four-digit combinations until they hit the right one. This process could be done manually, but it has been demonstrated that it could also be automated with a device like the R2B2 robot, which can try all combinations in less than 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>R2B2</h2>\n<p>The R2B2, or Robotic Reconfigurable Button Basher, is a small robot designed with a single, solitary function: to crack any Android four-digit locking code. Justin Engler, a security engineer at iSEC , created itPartners. The R2B2 uses a &#8216;brute force&#8217; method of entering all 10,000 possible combinations of four-digit passcodes until it finds the right one. It doesn&#8217;t use specialized software or <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a>; it simply inputs combinations until it gets the right one.</p>\n<p>Although the chances of your phone falling into the clutches of an R2B2 are slim, such technology raises concerns about the security of a four-digit PIN. If a simple robot can crack the code in less than a day, it questions the efficacy of a four-digit passcode in protecting your mobile data. This emphasizes the need for more robust, more secure forms of password protection.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/crack-the-pin/\">Put a PIN on It: Securing Your Mobile Devices</a></p>\n<h2>How to Improve Your Android PIN Security?</h2>\n<p>Even though a four-digit PIN remains one of the most common forms of mobile security, it may not necessarily be the most secure. For times when a PIN code does not offer sufficient protection, alternative security measures can step in. Advanced Android users can access a wide range of security features beyond the conventional four-digit PIN, including patterns, passwords, and biometrics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Patterns:</b> Pattern lock screens involve drawing a simple pattern on a grid of nine dots. Although they can be less secure than a four-digit PIN, they offer intuitive and user-friendly options.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Passwords:</b> Alternatively, some users opt for passwords instead of PINs for added security. Passwords are typically longer and can include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks. For a more complex option, full passwords can be used. Android supports complex alphanumeric passwords, which can include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/tips-for-creating-passwords/\">5 Tips For Creating Bulletproof Passwords</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Biometrics</b>: Biometrics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, offer the highest level of security and convenience. However, it&#8217;s important to note that while convenient, biometric data, if compromised, cannot be easily changed, unlike a PIN or password.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/mastercard-biometrics-2016/\">MasterCard Wants to Verify by Selfies and Fingerprints! The Ripple Effects of Biometric Data?</a></p>\n<h2>Additional Security Measures</h2>\n<p>Beyond passcodes and biometrics, there are a range of additional security measures that can be implemented to protect your phone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PIN Length and Complexity</b>: You can enhance the security of your PIN by increasing its length and complexity. Instead of a traditional 4-digit PIN, consider using a longer PIN with more digits. A 6-digit or 8-digit PIN provides significantly more combinations, making it harder for attackers to guess.</li>\n<li><b>Alphanumeric PINs</b>: Utilize alphanumeric PINs by incorporating both letters and numbers. This increases the complexity of your PIN and makes it more resilient to brute-force attacks. For example, you could use a combination like &#8220;P@ssw0rd&#8221; as your PIN.</li>\n<li><b>Customizable PIN: </b>Some Android devices allow you to create custom PINs that are not limited to just digits. You can choose a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a unique and secure PIN.</li>\n<li><b>Regular PIN Change: </b>To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, change your PIN regularly. This practice can thwart attackers who might have obtained your previous PIN through various means.</li>\n<li><b>Lock Screen Timeout:</b> Adjust the lock screen timeout settings on your device. This determines how quickly your device locks itself after inactivity. A shorter timeout reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.</li>\n<li><b>Hidden PIN Entry</b>: Some Android devices offer an option to hide the PIN entry as you type it, making it harder for someone nearby to observe your PIN.</li>\n<li><b>Lockout Policy: </b>Configure the lockout policy on your device to lock it temporarily after a certain number of failed PIN attempts. This discourages brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.</li>\n<li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</b>: Using more than <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">one form of verification</a> (like 2FA) adds an additional layer of security that makes it harder for unauthorized users to access your device.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Device Encryption: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-encryption/\">Encryption</a> converts data into a format that can only be read with the correct encryption key, making it much harder for anyone who does break your passcode to make sense of your data.</li>\n<li><b>Remote Wipe:</b> Set up remote wipe capabilities if your device is lost or stolen. This allows you to remotely erase all data on your device to protect your sensitive information.</li>\n<li><b>Secure Lock Screen Widgets:</b> Disable lock screen widgets that may display sensitive information, as they can potentially leak data even with a secure PIN.</li>\n<li><b>Security Updates:</b> Keep your device&#8217;s operating system and security software up to date. Manufacturers often release security patches to address vulnerabilities, so installing these updates promptly is essential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Refrain from sharing your PIN codes and passwords with anyone. Use a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">reputable password manager</a> to efficiently and securely manage your collection of passwords and passcodes</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While the advent of technology like R2B2 does raise concerns about the sufficiency of a four-digit PIN, this is only part of the story. The landscape of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html\">mobile security</a> is variable and complex, and it&#8217;s essential to stay vigilant. By using a mix of solid passcodes (or alternative forms of security like biometrics), implementing additional security measures, and regularly updating and reviewing your security settings, you can significantly enhance the security of your Android device.

The Power Hungry archetype, however, is just a nasty, unkind person who wants to display dominance and control over others. Then there&#8217;s the Inadvertent Cyberbully, who are usually the ones getting bullied online or in real life and are typically trying to enact some form of justice or revenge anonymously from the web. Mean Girls are the opposite &ndash; and take their online actions in order to impress a group of friends or gain social status.</p>\n<h2>Cyberbullying Methods</h2>\n<p>Not only is there a variety in the kinds of bullies across the web, but also many<a href=\"https://www.endcyberbullying.org/5-different-types-of-cyberbullying/\"> types of cyberbullying techniques</a>&nbsp;these meanies use to bother their victims. First and foremost, there&#8217;s harassment, which involves repeated, offensive messages sent to a victim by a bully on some type of online medium. These messages can be rude, personal, and even threatening, with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmacramalla/2018/06/13/legal-fallout-from-disturbing-allegations-of-cyberbullying-against-erik-karlsson-and-his-wife/#2eca3d055be4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one recent example</a> emerging between two wives of professional hockey players. Similar to harassment is Flaming &ndash; an online fight conducted via emails, social media messages, chat rooms, you name it.</p>\n<p>Then there are very targeted attacks, named Exclusion and Outing. With Exclusion, cyberbullies select one individual to single out. Exclusion is a popular method, with examples everywhere, from <a href=\"https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/education/sioux-city-student-victimized-by-cyber-bullying-still-looking-for/article_ba569f83-2296-5407-a41e-0a1b52515e2f.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high students in Iowa</a> to <a href=\"https://studybreaks.com/tvfilm/social-medias-toxic-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-known celebrities</a>. With Outing, these harassers share private information, photos, and videos of a single person to humiliate them online. There&#8217;s also the anonymous angle, AKA Masquerading, where a cyberbully creates a fake online identity to belittle, harass, and degrade their victim &ndash; which a <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11944648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nurse in New Zealand</a> was a victim of for a whopping five years.</p>\n<h2>Cyberbullying Prevention Tips</h2>\n<p>Parents should inform their children that their online activities will be monitored using parental control software. Explaining how this software works and how it can protect them is essential. This policy should be well established before your child gets their phone or computer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, parents should discuss cyberbullying with their children and help them understand how it happens. This discussion should take place before your child gets their devices. Before a child gets their own digital devices, they must disclose their passwords to their parents. Parents can reassure them that these passwords will only be used during emergencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Setting Conditions for Device Ownership</h2>\n<p>A condition set before children get their own digital devices is that they should consent to instructions on smart online habits. Importantly, they must understand that once something is posted online, it stays there forever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another essential guideline for owning a device is that children should be cautious about their personal information. They should be advised not to publicly share their cell phone number and email address and should never disclose their passwords, even to close friends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/8-signs-it-may-be-time-for-parental-controls/\">8 Signs It May Be Time for Parental Controls</a></p>\n<h2>Role-Playing for Cyberbullying</h2>\n<p>Once your child obtains their digital devices, engaging in role-playing exercises with them is suggested. This allows parents to simulate scenarios where the child might encounter a cyberbully, teaching them appropriate responses. This exercise can also provide a safe space for your child to practice dealing with cyberbullying tactics and learn to act assertively without resorting to aggression or submission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this role-playing activity, parents should encourage their children to report any bullying incidents, even if it is simulated or perceived as insignificant. This activity not only cultivates resilience but also reassures children that they won&#8217;t be blamed or punished for being a victim of cyberbullying.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Maintaining Awareness of Online Activities</h2>\n<p>Parents must maintain vigilance regarding their child&#8217;s internet activities despite all preventive measures. Regular check-ins and encouraging open communication about their online experiences can create a strong bond of trust between parents and children. Assure them they can approach you without fear if they are bullied online. Encourage them to share any suspicious interactions and reassure them that they won&#8217;t be in trouble for reporting cyberbullying incidents.</p>\n<p>If possible, try to familiarise yourself with the social media platforms that your children are using. Understanding these platforms can provide insight into their online experience and potential risks. Such knowledge can be valuable when initiating discussions about cyberbullying, providing tangible examples and relatable scenarios.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip</i></b><i>: Get </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/parental-controls/\"><i>McAfee&#8217;s parental control</i></a><i> to safeguard your children against online threats and cyberbullying.

This is not a matter exclusive to the &#8220;other&#8221; kids &#8211; it affects everyone, and young individuals&#8217; innocent and accepting nature often leads them into the dangerous trap of these predators.</p>\n<p>As parents, caregivers, and mentors, it&#8217;s our responsibility to educate and guide our children about the virtual perils that lurk within their screens. An essential part of this is continuous communication, ensuring they understand the gravity of the situation and can recognize the deceptive tactics employed by these predators.</p>\n<h2>The Tragic Tale of Nicole Lovell</h2>\n<p>A heartbreaking example of how these predators operate is the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/near-virginia-tech-a-13-year-olds-online-fantasies-turn-fatal/2016/02/01/6a627bb8-c90d-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">story</a> of Nicole Lovell, a 13-year-old girl who made headlines not long ago. Nicole met David Eisenhauer, an engineering student from Virginia Tech, through the messaging app <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/kik-app-moment/\">Kik</a>. Their relations initially seemed harmless, characterized by playful flirtations and shared stories. However, their friendship took a horrific turn when they decided to meet in person, leading to Nicole&#8217;s tragic demise. Her body was found shortly after their encounter.</p>\n<p>David exhibited no signs of having a &#8216;dark side,&#8217; an aspect that made their meeting seem all the more innocent. This incident is a stark reminder that anyone can fall prey to such predators, regardless of their background or circumstances. This is why discussing and dissecting such incidents with our children is crucial to teaching them the harsh realities of the digital world.</p>\n<h2>Recognizing the Traits of Online Predators</h2>\n<p>Identifying an online predator&#8217;s markers is a critical aspect of child safety education. More often than not, these individuals are cunning and mentally unbalanced and spend a significant amount of their time seeking and &#8216;grooming&#8217; their prospective victims online. The ultimate goal of these predators is to exploit children, either by convincing them to send inappropriate photos or by meeting them in person.</p>\n<p>Initiating a continuous dialogue with your children about these predators is crucial. Make them aware of the tactics these individuals employ, such as appearing overly friendly or empathetic. Let them know that predators will go to any length to appear younger and more relatable.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/reports-of-online-predator-on-the-rise-how-to-keep-your-kids-safe/\">Reports of Online Predators on the Rise. How to Keep Your Kids Safe</a></p>\n<h2>Starting the Conversation with Kids</h2>\n<p>Addressing such a sensitive issue with your children can be challenging but necessary. Start by discussing cases like Nicole&#8217;s, focusing not only on the tragic outcome but also on the lead-up events and why she may have developed such a strong online connection. Discussing how innocent online friendships can spiral into dangerous situations can be an excellent eye-opener for your kids.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial to teach your kids to look out for strangers who are &#8220;too friendly&#8221; or excessively understanding. Tell them that predators keep themselves updated with the latest movies, music, and trends to seem younger and easily start conversations with children. Remember, predators will say anything to appear more youthful than they actually are.</p>\n<h2>Red Flags and Warning Signs&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t always know what your children are doing online. Their <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/digital-footprints-privacy-concerns/\">digital footprints</a> could be anywhere. That&rsquo;s why it is imperative to understand the red flags and warning signs that may signal a hazardous online interaction, especially when they already encounter a predator, and you&rsquo;re still in the shadow.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Identifying Suspicious Behavior in Online Contacts:</b> Your children should be cautious if someone they&#8217;re communicating with online excessively flatters them, evades questions about their identity, provides inconsistent information, or repeatedly pushes boundaries. Isolation attempts, where the contact discourages your child from discussing the interaction with others or emphasizes secrecy, should raise concerns.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Recognizing Signs of Manipulation and Coercion</b>: Online predators often employ manipulative tactics to gain control over their targets. Your child should be aware of emotional manipulation, blackmail, and threats, all signs of coercion. Predators may work to build false trust by pretending to be the only one who cares about or understands the child. If the contact insists on secrecy, isolates your child from real-world activities, or uses emotional manipulation, it&#8217;s crucial for your child to recognize these tactics and take them seriously. And you, as a parent, should acknowledge your child&rsquo;s behavior when they&rsquo;re being emotionally manipulated.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Understanding When to Seek Help or Report Concerning Interactions: </b>Open communication is crucial to your child&#8217;s safety. Encourage them to talk to you about any concerns regarding their online interactions. Help your child trust their instincts; if something doesn&#8217;t feel right or makes them uncomfortable, they should share those feelings with a trusted adult. Ensure they know how to report concerning interactions on the platforms they use and don&#8217;t hesitate to involve law enforcement if you suspect contact with an online predator. In some cases, seeking professional help may also be necessary to support your child&#8217;s recovery from a traumatic online experience. Building a foundation of trust and proactive communication is essential for online safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Teaching Kids to Guard their Online Presence</h2>\n<p>Reinforcing the importance of online privacy is a crucial step in protecting your kids from virtual predators. Teach your children that personal information such as their full name, address, school, and phone number should never be shared online. They must also understand that specific images and details about their life can also reveal too much to an online predator. Remind them to limit geotagged photos as this can expose their location, and also to strictly control who is able to view their social media accounts.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/mobile-and-iot-security/location-sharing-apps/\">Why You Should Think Before Geotagging that Selfie</a></p>\n<p>Explain to your kids the dangers of accepting friend requests or communicating with strangers online. Make them aware that individuals posing as children or teenagers could be adults with malicious intent. Reinforce that anyone who asks them to keep a conversation secret or requests for personal information or inappropriate content is a potential danger, and they should inform you immediately if this occurs.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/making-online-safety-a-priority-for-our-tech-savvy-children/\">Making Online Safety a Priority for Our Tech-Savvy Children</a></p>\n<h2>Implementing Online Safety Measures</h2>\n<p>As parents, we must stay informed about our children&rsquo;s online activities, which goes far beyond just asking them about it. This can involve regularly reviewing their social media profiles and friends lists and ensuring they only interact with people they know personally. Familiarize yourself with the platforms and apps your children use to comprehend their functionalities and potential risks better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creating house rules regarding internet use can be an effective measure to ensure online safety. This could involve having specific periods when the internet can be used, limiting the time spent online, and setting out where internet-access devices can be used. For instance, allowing internet use only in common areas instead of bedrooms can be a good practice. It is essential to have ongoing dialogues about these rules and their reasons so your children can understand and appreciate their importance.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>In an age where the online world is a significant part of our children&rsquo;s lives, online safety education is essential. It&rsquo;s crucial that, as parents, caregivers, and mentors, we take proactive steps to protect our children from the pervasive threat of online predators. This means having open and ongoing conversations about the real dangers that can lurk behind a screen, teaching kids to guard their online presence, and implementing online safety measures. Together, we can ensure the internet becomes safer for our children to learn, explore, and connect with others.

These scams often involve leveraging popular search queries to trap unsuspecting netizens into their malicious schemes. Among the top searches in the online world, celebrities hold a prime spot. Through this guide, we aim to shed light on how scammers take advantage of the global fascination with celebrities to target their potential victims.</p>\n<p>As digital users, most of us are likely well-acquainted with the phrase &#8220;Just Google it.&#8221; The search engine has become a go-to source for any information ranging from essential daily needs to entertainment gossip. But it&#8217;s crucial to remember that while you&#8217;re in pursuit of data, scammers are in search of their next victim.</p>\n<h2>Celebrity Bait: The Evolution of Modern Scams</h2>\n<p>Scammers have significantly evolved with the advancement of technology. They&#8217;ve mastered the art of creating fake or infected websites that can harm your computer systems, extract your financial information, or even steal your identity. Their strategies often include luring victims through popular searches, such as the latest Twitter trends, breaking news stories, major world events, downloads, or even celebrity images and gossip. The higher the popularity of the search, the greater the risk of encountering harmful results.</p>\n<p>McAfee has conducted <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/mcafee-labs.html\">research</a> for six consecutive years on popular celebrities to reveal which ones are riskiest to search for online. For instance, Emma Watson outplaced Heidi Klum as the most dangerous celebrity to look up online. Interestingly, it was the first year that the top 10 list comprised solely of women. Cybercriminals commonly exploit the names of such popular celebrities to lead users to websites loaded with malicious software, consequently turning an innocent search for videos or pictures into a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a>-infected nightmare.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/emma-watson-facebook-virus/\">Emma Watson Video Scam: Hackers Use Celeb&rsquo;s Popularity to Unleash Viruses&nbsp;</a></p>\n<h2>The Lure of &#8220;Free&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Scammers are well aware of the allure the word &#8220;free&#8221; holds for most Internet users. They cleverly exploit this to get your attention and draw you into their traps. For instance, when you search for &ldquo;Beyonce&rdquo; or &ldquo;Taylor Swift&rdquo; followed by prompts like &ldquo;free downloads&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beyonce concert photos&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Taylor Swift leaked songs&rdquo;, you expose yourself to potential online threats aiming to steal your personal information.

Using common sense, double-checking URLs, utilizing safe search plugins, and having comprehensive security software are some strategies to help ensure your online safety. This guide aims to provide you with insights and tools to navigate the online world without falling prey to its many hidden dangers.</p>\n<h2>Practical Tips To Guard Against Celebrity Scams</h2>\n<p>Truth be told, the responsibility for online safety lies primarily with the user. Just as you would not walk into any shady-looking place in real life, it requires a similar instinct to avoid shady sites while browsing online. One important piece of advice &#8211; if something appears too good to be true, in all probability, it is. So, take note of these practical tips to help you guard against celebrity scams and other online threats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Exercise Skepticism:</b> The first line of defense against online scams is skepticism. If something seems too good to be true, chances are it probably is. Be highly cautious when encountering online content that promises unbelievable giveaways, jaw-dropping discounts, or exclusive access to celebrities. Scammers often use these enticing offers to lure unsuspecting victims.</li>\n<li><b>Inspect Web Addresses:</b> Take a careful look at the web address you are directed to. For instance, if you are searching for Amazon.com but are taken to &ldquo;Amazzon.cn,&rdquo; be alert. This could be a phishing site looking to steal your information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-if-website-is-safe/\">How to Tell Whether a Website Is Safe or Unsafe</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Install Safe Search Plugins:</b> To bolster your online safety, consider installing safe search plugins such as <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html\">McAfee Web Advisor</a> software. These plugins integrate with your web browser and provide real-time safety ratings for websites that appear in your search results.

Look for verified badges or check marks that indicate the account is genuine. Celebrities often have official accounts that are authenticated by the platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Stay informed about common online scams and tactics used by cybercriminals. Knowledge is a powerful defense. Familiarize yourself with the latest scams and phishing techniques to recognize and avoid potential threats.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regularly Update Software:</strong> Keep your operating system, web browsers, and security software up to date.

Good <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">antivirus software</a>&nbsp;can protect against the latest threats, alert you about unsafe websites, and even detect phishing attempts. Furthermore, always keep your security software and all other software updated.

While hacking and social engineering might seem like concepts only prevalent in big-screen thrillers, the truth is they occur more frequently than we&#8217;d like to admit. Your email address, innocuous as it may seem, is often one of the gateways into your digital persona. This article aims to shed light on the potential dangers and impacts of giving away your email address to the wrong people.</p>\n<p>To offer a real-life perspective, we&#8217;ll follow a conversation with an ethical hacker called &#8216;Oz.&#8217; Ethical hackers, or &#8216;white hat&#8217; hackers, are those who use their hacking skills to uncover security vulnerabilities and help implement protective measures against other malevolent hackers, known as &#8216;black hat&#8217; hackers. Despite Oz&#8217;s assurance that he belongs to the white hat category, the following discourse will reveal how much information a hacker can come across based solely on your email address.</p>\n<p>&rarr;<b> Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/are-all-hackers-bad/\">Are All Hackers Bad?</a></p>\n<h2>Communication with Oz: An Eye-Opener</h2>\n<p>Initiating communication with Oz took a toll on my nerves, considering the potential threat to my data privacy. For communication, Oz suggested using an email address, prompting me to create a separate email account solely for our conversations. Once the lines of communication were established, I posed my first question: &#8220;Suppose we met at a coffee shop, exchanged pleasantries, and all I left you with was my email address. What kind of information could you gather about me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>An hour later, Oz responded with my work and home phone numbers, home address, birth date, and year. But the real shocker was a casual remark about my meeting with Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, followed by a link to a picture I had no memory of sharing publicly. On clicking the link, I received another email from Oz, stating that he had discovered my preferred internet browser, my operating system, and my <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/do-i-need-to-hide-my-ip-address/\">IP address</a>, essentially knowing my geographical coordinates. At this point, it became crystal clear just how much information a hacker can unearth based on an email address alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Importance of Online Safety</h2>\n<p>The experience with Oz was a stark reminder of the importance of online safety. We often let our guards down, readily providing information and clicking on links without giving it a second thought. However, this is exactly the kind of behavior that hackers rely on for their activities. It is crucial to remember that the internet is a public space, and every piece of information we share can potentially be accessed and misused by malicious parties.</p>\n<p>In the next sections of this guide, we&#8217;ll delve deeper into the mechanisms hackers use to derive information from an email and the measures you can take to secure your digital identity. The aim is to provide you with practical steps to ensure your online safety and maintain your privacy in the digital world.</p>\n<h2>The Mechanism Behind The Hacks</h2>\n<p>When you give out your email address to a hacker, they have a significant amount of information at their fingertips. Understanding the mechanisms that hackers employ to exploit your online presence is essential to appreciate the gravity of the online safety challenge. When a hacker gains access to your email address, they effectively open the door to a wealth of information about you. Let&#8217;s find out how this works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Reverse Email Lookup</b>: The first step for a hacker after acquiring your email address is often to perform a &#8216;reverse email lookup.&#8217; This process involves using your email address to trace any associated social media accounts. Many individuals use the same email address for various online platforms, making it relatively easy for hackers to link your digital footprint across different sites. Once they&#8217;ve identified your social media profiles, they can glean valuable insights into your personal life, interests, and potentially even more sensitive information you&#8217;ve chosen to share publicly on these platforms.</li>\n<li><b>Email-Tracking Apps:</b> Hackers can employ sophisticated email-tracking applications or techniques to gather even more information. These tools are designed to surreptitiously monitor your email interactions.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>IP Address Tracking:</b> When you open an email, it often contains hidden elements that reveal your IP address. This information can be used to determine your approximate geographical location. Hackers can gain insights into where you are located, potentially compromising your physical safety or facilitating further cyberattacks.</li>\n<li><b>Activity Monitoring:</b> Email-tracking apps can notify the hacker when you open the email, providing them with a timestamp of your activity. This information can be used to deduce when you are most active online, which can be exploited for phishing attacks or other malicious activities.</li>\n<li><b>Link Interaction Tracking: </b>By embedding tracking pixels or unique links within emails, hackers can discern which links you click on and even monitor your actions on linked web pages. This level of surveillance allows them to understand your interests, preferences, and potential vulnerabilities. In the case of the Oz experiment, clicking on what appeared to be a harmless link had far-reaching consequences, as the hacker was able to monitor subsequent online behavior, leading to the exposure of additional personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr;<b> Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/mobile-spyware/\">Mobile Spyware: How Hackers Can Turn Your Phone Into a Stalking Machine</a></p>\n<p>Knowing these tactics highlights the importance of practicing caution and diligence when it comes to email and online interactions. Safeguarding your digital identity requires a combination of awareness, security measures, and privacy-conscious practices. It also underscores the need for robust cybersecurity measures on both individual and organizational levels to protect against these types of intrusive and potentially harmful activities.</p>\n<p><b>Protecting Your Digital Identity</b></p>\n<p>Knowing all this, it is imperative to find ways to protect yourself from such intrusions. In addition to knowing what makes hackers tick, there are several insights and practices you should consider to enhance your online security and privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Strong Passwords: </b>Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.</li>\n<li><b>Two-Factor or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): </b>Enable <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">2FA or MFA</a> wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide two or more forms of verification, such as a password and a fingerprint or a one-time code sent to your phone.</li>\n<li><b>Regular Updates: </b>Keep your operating system, software, and antivirus programs up to date. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are often patched in these updates, so failing to update can leave you exposed.</li>\n<li><b>Phishing Awareness:</b> Educate yourself about phishing scams. Be wary of emails or messages requesting sensitive information, especially if they urge you to act urgently. Double-check the legitimacy of such requests with the supposed sender through a different channel of communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr;<b> Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/spot-phishing-lures/\">How to Spot Phishing Lures</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Secure Wi-Fi:</b> Ensure your home Wi-Fi network is password-protected and uses strong encryption. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities unless you are using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">VPN</a> (Virtual Private Network) for added security.</li>\n<li><b>Regular Backups:</b> Back up your important data regularly, and store backups offline or in the cloud. In case of a ransomware attack or data loss, you&#8217;ll have a safe copy of your information.</li>\n<li><b>Social Engineering Awareness:</b> Be cautious about what you share on social media. Cybercriminals often gather information from social profiles to craft convincing spear-phishing attacks. Limit the personal information you make public.</li>\n<li><b>Email Verification:</b> Verify email senders, especially when dealing with financial or sensitive matters. Look out for red flags such as misspellings or suspicious email addresses.</li>\n<li><b>Safe Browsing Habits: </b>Avoid visiting dubious websites or downloading files from untrusted sources. Use ad-blockers and ensure that your web browser settings are configured for enhanced privacy and security.</li>\n<li><b>Security Software:</b> In addition to antivirus software, consider using anti-malware and anti-spyware programs to bolster your defense against various types of threats. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html\">McAfee+</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\">McAfee Total Protection</a> are your best options if you want to have an all-inclusive software security.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Cybersecurity Education</b>: Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices.

This adjustment involves much more than just allowing employees to access work resources from various locations. It necessitates the update of remote working policies and heightened cybersecurity security awareness.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals and potential nation-states are reportedly exploiting the global health crisis for their own gain. Hackers have targeted an array of sectors, including healthcare, employing COVID-19-related baits to manipulate user behavior. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how you, as an employee, can augment your cybersecurity measures and stay safe when working remotely.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Threat Landscape</h2>\n<p>It has been reported that criminals are using COVID-19 as bait in <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/\">phishing emails</a>, domains, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\">malware</a>, and more. While the exploitation of this global crisis is disheartening, it is unsurprising as criminals habitually leverage large events to their advantage. That said, it&#8217;s crucial to identify potential targets, particularly in certain geographic regions.</p>\n<p>The data so far reveals a broad geographic dispersion of &#8216;targets,&#8217; with many countries that are typical phishing targets being hit. However, there are anomalies such as Panama, Taiwan, and Japan, suggesting possible campaigns targeting specific countries. The landscape is continuously evolving as more threats are identified, necessitating vigilant monitoring on your part to stay safe.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-labs-report-reveals-latest-covid-19-threats-and-malware-surges/\">McAfee Labs Report Reveals Latest COVID-19 Threats and Malware Surges</a></p>\n<h2>Contextualizing Working from Home Threats</h2>\n<p>The abrupt shift to remote work has left many employees unprepared, with some needing to operate from personal devices. These personal devices, if lacking appropriate security measures, can expose both you and your company or employer to various potential attacks.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, there has been a surge in targeted <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/ransomware/\">ransomware attacks</a>, particularly through &ldquo;commodity malware.&rdquo; This malware type is often directed at consumers. Consequently, accessing work networks from potentially infected personal devices without appropriate security measures significantly increases the risk. Both employees and employers are left vulnerable to breaches and ransomware lockdowns.</p>\n<h2>Know the Risks of Online Connectivity and Collaboration</h2>\n<p>Office closures and working-from-home mandates due to COVID-19 permanently changed the way we look at workplace connectivity. A recent <a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/top-work-at-home-privacy-and-security-54930/\">Fenwick poll</a> among HR, privacy, and security professionals across industries noted that approximately 90% of employees now handle intellectual property, confidential, and personal information on their in-home Wi-Fi as opposed to in-office networks. Additionally, many are accessing this information on personal and mobile devices that often do not have the same protections as company-owned devices. The elevated number of unprotected devices connected to unsecured networks creates weak areas in a company&rsquo;s infrastructure, making it harder to protect against hackers.</p>\n<p>One technology your organization should be especially diligent about is video conferencing software. Hackers can infiltrate video conferencing software to eavesdrop on private discussions and steal vital information. Many disrupt video calls via brute force, where they scan a list of possible meeting IDs to try and connect to a meeting. Others seek more complex infiltration methods through vulnerabilities in the actual software. Up until recently, Agora&rsquo;s video conferencing software exhibited these same vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Hackers will usually try to gain access to these network vulnerabilities by targeting unsuspecting employees through phishing scams which can lead to even greater consequences if they manage to insert malware or hold your data for ransom. Without proper training on how to avoid these threats, many employees wouldn&rsquo;t know how to handle the impact should they become the target.</p>\n<h2>Remote Working: Best Practices</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an employee working remotely, it is essential to comprehend and adhere to best security practices. Here are some guidelines you could follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Remote Working Policy Guidance:</b> Understand clearly what the remote working expectations of your company are, especially with respect to security practices.</li>\n<li><b>Asset Classification:</b> With added security, make previously inaccessible information available for remote use.</li>\n<li><b>Strong Authentication:</b> Secure access to key assets using <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">two-factor authentication</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Awareness:</b> Be informed about the potential risks of connecting remotely and the need to exercise caution while accessing authorized shared services and handling targeted phishing emails.</li>\n<li><b>VPN Access:</b> Use <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a> for a secure connection from untrusted networks.</li>\n<li><b>Regular Software Updates:</b> Ensure that your operating system, software applications, and security tools are regularly updated with the latest patches and updates.

Day</a>. Started in 2009, it’s an Australian non-profit suicide prevention that is all about having conversations with others to address social isolation and promote a sense of community. What I love the most, is that RUOK? Day has become quite an event on the Australian calendar. You’d be hard-pressed to find a workplace that doesn’t host a morning tea or a retailer that’s not selling a ribbon or badge in support of the day. In my opinion, it has given many of us the confidence to talk about mental health and that, my friends, is a very good thing!</p>\n<p><strong>When You’re Not Feeling OK</strong></p>\n<p>You wouldn’t be human if you hadn’t ever felt a little down or anxious. It’s the natural ebb and flow of daily life. However, if these symptoms are hanging around and are affecting your ability to ‘do’ life then, it’s time to take some action.</p>\n<p>Remember, it is incredibly common for someone to experience a dip in their mental health. <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/mental-health/topic-areas/mental-illness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recent research shows that over 2 in 5 Aussies aged 16 to 85 will experience a mental disorder at some time in their life</a>, with 1 in 5, experiencing a mental disorder in the previous 12 months.</p>\n<p>If you’re not feeling OK, the most important thing to remember is that you do not need to deal with this all by yourself. Sometimes when you’re feeling really low, the thought of leaving the house and facing the world can feel too much. I totally get it! And that’s where the online world can play a huge role. There is an abundance of resources available online for anyone who needs mental health support which makes it so much easier to get the help you need when facing the world just feel a bit much.</p>\n<p><strong>Where To Go Online When You’re Not Feeling OK</strong></p>\n<p>Here is a list of organisations that offer online mental health services here in Australia. This list is not exhaustive however these are the most commonly used, and hence best funded, support services. If you are based in the US, please find details at the end of the post for organisations that can provide mental health support.</p>\n<p><strong>When Things Are Pretty Dire</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Suicide Call-Back Service</a> offers free professional 24/7 counselling support to Aussies at risk of suicide, concerned about someone at risk, affected by suicide as well as people experiencing emotional or mental health issues.

They offer a free 24/7 confidential one to one counselling service that can help you in a crisis. You can, of course, choose to speak to someone on the telephone (13 11 14) but you also have the option of either <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/crisis-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">messaging</a> or texting (0477 13 11 14) with a counsellor also.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond Blue</a> is another great Aussie mental health and wellbeing support service that can help in an emergency.

You can also access support if you are an adult supporting a young person. Since it was established in 1991, the service has supported over 8.5 million people. The service offers everything from life-saving crisis intervention through to emotional support when young people just need someone to listen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://headspace.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headspace</a> is Australia’s Mental Health Young Foundation.

This is not a crisis service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://friendline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Friendline</a> is a telephone and chat support service for anyone who&#8217;s feeling lonely, needs to reconnect or just wants a chat.

This is not a crisis service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MensLine Australia</a> is a professional telephone and online counselling service offering support to Australian men 24 hours/7days a week. Whether it’s addiction issues, domestic violence, anxiety or depression, the service is able to offer support on 1300 78 99 or via <a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/phone-and-online-counselling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online or video chat</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.openarms.gov.au/get-support/suicide-intervention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Arms</a> – Veterans and Families Counselling provides 24/7 free and confidential telephone and webchat counselling to anyone who has served at least one day in the Australian Defence Force, their partner, and their families. It isn’t a crisis service, but it can offer ongoing mental health treatment and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if you are not just yourself at the moment and are feeling really low – or you know someone that is – please know that there is help available online 24/7. So, make yourself a cuppa and get started because you are not alone.</p>\n<p>Alex xx</p>\n<p>P.S.

But their favorite type of cookie is of the browser variety.</p>\n<p>Browser cookies – often just referred to as cookies – track your comings and goings on websites. And when a cyber thief gets their mitts on your browser cookies, it can open all kinds of doors into your online accounts.</p>\n<p>The first step to protecting your devices and online privacy from criminals is to understand their schemes. Here are the key terms you need to know about cookie theft plus how to keep malicious software off your devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Cookie Theft Terms You Should Know</strong></p>\n<p>Cookie theft can happen to anyone. Knowing the basics of this cyberscheme may help you better protect your online life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Browser cookie.</strong> A small collection of data your internet browser stores every time you visit a website. When your browser stores this data, it makes it quicker for you to log back into a website or for a website to customize its suggestions for you the next time you visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Cache.</strong> Like a mouse scurrying away a pile of sweet treats, your device hoards – or caches – all the cookies you gather from websites you visit. Your cache of cookies will grow continually until you clear it out. If your cache grows too large, it could slow down your device, affect performance, or tax your battery power.</li>\n<li><strong>Multifactor authentication</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MFA</a> is a way to log in to an online account that requires additional forms of identification beyond a username and password. It could require biometric identification (like a face or fingerprint scan), a security question, or a one-time code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How and Why Do Criminals Steal Browser Cookies?</strong></p>\n<p>Cookies thieves are generally motivated by the financial gains of breaking into people’s online accounts. Banking, social media, and online shopping accounts are full of valuable personal and financial details that a cybercriminal can either sell on the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-the-dark-web-the-answer-can-help-you-stay-safer-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dark web</a> or use to impersonate you and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steal your identity</a>.</p>\n<p>Malware is generally the vehicle cybercriminals use to steal cookies. Once the malicious software gets onto a device, the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malware</a> is trained to copy a new cookie’s data and send it to the cybercriminal. Then, from their own machine, the cybercriminal can input that data and start a new session with the target’s stolen data.</p>\n<p>There was a stretch of a few years where cookie thieves targeted high-profile YouTube influencers with malware spread through fake collaboration deals and crypto scams. The criminals’ goal was to steal cookies to sneak into the backend of the YouTube accounts to change passwords, recovery emails and phone numbers, and bypass two-factor authentication to lock the influencers out of their accounts.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>But you don’t have to have a valuable social media account to draw the eye of a cybercriminal. “Operation Cookie Monster” dismantled an online forum that sold stolen login information for millions of online accounts gained through cookie theft.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Best Practices for Secure Browsing</strong></p>\n<p>To keep your internet cookies out of the hands of criminals, it’s essential to practice safe browsing habits. These four tips will go a long way toward keeping your accounts out of the reach of cookie thieves and your devices free from malicious software.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set up MFA.</strong> MFA may seem like it’ll slow down your login process, but really, the extra seconds it takes are well worth it. Most people have their phone within arm’s reach throughout the day, so a texted, emailed, or authentication app-generated code is easy enough to access. Just remember that a reputable company will never ask you for one-time codes, so these codes are for your eyes only. MFA makes it extremely difficult for a criminal to log into your accounts, even when they have your password and username. Without the unique code, a bad actor is locked out.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch out for phishing attempts and risky websites. </strong>Cookie-stealing malware often hops onto innocent devices through either phishing lures or through <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-whether-a-website-is-safe-or-unsafe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visiting untrustworthy sites</a>. Make sure to carefully read every text, email, and social media direct message. With the help of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpt-a-scammers-newest-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI content generation tools like ChatGPT</a>, phishers’ messages are more believable than they were years ago. Be especially diligent about clicking on links that may take you to risky sites or download malicious files onto your device.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear your cache regularly.</strong> Make it a habit to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-cache/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clear your cache</a> and browsing history often. This is a great practice to optimize the performance of your device. Plus, in the case that a cybercriminal does install cookie-stealing malware on your device, if you store hardly any cookies on your device, the thief will have little valuable information to pilfer.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> While a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> won’t protect your device from cookie-stealing malware, it will lessen your dependence upon storing valuable cookies. It’s convenient to already have your usernames and passwords auto-populate; however, if your device falls into the wrong hands these shortcuts could spell trouble for your privacy. A password manager is a vault for all your login information for your dozens of online accounts. All you need to do is input one master password, and from there, the password manager will autofill your logins. It’s just as quick and convenient, but infinitely more secure.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Lock Up Your Cookie Jar</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a> is an excellent partner to help you secure your devices and digital life. McAfee+ includes a safe browsing tool to alert you to suspicious websites, a password manager, identity monitoring, and more.</p>\n<p>The next time you enjoy a cookie, spare a moment to think of cookies of the digital flavor: clear your cache if you haven’t in awhile, doublecheck your devices and online accounts for suspicious activity, and savor the sweetness of your digital privacy!</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>The Hacker News, “<a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/hackers-stealing-browser-cookies-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hackers Stealing Browser Cookies to Hijack High-Profile YouTube Accounts</a>”</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>CNN, “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/politics/genesis-market-fbi-seizure/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Operation Cookie Monster:’ FBI seizes popular cybercrime forum used for large-scale identity theft</a>”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/cookie-theft-how-to-keep-cybercriminals-out-of-your-accounts/\">Cookie Theft: How to Keep Cybercriminals Out of Your Accounts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How Typosquatting Scams Work","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/typosquatting-need-know-now/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 16:00:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"malware"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/?p=88400"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/300x200_Blog_090823.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/300x200_Blog_090823.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/300x200_Blog_090823-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Your teacher was right.

Spelling counts, particularly to scammers.</p>\n<p>Enter the world of typosquatting scams. Also known as URL hijacking, typosquatting scams target internet users who incorrectly type a website address into their web browser.</p>\n<p>Scammers have long used typosquatting techniques to capture traffic from those butterfingers moments we all have when typing on our keyboards. And the butterthumbs moments on our phones.</p>\n<p>For example, say you type “websiteaddresss dot-com” instead of “websiteaddress dot-com.” More than just a mistake, a mistyped address might land you on a malicious site designed to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/5-common-types-of-identity-theft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steal personal information</a>, make money, or <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spread malware</a>.</p>\n<p>The scam sites you might land on vary. Some serve up a screenload of spammy ads. Others host malicious download links, and yet more lead to stores full of cheap, knockoff goods. In other cases, scammers take it up a notch. We’ve seen typosquatting sites evolve into clever copycats of legitimate sites. Some look like real banking and e-commerce sites that they steal traffic from, complete with stolen logos and familiar login screens. With this, scammers hope to trick you into entering your passwords and other sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Companies are well aware of this practice. Many purchase URLs with those common misspellings and redirect them to their proper sites. Further, many brands put up anti-fraud pages on their sites that list the legitimate addresses they use to contact customers. Here at McAfee, we have an <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/cyber-scam/customer-scam-awareness.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anti-fraud center</a> of our own.</p>\n<p>The fact remains, people make mistakes. And that can lead to risky scam sites. However, you can still avoid typosquatting attacks quite easily.</p>\n<h2><strong>The big business of typosquatting</strong></h2>\n<p>For starters, it helps to know that typosquatting is often big business. In many cases, larger cybercrime organizations set up entire flights of malicious sites that can number into the dozens to the hundreds.</p>\n<p>Let’s check out a few examples and see just how sophisticated typosquatting scams can be:</p>\n<h3><strong>“dot.cm” scams</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/omitting-the-o-in-com-could-be-costly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">researchers found</a> a host of addresses that were registered in the names of well-known sites, but ending in  “.cm”, instead of “.com”. These copycat addresses included financial websites, such as “Chase dot-cm” and “Citicards dot-cm,” as well as social and streaming sites.</p>\n<p>Scammers used the .cm sites to advertise promotions and surveys used to collect users’ personal information. What’s more, more than 1,500 of them were registered to the same email address, indicating that someone was trying to turn typosquatting into a serious business.</p>\n<h3><strong>“dot.om” scams</strong></h3>\n<p>Similarly, 2016 saw the advent of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Endgame/what-does-oman-the-house-of-cards-and-typosquatting-have-in-common-4d1225b7870\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malicious dot-om sites</a>, that mimicked big names like “linkedin dot-om” and “walgreens dot-om.” Even the interesting typo found in “youtubec dot-om” cropped up. Of note, single entities registered these sites in batches. Researchers found that individuals or companies registered anywhere from 18 to 96 of them. Again, signs of serious business.</p>\n<h3><strong>Big brand and voice assistant typosquatting scams</strong></h3>\n<p>Recently, security researchers further found an increase in the number of typosquatting sites. An increase of 10% from 2021 to 2022. These sites mimic popular app stores, Microsoft addresses, services like TikTok, Snapchat, PayPal, and on and on.</p>\n<p>Further, scammers have gotten wise to the increased use of personal assistants to look up web addresses on phones and in homes. Typosquatting now includes soundalike names in addition to lookalike names. With that, they can capitalize when an assistant doesn’t quite hear a command properly.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to protect yourself from typosquatting</strong></h2>\n<p>No doubt, slip-ups happen when browsing.

For example,</p>\n<p>&#8220;kern!&#8221;.Replace(&#8220;!&#8221;, &#8220;el32&#8221;)  à  kernel32</p>\n<p>Class1.hU0H4qUiSpCA13feW0(&#8220;qllocEx&#8221;, &#8220;q&#8221;, &#8220;VirtualA&#8221;) à VirtualAllocEx</p>\n<p>As a result, these functions translate into the subsequent API calls:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>CreateProcessA : </strong>This API call is typically employed to initiate the creation of a new process, rather than for process injection. In the context of process injection, the focus is generally on targeting an existing process and injecting code into it.</li>\n<li><strong>VirtualAllocEx</strong>: This is often used in process injection to allocate memory within the target process to host the injected code.</li>\n<li><strong>ReadProcessMemory</strong>: This is used to read the memory of a target process. It is typically used in reflective DLL injection to read the contents of a DLL from the injector&#8217;s memory and write it into the target process.</li>\n<li><strong>GetThreadContext</strong>: This API is used to retrieve the context (registers, flags, etc.) of a thread within a target process. It&#8217;s useful for modifying thread execution flow during injection.</li>\n<li><strong>Wow64GetThreadContext</strong>: This is like GetThreadContext, but it&#8217;s used when dealing with 32-bit processes on a 64-bit system.</li>\n<li><strong>SetThreadContext</strong>: This API is used to set the context of a thread within a target process. This can be useful for modifying the execution flow.</li>\n<li><strong>Wow64SetThreadContext</strong>: Like SetThreadContext, but for 32-bit processes on a 64-bit system.</li>\n<li><strong>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</strong>: This is used to unmap a section of a process&#8217;s virtual address space, which could potentially be used to remove a DLL loaded into a target process during injection.</li>\n<li><strong>WriteProcessMemory</strong>: This is used to write data into the memory of a target process.

Agent Tesla targets the following email clients to gather data:</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174182 size-full\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mail-clients.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1020\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mail-clients.png 1020w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mail-clients-300x81.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mail-clients-768x208.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mail-clients-205x55.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 23: Mail clients</em></p>\n<h2><strong>Exfiltration:</strong></h2>\n<p>Agent Tesla employs significant obfuscation techniques to evade initial static analysis attempts. This strategy conceals its malicious code and actual objectives. Upon successful decoding, we were able to scrutinize its internal operations and functionalities, including the use of SMTP for data exfiltration.</p>\n<p>The observed sample utilizes SMTP as its chosen method of exfiltration. This protocol is frequently favored due to its minimal overhead demands on the attacker. SMTP reduces overhead for attackers because it is efficient, widely allowed in networks, uses existing infrastructure, causes minimal anomalies, leverages compromised accounts, and appears less suspicious compared to other protocols. A single compromised email account can be used for exfiltration, streamlining the process, and minimizing the need for complex setups. They can achieve their malicious goals with just a single email account, simplifying their operations.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-174196 size-large\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-1024x615.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-1024x615.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-300x180.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-768x462.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration.-205x123.png 205w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Function-calls-made-for-exfiltration..png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 24: Function calls made for exfiltration.</em></p>\n<p>This is the procedure by which functions are invoked to facilitate data extraction via SMTP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A specific value is provided as a parameter, and this value is processed within the functions.

This orchestrated sequence highlights how the malware establishes a connection through SMTP, facilitating its intended operations.</p>\n<p>Following these steps, the malware efficiently establishes a login using acquired credentials. Once authenticated, it commences the process of transmitting the harvested data to a designated email address associated with the malware itself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Summary</strong><strong>:</strong></h3>\n<p>The infection process of Agent Tesla involves multiple stages. It begins with the initial vector, often using email attachments or other social engineering tactics. Once executed, the malware employs obfuscation to avoid detection during static analysis. The malware then undergoes decoding, revealing its true functionality. It orchestrates a sequence of PowerShell commands to download and process a hidden image containing encoded instructions. These instructions lead to the extraction of a .NET DLL file, which subsequently injects the final payload into the legitimate process &#8216;RegAsm.exe&#8217; using a series of API calls for process injection. This payload carries out its purpose of data theft, including targeting browsers and email clients for sensitive information. The stolen data is exfiltrated via SMTP communication, providing stealth and leveraging email accounts. Overall, Agent Tesla&#8217;s infection process employs a complex chain of techniques to achieve its data-stealing objectives.</p>\n<h3><strong>Indicators of compromise (IoC):</strong></h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"75\"><strong>File</strong></td>\n<td width=\"174\"><strong>MD5</strong></td>\n<td width=\"374\"><strong>SHA256</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"75\"><strong>VBS file</strong></td>\n<td width=\"174\">e2a4a40fe8c8823ed5a73cdc9a8fa9b9</td>\n<td width=\"374\">e7a157ba1819d7af9a5f66aa9e161cce68d20792d117a90332ff797cbbd8aaa5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"75\"><strong>JPEG file</strong></td>\n<td width=\"174\">ec8dfde2126a937a65454323418e28da</td>\n<td width=\"374\">21c5d3ef06d8cff43816a10a37ba1804a764b7b31fe1eb3b82c144515297875f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"75\"><strong>DLL file</strong></td>\n<td width=\"174\">b257f83495996b9a79d174d60dc02caa</td>\n<td width=\"374\">b2d667caa6f3deec506e27a5f40971cb344b6edcfe6182002f1e91ce9167327f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"75\"><strong>Final payload</strong></td>\n<td width=\"174\">dd94daef4081f63cf4751c3689045213</td>\n<td width=\"374\">abe5c5bb02865ac405e08438642fcd0d38abd949a18341fc79d2e8715f0f6e42</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Table 1:Indicators of Compromise</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/agent-teslas-unique-approach-vbs-and-steganography-for-delivery-and-intrusion/\">Agent Tesla&#8217;s Unique Approach: VBS and Steganography for Delivery and Intrusion</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Spyware: A Major Identity Theft Threat","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/spyware-a-major-identity-theft-threat/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 23:56:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Family Safety"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"malware"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"http://blogs.mcafee.com/?p=8540"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_Mobile-Spyware.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_Mobile-Spyware.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_Mobile-Spyware-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Spyware is a type of malicious software that collects information about users without their knowledge.

They monitor and record your activities, thus posing a significant threat to your <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/digital-footprints-privacy-concerns/\">digital privacy</a>, security, and identity. Spyware can lead to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\">identity theft</a> if your personal or financial data falls into the wrong hands. This guide provides in-depth information about spyware, how it works, and how to prevent it from infecting your computer system.</p>\n<h2>What Is Spyware?</h2>\n<p>Spyware is a type of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-to-quickly-remove-malware/\">malicious software</a> that collects information about users without their knowledge. It can track every action, from keystrokes to browsing habits, thus presenting a grave threat to user privacy and security.</p>\n<p>Designed to be stealthy and elusive, spyware can record every keystroke, capture screenshots, and even record audio and video, making it a potent tool for cybercriminals. It is often transmitted through free downloads, file-sharing programs, or deceptive links and websites.</p>\n<h2>Spyware &ndash; A Legal and Illegal Aspects</h2>\n<p>In certain situations, spyware is perfectly legal. For example, when the owner of the computer installs and uses the software, it&#8217;s considered legal. Parents might install spyware to monitor their children&#8217;s online activities or employers to oversee their employees&#8217; productivity.</p>\n<p>However, when someone installs spyware on a computer without the owner&#8217;s consent, it becomes illegal. Cybercriminals often disguise spyware as legitimate programs or embed them in websites, tricking users into downloading or clicking, resulting in the stealthy installation of spyware.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/malware-hides-in-installer-to-avoid-detection/\">Malware Hides in Installer to Avoid Detection</a></p>\n<h2>Common Forms of Spyware</h2>\n<p>Spyware can take several shapes and forms, and its diversity makes it even more dangerous. A common form of spyware is a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-keylogger/\">keylogger</a> or a keycatcher. This hardware can be attached to a computer to capture and record keystrokes. This device can monitor user activity without being detected by typical anti-spyware software.</p>\n<p>Spyware can also come in the form of a computer virus. When users click on a malicious link or download a corrupted program, they unknowingly install spyware on their system. Once installed, the spyware works silently in the background, capturing and transmitting user data to the attacker.</p>\n<p>Spyware&#8217;s pervasive threat extends beyond computers and laptops; it can also manifest as mobile spyware. Mobile spyware operates similarly to its desktop counterparts but is tailored to exploit the unique characteristics of mobile platforms. Cybercriminals often employ various tactics to deliver mobile spyware&ndash;through application stores like Google Play and App Store, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-phishing/\">phishing</a> attacks, or physical access.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/mobile-spyware/\">Mobile Spyware: How Hackers Can Turn Your Phone Into a Stalking Machine</a></p>\n<p>The adaptability and constantly evolving nature of spyware make it a persistent menace in the digital landscape. Its ability to take on various forms and exploit vulnerabilities underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures.</p>\n<h2>Impact of Spyware on Identity Theft</h2>\n<p>The impact of spyware on identity theft cannot be understated. By stealthily recording sensitive personal and financial information, like usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers, it presents a significant risk to a user&#8217;s identity.</p>\n<p>Stolen data can be used for various malicious activities, including unauthorized purchases, opening credit accounts, and even creating a complete identity theft. The consequences of these activities can be financially devastating and may take a significant amount of time and effort to recover from.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>Identity theft remains a significant problem in the United States, and there is no sign of it diminishing soon.

Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources, especially torrents and software cracks notorious for being riddled with spyware. Also, be wary of pop-ups. Never click &ldquo;Agree,&rdquo; &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in a pop-up, as these actions can trigger an automatic spyware download. Instead, close the pop-up by hitting the red X or shutting down your browser altogether.</p>\n<p>Regularly updating your operating system&rsquo;s security patches is another good practice. These patches often contain fixes to known vulnerabilities that spyware and other malicious programs exploit. Also, ensure to download and use your web browser&#8217;s latest, most secure version. Running reputable anti-malware programs, like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\">McAfee Total Protection</a>, which includes spyware removal, can help to detect and remove spyware from your system.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-live-a-digital-life-free-of-spyware/\">How to Live a Digital Life Free of Spyware</a></p>\n<h2>Dealing with Spyware Infections</h2>\n<p>If you suspect your system is infected with spyware, you must act swiftly. Use a trusted antivirus program to run a system scan. If spyware is detected, the program should be able to quarantine and remove it. However, some forms of spyware are advanced and may be able to avoid detection. In such instances, it may be necessary to engage a professional to clean your system.</p>\n<p>Part of dealing with a spyware infection is mitigating its potential effects.

It stealthily operates in the background, recording and transmitting your activities and personal information. While it can be a valuable tool for legal monitoring, its misuse by cybercriminals cannot be underestimated. Preventing and dealing with spyware requires vigilance, good online habits, and the use of trusted antivirus programs like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">McAfee Antivirus</a>.

The web is a lively center filled with various activities such as news, videos, education, blogs, gaming, activism, and entertainment. Notably, social media apps have morphed into the digital meeting points for netizens. Our society is undeniably superbly interconnected, and our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/digital-footprints-privacy-concerns/\">digital persona</a> is greatly treasured.</p>\n<p>However, this isn&#8217;t always beneficial, especially for teenagers who may be overwhelmed by the deluge of information, leading to stress. Stress is a common part of our daily lives, emerging from our education, employment, relationships, and surroundings. A similar situation transpires online. In fact, we tend to cope with stress by expressing our frustrations, confronting problems directly, or evading the issue altogether. Yet, the ways to cope with stress in the virtual world differ. Online stress can arise from unique triggers, and its repercussions can rapidly escalate and proliferate at an alarming rate.</p>\n<h2>Causes of Social Media Stress in Children</h2>\n<p>The rise of social media has brought a concerning phenomenon &ndash; social media stress in children. As these young individuals navigate the complex virtual world, they often encounter a range of stressors that can significantly impact their emotional and psychological well-being. Understanding these underlying causes is a crucial step in addressing and mitigating the adverse effects of social media on our younger generations. Let&rsquo;s delve into the causes of social media stress in children and shed light on the various factors that contribute to this growing issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Peer pressure:</b> The most important reason children are online is to connect with friends. To keep this friendship alive and kicking, they often blindly copy the group leaders, even if they are uncomfortable with their actions.</li>\n<li><b>FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</b> Teens, especially girls, have a competitive spirit when it comes to online presence and don&rsquo;t want to be &lsquo;the last to know&rsquo; so, they end up spending a lot of time online.</li>\n<li><b>Keeping up with the Jones&rsquo;:</b> The same competitive spirit leads kids to spend hours posing and selecting the perfect pics to share online or seek approval from strangers. This is risky, as negative comments online can harm self-confidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Triggers of Social Media Stress</h3>\n<p>Besides the more obvious and well-documented sources of social media stress in children, there exist several other significant triggers that contribute to the overall stress levels experienced by young individuals in the digital age, and these may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Excessive sharing:</b> When kids share a lot of their private information on social media, they leave themselves vulnerable to hacking and open themselves up to contact from inappropriate individuals online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-sharing-online/\">The Ultimate Guide to Safe Sharing Online</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Cyberbullying:</b> Most kids have witnessed or experienced some form of cyberbullying and often end up as either perpetrators or victims, or mute spectators. In all cases, this is a disturbing occurrence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/more-dangers-of-cyberbullying-emerge-our-latest-connected-family-report/\">More Dangers of Cyberbullying Emerge&mdash;Our Latest Connected Family Report</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Lack of screen time limits and lack of empathy:</b> Lack of digital balance can have psychological effects, so digital usage rules are necessary. Similarly, when children are not taught to respect others and their traditions, they do not develop empathy and may bully those with differing views and lifestyles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/raising-digital-kids-5-timeless-tech-principles-to-establish-when-your-kids-are-young/\">5 Screen Time Principles to Establish When Your Kids are Still Babies</a></p>\n<h3>The Role of Parenting</h3>\n<p>Parenting plays a major role in helping children learn how to tackle social media stress. As parents, you know your children the best. Yes, even teens. Observe them, and if you note any change in their social media habits or general behavior, talk to them. The earlier you start having frank one-to-one conversations, the easier it will be for you later. But before that, you may need to modify your response to stress and learn to control your reactions. That way, you will teach them a very important lesson without using a single word.</p>\n<h3>Helping Kids Fight Social Media Stress</h3>\n<p>Children can learn to manage social media stress by developing a healthy online etiquette and creating boundaries for their online activities. Encourage them to accept differences and realize that people have varied opinions. Remind them not to make judgments based on someone&rsquo;s online bio and pictures and to understand that life isn&rsquo;t a bed of roses for anyone. Another important step is to help them understand how important it is to respond tactfully when things get heated online. It&rsquo;s essential that they understand the power of choosing not to engage in online altercations. Being silent doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re weak but smart enough not to get provoked. If any online situation becomes too intense, they should be encouraged to report and block the perpetrator immediately.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>Since each child&#8217;s level of maturity and cognitive capacity to manage online challenges varies, a one-site-fits-all approach to balancing social media and mental health won&rsquo;t work for everyone. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/back-to-school-balancing-social-media-mental-health/\">Find tips on how to find the best method for your child.</a></i></p>\n<h3>Practicing Digital Balance and Awareness</h3>\n<p>One of the keys to managing stress caused by social media is ensuring that kids practice digital balance. Set screen time limits and encourage them to make and maintain friendships in the real world. In-person interactions promote emotional growth and provide a well-rounded social experience. Moreover, it&rsquo;s crucial to instill the idea that maturity is about staying true to their values and wisdom lies in identifying the negatives and avoiding them. Just as they would in the physical world, they should be aware that the digital world comprises both good and bad elements. This awareness can help them navigate online spaces safely. Let them know the importance of applying their real-life values in the digital world and the mantra of STOP, THINK, CONNECT, should always be in their mind before posting anything online.</p>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/6-steps-to-help-your-family-restore-digital-balance-in-stressful-times/\">6 Steps to Help Your Family Restore Digital Balance in Stressful Times</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, parents play a crucial role in helping their children tackle social media stress. By observing their kids&#8217; behavioral changes, having open conversations, and setting appropriate boundaries for their online activities, parents can help their kids navigate the digital world safely. Encouraging children to accept differences, practice tact, maintain digital balance, and be aware of the good and bad online can help alleviate the stress caused by social media.

In our increasingly digital age, cyberbullying has become a pervasive issue that can affect kids even during their summer break. This guide will help parents understand the issue, recognize the signs, and provide practical strategies to protect their kids from cyberbullies.</p>\n<h2><b>The Reality of Summer Cyberbullying</b></h2>\n<p>Summer break should be a time of fun-filled days, exploration, relaxation, and a break from the rigors of the school year. However, with the increase in leisure time comes a corresponding increase in screen time, and, unfortunately, this often results in an uptick in instances of cyberbullying. As the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/cyberbullying-and-teens/\">McAfee survey</a> in 2014 revealed, 87% of teenagers reported witnessing cyberbullying, a significant increase from the previous year. The reasons for being targeted varied, with appearance, race, religion, and sexual orientation all cited as factors. Given this reality, parents must remain vigilant during the summer months. Keeping an eye on your child&#8217;s online activities, encouraging open communication, and intervening when necessary can make the difference between a summer of fun and one of fear and isolation. &rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/more-dangers-of-cyberbullying-emerge-our-latest-connected-family-report/\">More Dangers of Cyberbullying Emerge&mdash;Our Latest Connected Family Report</a></p>\n<h2>Things Not to Do</h2>\n<p>When confronted with bullying, our instinctive reactions aren&#8217;t always the best. Here are three things you should avoid doing when addressing cyberbullying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Telling your child to ignore the bullying. The nature of social media can amplify the impact of bullying, making it impossible to overlook simply.</li>\n<li>Blaming the child for being bullied. Even if your child made poor decisions or inadvertently instigated the situation, nobody deserves to be bullied.</li>\n<li>Encouraging physical retaliation. Fighting back can escalate the situation and put your child in physical or legal danger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3 Ways to Avoid Bullying Online</h2>\n<p>Prevention is the best cure, and there are several proactive steps you can take to minimize the risk of your child being cyberbullied:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make profiles and photos private. Insist on privacy settings for all social profiles. This confines your child&rsquo;s online circles to known friends, reducing the likelihood of cyberbullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/protecting-privacy-social-media/\">Protecting Your Privacy on Social Media</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid risky apps. Certain apps, like ask.fm, Kik Messenger, and Yik Yak, are associated with higher rates of cyberbullying due to their allowance of anonymous interaction. Ensure these are off-limits for your child.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/beware-of-malicious-mobile-apps/\">Beware of Malicious Mobile Apps</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t invite criticism. The online culture often encourages kids to seek approval through &ldquo;likes&rdquo; or &ldquo;ranks&rdquo; of their photos. Discuss the risks involved in this behavior and remind your child of their worth outside these superficial metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3 Things to Do if Bullied Online</h2>\n<p>Despite taking precautions, there may be instances where cyberbullying can&#8217;t be immediately prevented. In such situations, it is crucial to know what steps to take to mitigate the impact and bring the bullying to an end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Tell someone.</b> It&#8217;s important for the child to confide in a trusted adult, somebody who can help manage the situation appropriately. Encourage open communication from the start. Many times, kids withhold information about bullying, allowing it to escalate unchecked. Monitor your child&rsquo;s online behavior discreetly, paying attention to the tone and content of their interactions. It&#8217;s also crucial to provide emotional support and reassurance to children who are being targeted, as they may be suffering from fear, embarrassment, or feelings of isolation.</li>\n<li><b>Save the evidence.</b> Make sure to keep a record of bullying incidents &#8211; texts, emails, social media posts, or screenshot conversations. These might provide valuable information to address the situation and serve as evidence if the need to report to authorities arises.</li>\n<li><b>Report serious incidents to the police.</b> If cyberbullying escalates to the point where it includes threats, intimidation, or any form of sexual exploitation, it&#8217;s time to involve the authorities. Report the situation to the police and specific social networks where bullying occurs. Websites such as <a href=\"https://www.stopbullying.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StopBullying.gov</a> provide comprehensive resources to understand your rights better and get the help you need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Supporting Your Child</h2>\n<p>Addressing the issue of cyberbullying can be a complex task. The emotional wounds inflicted by this abuse can be deep and long-lasting. Therefore, it&#8217;s indispensable that your child feels supported and understood. Maintain an open line of communication with your child, creating a secure and trusting environment where they can comfortably express their feelings and fears. It might also be beneficial to seek professional help when dealing with cases of severe bullying. Therapy or counseling can provide your child with effective coping strategies, helping them regain their confidence and self-esteem. <b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> While numerous aspects of the digital world remain beyond our control, one aspect where we wield significant influence is our commitment to protecting the well-being of our family members in both the digital and mental realms.

By teaching our children the values of empathy and respect, we can contribute to a more positive online culture. Incorporate digital citizenship lessons into your everyday conversations, emphasizing the importance of treating others kindly offline and online. Teach your children to think before they post and remind them that behind every screen, there&#8217;s a real person who can be hurt by their words. Building respect and empathy can discourage cyberbullying and inspire children to stand against it. &rarr; <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/cyberbullyings-impact-society-and-security/\">Cyberbullying&rsquo;s Impact on Both Society and Security</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Parenting in the digital age brings with it new challenges and responsibilities.

But like any new toy, if you don’t use it correctly then there could be issues – which may include your privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT – A Quick Recap</strong></p>\n<p>ChatGPT is an online software program developed by OpenAI that uses a new form of artificial intelligence – <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI</a> – to provide conversational, human-style responses to a broad array of requests. Think of it as Google on steroids. It can solve maths questions, translate copy, write jokes, develop a resume, write code, or even help you prepare for a job interview. If you want to know more, check out my <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/a-parents-guide-to-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parent’s Guide to ChatGPT</a>.</p>\n<p>But for ChatGPT to answer tricky questions and be so impressive, it needs a source for its ‘high IQ’. So, it relies on knowledge databases, open data sources and feedback from users. It also uses social media to gather information and a practice known as ‘web scraping’ to gather data from a multitude of sources online. And it is this super powerful combination that allows ChatGPT to ‘almost always’ deliver on tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Does Generative AI Pose A Threat To My Privacy?</strong></p>\n<p>Your privacy can be affected in several ways. While I discuss some specifics on ChatGPT, similar concerns apply to other generative AI programs. Some of these ways may not concern you, but I’m quite sure some will. Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<p><strong>1. ChatGPT May be Using Your Data Without Your Express Permission</strong></p>\n<p>When ChatGPT (along with many similar tools) absorbed the enormous amount of data it needed to function from sources like books, articles, and web pages, they did so without seeking case-by-case permission. As certain data can be used to identify us, our friends and family or even our location, this can present privacy concerns. Some authors have already filed complaints for usage of their content without compensation, despite ChatGPT offering users a premium package for US$20/month. Recently, many online news outlets have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>blocked </u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>OpenA</u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>I</u></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/25/new-york-times-cnn-and-abc-block-openais-gptbot-web-crawler-from-scraping-content\"><u>’s crawler </u></a>which will limit ChatGPT’s  ability to access their news content.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Whatever You Share With ChatGPT Goes Into Its Data Bank</strong></p>\n<p>Every time you share a piece of information with ChatGPT, you are adding to its data bank, risking that the information ends up somewhere in the public domain. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) recently issued a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-28/ama-calls-for-national-regulations-for-ai-in-health/102381314\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mandate for Western Australian doctors</a> not to use ChatGPT after doctors at a Perth hospital used it to write patient notes. These confidential patient notes could be used to not only further train ChatGPT but could theoretically also be included in responses to other users.</p>\n<p><strong>3. ChatGPT Collects A Lot Of Information About Its Users</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to collecting the information users share, it also collects detailed information about its users. In the <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">company’s privacy policy</a>, it outlines that it collects users’ IP addresses and browser types. It also collects information on the behaviour of its users e.g. the type of content that users engage with as well as the features they use. It also says that it may share users’ <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal information</a> with unspecified parties, without informing them, to meet their business operation needs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Risk of a Data Breach</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks to using ChatGPT and similar generative AI is the risk that your details will be leaked in a data breach. Between 100,000 ChatGPT accounts credentials were compromised and sold on the Dark Web in a large data beach which happened between June 2022 to May 2023, <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/massive-leak-of-chatgpt-credentials-over-100000-accounts-affected/489801/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Search Engine Journal</a>.</p>\n<p>But here’s another potential problem – as ChatGPT users can store conversations, if a hacker gains access to an account, it may mean they also gain access into propriety information, sensitive business information or even confidential personal information.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s ChatGPT Doing To Protect Privacy?</strong></p>\n<p>Now please don’t misunderstand me, ChatGPT is taking action to protect users but it may not be enough to truly protect your privacy.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT does make it very clear that all conversations between a user and ChatGPT are protected by end-to-end encryption. It also outlines that strict access controls are in place so only authorised personnel can access sensitive user data. It also runs a <a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bug Bounty program</a> which rewards ethical hackers for finding security vulnerabilities. However, in order to remain protected while using the app, I believe the onus is on the user to take additional steps to protect their own privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>So, What Can I Do To Protect My Privacy?</strong></p>\n<p>As we all know, nothing is guaranteed in life however there are steps you can take to minimise the risk of your privacy being compromised. Here are my top tips:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Be Careful What You Share With ChatGPT and Other Platforms</strong></p>\n<p>Never share personal or sensitive information in any of your prompts. By doing so, you increase the risk of sharing confidential data with cybercriminals. If you need a sensitive piece of writing edited, ask a friend!!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Consider Deleting Your Chat History</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most useful ways of safeguarding your privacy is to avoid saving your chat history. By default, ChatGPT stores all conversations between users and the chatbot with the aim of training OpenAI’s systems. If you do choose not to save your chat history, OpenAI will store your conversations for 30 days. Despite this, it is still one of the best steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Stay Anonymous</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, ChatGPT can collect and process highly sensitive data and associate it with your email address and phone number. So, why not set up a dedicated email just for ChatGPT? And keep your shared personal details to a minimum. That way, the questions you ask or content you share can’t be associated with your identity. And always use a pseudonym to mask your true identity.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Commit To Staying Up To Date </strong></p>\n<p>Whether it’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard, it’s imperative that you stay up to date with the company’s privacy and data retention policies, so you understand how your data is managed. Find out how long your conversations will be stored for before they are anonymised or deleted and who your details could potentially be shared with.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re looking for a recipe for dinner, ideas for an upcoming birthday party or help with a love letter, by all means get ChatGPT working for you. However, use a dedicated email address, don’t store your conversations and NEVER share sensitive information in the chat box. But if you need help with a confidential or sensitive issue, then maybe find another alternative. Why not phone a friend – on an encrypted app, of course!!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpts-impact-on-privacy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/\">ChatGPT&#8217;s Impact on Privacy and How to Protect Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Future of Work: How Technology & the WFH Landscape Are Making an Impact","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-future-of-work-technology-and-the-wfh-landscape/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 14:00:51 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"network security"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersafety"},{"#cdata-section":"internet security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"IoT"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=101826"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>As of the writing of this article, the height of the pandemic seems like a distant but still vivid dream....</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-future-of-work-technology-and-the-wfh-landscape/\">The Future of Work: How Technology &#038; the WFH Landscape Are Making an Impact</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300x200_Blog_090623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>As of the writing of this article, the height of the pandemic seems like a distant but still vivid dream. Sanitizing packages, sparse grocery shelves, and video conferencing happy hours are things of the past for the majority of the population. Thank goodness.</p>\n<p>A “new normal” society is adapting to today’s working culture. The work landscape changed significantly since 2020, and it might never return to what it once was. In 2022, workers spent an average 3.5 days in the office per week, which is 30% below the prepandemic in-office average.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The work-from-home movement is likely here to stay, to the joy of employees seeking a better work-life balance and flexibility; however, some responsibility does fall upon people like you to secure home offices to protect sensitive company information.</p>\n<p>To make sure you’re not the weak cyber link in your company’s security, make sure to follow these three tips for a secure home office.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Lock Your Screen, Stow Your Device</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re not physically in front of your work computer, best practices dictate that you lock the screen or put your device to sleep. No matter how much you trust your family, roommates, or the trustworthy-looking person seated next to you at a café, your company device houses all kinds of corporate secrets. A stray glance from the wrong person could put that information’s secrecy in jeopardy. Plus, imagine your cat walking across your keyboard or a toddler mashing your mouse, deleting hours’ worth of work. Disastrous.</p>\n<p>Then, when you’re done with work for the day, stow your device in a secure location, preferably a drawer with a lock. Even if your work computer is 10 times faster and sleeker than your personal laptop, keep each device in its designated sphere in your life: work devices only for work, personal devices only for personal activities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Secure Your Home Wi-Fi</strong></p>\n<p>Wi-Fi networks that are not password protected invite anyone off the street to surf on your network and eavesdrop on your online activities. A stranger sneaking on to your home Wi-Fi could be dangerous to your workplace. There would be very little stopping a stranger from spying on your connected work devices and spreading confidential information onto the dark web or leaking company secrets to the media.</p>\n<p>There are a few steps you can take to secure your home office’s internet connection. First, make sure to change the default name and password of your router. Follow <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password best practices</a> to create a strong first defense. For your router name, choose an obscure inside joke or a random pairing of nouns and adjectives. It’s best to omit your address and your real name as the name of your router, because that could alert a cybercriminal that that network belongs to you. Better yet, you can hide your router completely from strangers and only make it searchable to people who know the exact name of your network.</p>\n<p>For an additional layer of protection, connect to a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/what-is-a-vpn-how-it-can-make-your-time-online-more-private-and-secure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual private network</a> (VPN). Your company may offer a corporate VPN. If not, signing up for your own VPN is easy. A VPN encrypts the traffic coming in and going out of your devices making it nearly impossible for a cybercriminal to burst into your online session and see what’s on your screen.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Take Your Security Training Seriously</strong></p>\n<p>The scenarios outlined in your company’s security training may seem far-fetched, but the concepts of those boring corporate videos actually happen! For example, the huge Colonial Pipeline breach in 2021 originated from one employee who didn’t secure the company’s VPN with multifactor authentication (MFA).<sup>2 </sup>Cutting small corners like disabling MFA – which is such a basic and easy-to-use security measure – can have dire consequences.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to your security training and make sure to follow all company cybersecurity rules and use security tools as your IT team intends. For example, if your company requires that everyone use a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-password-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a>, a corporate VPN, and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/protect-your-social-media-passwords-from-hacks-and-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-factor authentication</a>, do so! And use them correctly every workday!</p>\n<p><strong>Secure Home Office, Secure Home</strong></p>\n<p>These tips are essential to a secure home office, but they’re also applicable to when you’re off the clock. Password- or passcode-protecting your personal laptop, smartphone, and tablet keeps prying eyes out of your devices, which actually hold more <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personally identifiable information</a> (PII) than you may think. Password managers, a secure router, VPNs, and safe browsing habits will go a long way toward maintaining your online privacy.</p>\n<p>To fill in the cracks to better protect your home devices and your PII, partner with <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McAfee+</a>. McAfee+ includes a VPN, safe browsing tool, identity monitoring and remediation services, a password manager, and more for a more secure digital life.</p>\n<p>In one global survey, 68% of people prefer hybrid work models, and nearly three-quarters of companies allow employees to work from home some of the time.<sup>3,4 </sup>The flexibility afforded by hybrid work and 100% work-from-home policies is amazing. Cutting out the time and cost of commuting five days a week is another bonus.

Still, deep down, you fear your sloppy digital habits will eventually catch up with you. So, instead of dread and denial, how about a little peace of mind? The perfect time to take a few easy steps and make your digital life your most unhackable is now. Here are seven easy ways to tighten up your digital habits:</p>\n<h2>1. Two-factor authentication</h2>\n<p>This small action sounds like a big deal, but it’s easy and important. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">Two-factor authentication</a> simply puts two layers of security on any personal information channels you frequent. Be it your phone, Facebook, email, or bank account, taking the extra time to implement a two-step password entry, will mean potential crooks will get frustrated and move on to someone else’s information.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Go into the account settings of any important account and manually opt for a two-factor authentication account entry. Once set up, the next time you log in to your account, you&#8217;ll be prompted to provide the secondary authentication, such as entering a code from your authentication app or confirming a text message code</i></p>\n<h2>2. Steer clear of public wifi</h2>\n<p>It’s convenient and fun to work from the local coffee shop. However, it only takes one nosey, unethical person at that location to access your computer through that shared public network. Snoopers can easily access your passwords, emails, and anything else on your computer. Do your sensitive work at home or in the office on a secure, password-protected network and save your non-wifi workload, such as report reading or writing (sans wifi) for the coffee shop. Avoid doing any banking or private work on public wifi, especially.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip: </i></b><i>Check the URL in your browser&#8217;s address bar. If it starts with &#8220;https&#8221; (rather than just &#8220;http&#8221;), it&#8217;s secure and encrypted, ensuring your data is protected during transmission. If it&#8217;s only &#8220;http,&#8221; the site isn&#8217;t secure, so avoid proceeding. If using public Wi-Fi, activate your firewall in your security settings to block incoming traffic and enhance protection against potential threats.</i></p>\n<h2>3. Don’t be lazy with passwords</h2>\n<p>According to McAfee’s Digital Asset Study, the most common mistake consumers make is using the same password for all or most online accounts. If this is you, break this poor habit once and for all.</p>\n<p>Take this step: Take an hour of your day and change and document your passwords. Once you’ve beefed up your passwords, you can simplify the password process by using <a href=\"https://www.truekey.com/\">True Key</a> multi-factor authentication service for free. A strong password has all of the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is at least ten characters in length</li>\n<li>Doesn’t contain any word or words found in the dictionary</li>\n<li>Mixes capital and lower-case letters</li>\n<li>It Contains special characters like numbers, punctuation marks, or symbols.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/tips-for-creating-passwords/\">5 Tips For Creating Bulletproof Passwords</a></p>\n<h2>4. Declutter your devices</h2>\n<p>Simplify, simplify, simplify your gadget use, and your safety will improve immediately. With so many digital assets flying at us daily — email, images, files, documents, attachments — it’s easy to get overwhelmed. And, when we are overwhelmed, it’s easy to get sloppy in the places that matter most — like privacy. Focus on your safety and declutter your devices when needed.</p>\n<p>To organize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phone: Purge unused apps on your phone and desktop</li>\n<li>Phone: Organize your apps into folders on your home screen. Here’s how to do it on your Android or iPhone.</li>\n<li>Laptop, iPad, tablet: Organize your desktop files into folders and organize your folders by years, i.e., 2014, 2015, 2016. If you have old files, either purge them or archive them in a folder or hard drive that doesn’t visually clutter your desktop.</li>\n<li>Laptop: Clean up your email. This is a very good time to purge old emails, build folders, review and file flagged files, and delete old emails with big attachments that may be using memory on your computer. Need to purge all the spam in your inbox? <a href=\"https://unroll.me/\">Unroll.me</a> is a free, fast, easy way to do just that.</li>\n<li>Laptop: Delete unused email accounts, paid subscriptions, and files you no longer use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Target your software</h2>\n<p>While you sleep, work, or play, hackers tirelessly attempt to infiltrate your computer with malicious software, spyware, and viruses. The lack of anti-virus software on your device is an open invitation to these cyber criminals. Therefore, consider investing in robust <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">antivirus software</a> this year. In addition to this, consider installing filtering software to enhance your social media safety, making it a safer platform for your entire family.</p>\n<h2>6. Reconsider your sharing habits</h2>\n<p>Want to take your privacy a notch higher? Consider cutting back on your social sharing. Hackers often create fake social media accounts and use them to monitor your personal data. A determined identity thief on Facebook can gather enough information about you to bypass the security questions on your accounts, potentially gaining access to your financial data. It’s time to rethink your approach to social media. Consider pruning your social circle on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat to include only those you know and trust. The lure of high follower numbers is not worth the risk of a potential security breach. Remind your family never to post personal details like your full name, Social Security number, address, phone number, and account numbers on public websites.</p>\n<p>To minimize potential damage from oversharing, exercise caution when accepting friend requests or follows from people you don&#8217;t know. Also, remember to check your privacy settings. Many platforms allow you to control who sees your posts, profile information, and tagged photos. These features will give you greater control over your online presence.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/protecting-privacy-social-media/\">Protecting Your Privacy on Social Media</a></p>\n<h2>7. Stay updated</h2>\n<p>Updating software can seem like a chore, especially during a busy workday. However, it’s vital to ensure your digital life remains secure. Cybercriminals always look for outdated software and browsers, preying on the security gaps they exploit. If you frequently use software such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Shockwave, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Java, or browsers like Chrome and Internet Explorer, ensure you&#8217;re always running the latest version. By consciously keeping your software updated, you’re erecting yet another line of defense against potential cyber threats.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, remember to back up your files regularly. In case of a cyber-attack, a recent backup can save you a lot of trouble and ensure you don&#8217;t lose any crucial data.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/software-updates-important/\">Why Software Updates Are So Important</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As cybercrimes become increasingly rampant, consider it an ideal opportunity to tighten your digital habits. Investing a little time and effort into securing your digital life can ensure a safer, more protected online experience. Following these simple steps; implementing two-factor authentication, avoiding public wifi, strengthening passwords, decluttering devices, targeting software, reconsidering sharing habits, and staying updated can profoundly impact your digital security.

For many of us, visiting our healthcare provider involves filling out forms that are then transferred into an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. We put our trust in these healthcare institutions, expecting them to take the necessary steps to store our sensitive data securely. However, with a significant rise in medical <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-a-data-breach-and-how-do-you-avoid-it/\">data breaches</a>, a whopping <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2018/09/25/government-data-says-millions-of-health-records-are-breached-every-year/?sh=bb965a716e66\">70% increase</a> over the past seven years, it has become more important to understand how these breaches occur and how we can protect ourselves.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/04/labcorp-data-breach-7-7-million-consumers-affected/1346264001/\">LabCorp</a>, a medical testing company, announced a breach affecting approximately 7.7 million customers, exposing their names, addresses, birth dates, balance, and credit card or bank account information. This breach occurred due to an issue with a third-party billing collections vendor, the American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA). Not long before this, Quest Diagnostics, another company collaborating with AMCA, experienced a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/quest-diagnostics-says-nearly-12-million-patients-may-have-had-data-breached.html\">similar breach</a>, affecting 11.9 million users.</p>\n<h2>What makes Medical Data a Target for Cybercriminals?</h2>\n<p>Medical data is, by nature, nonperishable, making it a highly valuable asset for cybercriminals. This means that while a credit card number or bank account detail can be changed if compromised, medical information remains constant, maintaining its value over time. This also suggests that once procured, this information can be used for various malicious activities, from identity theft to extortion.</p>\n<p>Realizing that the healthcare industry is riddled with various security vulnerabilities is crucial. Unencrypted traffic between servers, the ability to create admin accounts remotely, and the disclosure of private information are all shortcomings that these cybercriminals can exploit. With such access, they can permanently alter medical images, use medical research data for extortion, and much more. According to the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/mcafee-labs.html\">McAfee Labs Threats </a>Report, the healthcare sector witnessed a 210% increase in publicly disclosed security incidents from 2016 to 2017, resulting from failure to comply with security best practices or address vulnerabilities in medical software.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/steps-to-safeguard-your-family-against-a-medical-data-breach/\">How to Safeguard Your Family Against A Medical Data Breach</a></p>\n<h2>What can Users do to Protect their Information?</h2>\n<p>While the onus lies on healthcare institutions to ensure the security of patients&#8217; data, there are several steps that individuals can take on their own to safeguard their privacy. These steps become particularly pivotal if you think your personal or financial information might have been compromised due to recent breaches. In such instances, following certain best practices can significantly enhance your personal data security.</p>\n<h3>1. Placing a Fraud Alert</h3>\n<p>One such measure is placing a fraud alert on your credit. This effectively means that any new or recent requests will be scrutinized, making it challenging for fraudulent activities to occur. Additionally, the fraud alert enables you to access extra copies of your credit report, which you can peruse for any suspicious activities.</p>\n<h3>2. Freezing your Credit and Vigilance</h3>\n<p>Another effective step you can consider is <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/security-freeze/\">freezing your credit</a>. Doing so makes it impossible for criminals to take out loans or open new accounts in your name. However, to execute this effectively, remember that credit needs to be frozen at each of the three major credit-reporting agencies &#8211; Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.</p>\n<p>Moreover, vigilance plays a critical role in protecting your personal data. Regularly checking your bank account and credit activity can help you spot any anomalies swiftly, allowing you to take immediate action.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> To lock or to freeze? That is the question. Credit lock only offers limitations in accessing an account. A credit freeze generally has more security features and financial protections guaranteed by law and the three major credit bureaus, so you’ll have more rights and protection if identity theft, fraud, scams, and other cybercrimes occur with a credit freeze compared to a credit lock. Learn more about the difference between credit freeze and credit lock </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/credit-lock-and-credit-freeze-which-service-is-best-for-you-both/\"><i>here</i></a><i>. </i></p>\n<h3>3. Consider Using Identity Theft Protection Services</h3>\n<p>Identity theft protection services offer an additional layer of security to protect your personal as well as financial information. They actively monitor your accounts, provide prompt alerts for any suspicious activities, and help you recover losses if things go awry. An identity theft protection service like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html\">McAfee Identity Theft Protection</a> can be beneficial. Remember, however, that even with such a service, you should continue practicing other security measures, as they form part of a comprehensive approach to data security.</p>\n<p>These services work in the background to ensure constant protection. However, choosing a reputable and reliable identity theft protection service is essential. Do thorough research before committing and compare features such as monitoring services, recovery assistance, and insurance offerings. This step can help protect you not only during medical data breaches but also on other digital platforms where your personal information is stored.</p>\n<h3>4. Be Vigilant About Checking Your Accounts</h3>\n<p>If you suspect your personal data has been compromised, you should check your bank account and credit activity frequently. Regular monitoring of your accounts empowers you to stop fraudulent activity. Many banks and credit card companies provide free alerts—through an email or text message—whenever a new purchase is made, an unusual charge is noticed, or your account balance drops to a particular level.</p>\n<p>Besides, you should also consider utilizing apps or online services provided by banks and credit companies to keep an eye on your accounts. Such tools can help you track your financial activity conveniently and take instant action if any suspicious activity is spotted. Regularly updating your contact information with banks and credit companies is also important, as it ensures you receive all alerts and updates on time.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper</b>: <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/online-banking-simple-steps-to-protect-yourself-from-bank-fraud/\">Online Banking—Simple Steps to Protect Yourself from Bank Fraud</a></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Increased digitization in the healthcare sector has brought convenience and improved patient services. However, it also presents attractive targets for cybercriminals eager to exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain. Medical data breaches are concerning due to their potential long-term impacts, so it’s critical to protect your personal information proactively.</p>\n<p>While healthcare institutions must shoulder the primary responsibility to safeguard patient information, users are far from helpless.

But rather than a ring, the lyric would be <i>&#8220;If you like it, you better put a PIN on it.</i>&#8221; A PIN, or Personal Identification Number, is your first defense against thieves or hackers who might want to access your private data from your smartphone or tablet.</p>\n<p>As we increasingly depend on our digital devices to store and transfer personal data and use the internet for transactions, we are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to digital attacks on our privacy. Having a PIN on your devices is a simple but effective way to add an extra layer of security. Yet, it is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4716098/fingerprint-analysis-touch-id-sensor-iphone-5s\">reported</a> that half of iPhone users, for instance, don&#8217;t use a lock on their devices. In another study, a <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/smart-phone-thefts-rose-to-3-1-million-last-year/index.htm\">nationwide survey</a> by Consumer Reports in 2014 found that 30% of people don&#8217;t have a PIN or passcode on their smartphones or tablets. This is concerning because by not securing their devices, they are exposing themselves to potential threats of financial fraud, <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\">identity theft</a>, and privacy loss.</p>\n<h2>The Importance of Protecting Your Private Data</h2>\n<p>Your device and its private data are invaluable resources for any potential hacker or data thief. Yet, we often do not protect our smartphones or tablets, the sensitive information they contain, or our wallets or home computers. Every day should be Data Privacy Day, a time to stress the importance of taking privacy seriously and review your privacy settings and practices.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-data-privacy-and-how-can-i-safeguard-it/\">What is Data Privacy and How Can I Safeguard It?</a></p>\n<p>By not protecting your mobile devices, you are potentially opening yourself up to financial fraud, identity theft, and overall invasion of your privacy. The data available on your phone, from personal photos and conversations to banking information and private documents, can be a goldmine for any potential attacker. This is why companies like <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/\">McAfee</a> are announcing new pushes for personal security, such as the &#8220;Crack the Pin&#8221; initiative. This encourages people to take simple steps toward preserving their privacy by locking, tracking, and encrypting their devices.</p>\n<h2>Simple Steps to Protect Your Privacy</h2>\n<p>From fortifying your online accounts with robust passwords to understanding the intricacies of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/what-is-encryption/\">encryption</a>, and from practicing discretion in sharing personal information to recognizing the red flags of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-phishing/#:~:text=One%20way%20these%20scammers%20may,communication%20is%20called%20%E2%80%9Cphishing.%E2%80%9D\">phishing attempts</a>, let’s explore a comprehensive set of strategies and practices to help you navigate the digital world with confidence and protect what matters most—your privacy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Create Strong, Unique Passwords</b> &#8211; It&#8217;s essential to emphasize the importance of unique passwords for each online account you have. Using a password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords securely.</li>\n<li><b>Regularly Change Passwords:</b> Encourage the habit of changing passwords periodically, especially for sensitive accounts like email, online banking, and social media. Consider doing this every three to six months.</li>\n<li><b>Secure Your Email &#8211; </b>Your email account is a gateway to many of your other online accounts. Enable <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> on your email to add an extra layer of security.</li>\n<li><b>Review App Permissions and Privacy Settings: </b>Take the time to go through the privacy settings of your apps and social media accounts. Limit the data you share and the permissions you grant to apps.</li>\n<li><b>Be Cautious with Personal Information Sharing:</b> When asked for personal information online or over the phone, ask why it&#8217;s needed and how it will be used. Only share what&#8217;s necessary and relevant.</li>\n<li><b>Beware of Public Wi-Fi:</b> Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions or logging into important accounts. If necessary, use a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html\">VPN</a> to encrypt your internet connection.</li>\n<li><b>Regular Software Updates:</b> Keep all your devices and software updated with the latest security patches. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><b>Stay Informed:</b> Stay informed about current privacy threats and best practices by following reputable tech news sources and cybersecurity blogs. Knowledge is your best defense.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Securing Your Mobile Devices</h2>\n<p>One way to ensure the privacy of your mobile devices is through the use of mobile security products. McAfee, for example, has products such as <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mobile.html\">McAfee Mobile Security</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-livesafe.html\">McAfee LiveSafe</a> that are designed specifically to protect your devices and the personal data stored on them. These products provide a wide range of security features, from data encryption to anti-theft measures and privacy protection. They can scan apps for potential threats, prevent phishing attacks, and allow you to locate, lock, and wipe your devices in case they get lost or stolen.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/does-my-phone-have-a-virus.html\">Does My Phone Have a Virus?</a></p>\n<p>Beyond using security products, staying educated on the latest data privacy trends and security measures is also important. This includes keeping your operating system and apps updated, as software updates often contain vital security improvements. Regularly backing up your data is also crucial so that your personal data is not completely lost in the event of a device loss or failure.</p>\n<h2>The Role of Encryption</h2>\n<p>Another important aspect of securing your mobile devices is encryption. Encryption is a process that converts your data into an unreadable format that cannot be understood without the correct decryption key. Essentially, even if a hacker or thief manages to access your device, they cannot read your data if it is encrypted. Many smartphones and tablets have encryption options built into the settings, but it&#8217;s up to the user to ensure they turn it on and use it correctly.</p>\n<p>When it comes to encryption, it&#8217;s also crucial to understand the difference between device encryption and app encryption. Device encryption ensures that all data stored on your device is secure, while app encryption secures data within specific apps. While both are important, device encryption is generally considered more comprehensive. However, you should still check the privacy settings in individual apps to ensure your data is protected.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> When engaging in activities like online banking, shopping, or signing up on a website that requests your personal details, be sure to check for a website address that commences with &#8220;https:&#8221; rather than just &#8220;http:&#8221;. This signifies that the site employs encryption for added security. Learn more about </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-encryption/\"><i>encryption</i></a><i> here. </i></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, securing your mobile devices and their precious personal data should be a top priority. The first step is to put a PIN on your devices and ensure it&#8217;s not easily guessable. Other important steps include refraining from sharing your PIN, using security products, staying updated on the latest privacy trends, and employing encryption for comprehensive security. Remember, data privacy is not a one-time event, but a continuous process that requires regular attention and action. So let&#8217;s take a page from Beyonce&#8217;s book and &#8220;put a PIN on it&#8221; to keep our private data safe and secure.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/crack-the-pin/\">Put a PIN on It: Securing Your Mobile Devices</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Medical Care From Home: Telemedicine and Seniors","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/medical-care-fromhome-telemedicine-and-seniors/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Sun, 03 Sep 2023 13:43:11 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"Mobile Security"},{"#cdata-section":"privacy"},{"#cdata-section":"#PrivacyAware"},{"#cdata-section":"telehealth"},{"#cdata-section":"telemedicine"},{"#cdata-section":"seniors"},{"#cdata-section":"medical care from home"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=102142"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/300x200_MFE_Blogs_081421_Blog.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Telemedicine appointment\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/300x200_MFE_Blogs_081421_Blog.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/300x200_MFE_Blogs_081421_Blog-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>For weeks and even months now, millions of us have relied on the internet in ways we haven’t before.

We’ve <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/working-from-home-5-tips-to-stay-secure/\">worked remotely</a> on it, our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/school-from-home-square-one-basics/\">children have schooled from home</a> on it, and we’ve pushed the limits of our household bandwidth as families have streamed, gamed, and conferenced all at the same time. Something else is new—more and more of us have visited our doctors and healthcare professionals online. Needless to say, this is an entirely new experience for many. And with that, I got to thinking about seniors. What’s been their experience with telemedicine? What concerns have they had? And how can we help?</p>\n<p>For starters, an online doctor’s visit is known as <a href=\"https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Telemedicine.aspx\">telemedicine</a>—a way of diagnosing and treating a medical issue remotely. With telemedicine, care comes from your smartphone or computer via a video conference or a healthcare provider’s portal.</p>\n<h2>The Rise of Telemedicine</h2>\n<p>Telemedicine is not new at all. It’s been in use for some time now, such as in rural communities that have little access to local healthcare professionals, in cases of ongoing treatment like heart health monitoring and diabetes care, and in situations where a visit to the doctor’s office simply isn’t practical. What is new is this: telemedicine has made a significant leap in recent months.</p>\n<p>A recent global consumer survey by <a href=\"https://www.dynata.com/healthcare/\">Dynata</a> took a closer look at this trend. The research spanned age groups and nations across North America and Europe, which found that 39% of its respondents consulted a physician or healthcare professional online in the past few months. Of them, two-thirds said they used telemedicine as part of their care. Yet more telling, 84% of those who recently had a telemedicine appointment said this was the first time they used telemedicine.</p>\n<h2>Satisfaction with Telemedicine Among Seniors</h2>\n<p>Dynata’s study also looked at their attitudes and experiences with telemedicine based on age and reported that members of the Baby Boomer generation found the experience satisfactory—just over 55%. Interestingly, this was also quite consistent across other age groups, with all hovering just above or below that same level of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Another study gives us insight into how seniors&#8217; opinions about telemedicine may have changed in the past year. We can contrast the findings above with a <a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/151376/NPHA_Telehealth-Report-FINAL-093019.pdf\">University of Michigan study</a> that polled American adults aged 50 to 80 in the middle of 2019. On the topic of telemedicine, the research found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64% would consider using telemedicine if they had an unexpected illness while traveling</li>\n<li>58% saw it as an option for a return visit or follow-up</li>\n<li>34% would use it to address a new health concern</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Concerns Regarding Telemedicine</h2>\n<p>The University of Michigan study also asked how older Americans felt about telemedicine visits. At that time in 2019, only 14% said that their provider offered telemedicine visits, while 55% didn’t know if they had the option available to them at all. Just a small number, 4%, said they’d had a telemedicine visit within the year. Needless to say, it’ll be interesting to see what 2020’s results would have to say should the university run this poll again.</p>\n<p>In terms of their experience with telemedicine, of those who had at least one telemedicine visit, 58% felt that in-person office visits provided an overall better level of care, and about 55% felt that in-person visits were better for communicating with their healthcare professional and feeling better cared-for overall.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper:</b> <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/6-tips-for-a-safer-and-easier-telemedicine-visit/\">6 Tips for a Safer and Easier Telemedicine Visit</a></p>\n<h2>Benefits of Telemedicine for Seniors</h2>\n<p>While it may seem daunting for seniors to navigate the world of telemedicine, there are several advantages to this healthcare approach. One of the main benefits of telemedicine is the elimination of travel time. This can be particularly beneficial for seniors with mobility issues or living in rural areas lacking transportation. As all consultations are conducted virtually, seniors can access healthcare from the comfort of their homes.</p>\n<p>Another benefit is the ease of monitoring chronic conditions. Telemedicine allows healthcare providers to closely monitor patients&#8217; symptoms and adjust treatment plans without requiring frequent office visits. This not only saves time but can also lead to better health outcomes. With health trackers and mobile applications, healthcare providers can remotely monitor vitals like blood sugar levels or heart rate, enabling immediate intervention if required.</p>\n<p>→ <b>Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-to-make-telehealth-safer-for-a-more-convenient-life-online/\">How to Make Telehealth Safer for a More Convenient Life Online</a></p>\n<h2>Overcoming Technological Barriers</h2>\n<p>The main barrier to telemedicine for seniors is often technology. A lack of familiarity with the required devices and applications can prove daunting for some. However, with a little help and guidance, this can be overcome. Caregivers, family members, or telemedicine providers can teach seniors how to use the necessary technology. Various user-friendly applications are designed with seniors in mind, simplifying the process.</p>\n<p>Providers also often have customer support available to assist with any technological difficulties. It&#8217;s essential to remember that the benefits of telemedicine can considerably outweigh the initial learning curve of navigating these new tools. Practice and patience can go a long way in making telemedicine a comfortable and convenient option for seniors.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> One essential item seniors should have during their visit is a dependable device they are familiar with. This could include a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet. Remember that certain telemedicine solutions used by healthcare providers might have specific requirements, so it&#8217;s important to check those and ensure their devices are compatible.</i></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Telemedicine can benefit seniors, offering more accessible healthcare services and better chronic condition management. While technological may seem challenging, it can be successfully navigated with the right guidance and support. Ultimately, telemedicine is a tool to improve healthcare accessibility and outcomes for seniors, and taking the first steps towards embracing it can lead to better health and comfort.</p>\n<p>Improve your telemedicine use with <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html\">McAfee+</a>, which comes with identity monitoring, unlimited VPN, antivirus, scam protection, data cleanup, and more.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/medical-care-fromhome-telemedicine-and-seniors/\">Medical Care From Home: Telemedicine and Seniors</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"What Makes My Passwords Vulnerable?","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-makes-my-passwords-vulnerable/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Sun, 03 Sep 2023 12:33:16 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Family Safety"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"android"},{"#cdata-section":"cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"malware"},{"#cdata-section":"mobile security"},{"#cdata-section":"network security"},{"#cdata-section":"endpoint protection"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"},{"#cdata-section":"email and web security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"http://blogs.mcafee.com/?p=19415"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Scam-protection-blog-300x200-1.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Scam-protection-blog-300x200-1.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Scam-protection-blog-300x200-1-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Passwords serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to our online accounts, be it email, social media, banking, or other sensitive platforms.

From a practical perspective, we must understand the behind-the-scenes actions that could potentially compromise our passwords and consequently, our digital lives.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most users frequently overlook this crucial part of their digital existence. They remain largely ignorant of numerous common techniques that hackers employ to crack passwords, leading to the potential loss of personal details, financial information, or even identity theft. Therefore, this blog aims to enlighten readers on how they might be unknowingly making their passwords vulnerable.</p>\n<h2>Common Techniques for Cracking Passwords</h2>\n<p>Passwords serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to our online accounts, be it email, social media, banking, or other sensitive platforms. However, the unfortunate reality is that not all passwords are created equal, and many individuals and organizations fall victim to password breaches due to weak or compromised credentials. Let&#8217;s explore the common techniques for cracking passwords, and learn how to stay one step ahead in the ongoing battle for <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-internet-security/\">online security</a>.</p>\n<h3>Dictionary Attacks</h3>\n<p>In the world of cyber-attacks, dictionary attacks are common. This approach relies on using software that plugs common words into the password fields in an attempt to break in. It&#8217;s an unfortunate fact that free online tools exist to make this task almost effortless for cybercriminals. This method spells doom for passwords that are based on dictionary words, common misspellings, slang terms, or even words spelled backward. Likewise, using consecutive keyboard combinations such as <i>qwerty</i> or <i>asdfg</i> is equally risky. An excellent practice to deflect this attack is to use unique character combinations that make dictionary attacks futile.</p>\n<p>Besides text-based passwords, these attacks also target numeric passcodes. When over 32 million passwords were exposed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/dec/15/rockyou-hacked-passwords\">breach</a>, nearly 1% of the victims used &#8216;123456&#8217; as their password. Close on its heels, &#8216;12345&#8217; was the next most popular choice, followed by similar simple combinations. The best prevention against such attacks is avoiding predictable and simple passwords.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/cracking-passwords-is-as-easy-as-123/\">Cracking Passwords is as Easy as “123”</a></p>\n<h3>Cracking Security Questions</h3>\n<p>While security questions help in password recovery, they also present a potential vulnerability. When you forget your password and click on the &#8216;Forgot Password&#8217; link, the website generally poses a series of questions to verify your identity. The issue here is that many people use easily traceable personal information such as names of partners, children, other family members, or pets as their answers, some of which can be found on social media profiles with little effort. To sidestep this vulnerability, it&#8217;s best not to use easily accessible personal information as the answer to security questions.</p>\n<p><b><i>McAfee Pro Tip:</i></b><i> Exercise caution when sharing content on social media platforms. Avoid making all your personal information publicly accessible to thwart hackers from gathering sensitive details about you. Learn more about the dangers of oversharing on social media </i><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/oversharing-are-you-ignoring-your-childs-privacy-when-you-post-online/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n<h2>Password Reuse Across Multiple Platforms</h2>\n<p>A common mistake that many internet users make is reusing the same password for multiple accounts. This practice is dangerous as if one data breach compromises your password, the hackers can potentially gain access to other websites using the same login credentials. According to a <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/-/media/3c627ed089e84bc39ca2bf6bf1d7cdec.pdf\">report</a> published by LastPass in 2022, a recent breach revealed a shocking password reuse rate of 31% among its victims. Hence, using unique passwords for each of your accounts significantly reduces the risk associated with password reuse.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s also advisable to keep changing your passwords regularly. While this might seem like a hassle, it is a small price to pay for ensuring your digital security. Using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/\">password manager</a> can help you remember and manage different passwords for different websites.</p>\n<h2>Social Engineering</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/social-engineering/\">Social Engineering</a> is a non-technical strategy that cybercriminals use, which relies heavily on human interaction and psychological manipulation to trick people into breaking standard security procedures. They lure their unsuspecting victims into revealing confidential data, especially passwords. Therefore, vigilance and skepticism are invaluable weapons to have in your arsenal to ward off such attacks.</p>\n<p>The first step here would be not to divulge your password to anyone, no matter how trustworthy they seem. You should also be wary of unsolicited calls or emails asking for your sensitive information. Remember, legitimate companies will never ask for your password through an email or a phone call.</p>\n<h2>Methods to Enhance Password Security</h2>\n<p>Despite the vulnerabilities attached to passwords, much can be done to enhance their security. For starters, creating a strong password is the first line of defense. To achieve this, you need to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Making the password long, at least 12 to 15 characters, significantly improves its strength. It&#8217;s also advisable to avoid using common phrases or strings of common words as passwords- they can be cracked through advanced versions of dictionary attacks.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating a strong password, adopting multi-factor authentication can greatly enhance your account security. This technology requires more than one form of evidence to verify your identity. It combines something you know (your password), something you have (like a device), and something you are (like your fingerprint). This makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access even if they have your password.</p>\n<p>→<b> Dig Deeper: </b><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/15-tips-to-better-password-security/\">15 Tips To Better Password Security</a></p>\n<h2>Future of Passwords</h2>\n<p>The future of passwords looks promising. Scientists and tech giants are working relentlessly to develop stronger and more efficient access control tools. Biometrics, dynamic-based biometrics, image-based access, and hardware security tokens are some of the emerging technologies promising to future-proof digital security. With biometrics, users will no longer need to remember complex passwords as access will be based on unique personal features such as fingerprints or facial recognition.</p>\n<p>Another promising direction is the use of hardware security tokens, which contain digital certificates to authenticate the user. These tokens can be used in combination with a password to provide <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/authentication-methods-101/\">two-factor authentication</a>. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access as they would need both your token and your password. While these technologies are still developing, they suggest a future where access control is more secure and user-friendly.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, while there&#8217;s no such thing as a perfectly secure password, much can be done to enhance their security. Understanding the common techniques for cracking passwords, such as dictionary attacks and security questions&#8217; exploitation, is the first step towards creating more secure passwords. Using unique complex passwords, combined with multi-factor authentication and software tools like McAfee’s <a href=\"https://www.truekey.com/?path=blogs\">True Key</a>, can greatly improve the security of your accounts.</p>\n<p>The future of passwords looks promising with the development of biometrics and hardware security tokens. Until then, it&#8217;s crucial to adopt the best password practices available to protect your digital life. Remember, your online security is highly dependent on the strength and uniqueness of your passwords, so keep them complex, unique, and secure.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-makes-my-passwords-vulnerable/\">What Makes My Passwords Vulnerable?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"USB Drives – Protecting Your Humble Workhorse from Malware and Loss","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/usb-drives-protecting-your-humble-workhorse-from-malware-and-loss/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 01 Sep 2023 12:00:54 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"malware"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=173118"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_090123.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_090123.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/300x200_Blog_090123-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>The humble USB drive—the workhorse of students, professionals, and everyday computer users.

And that asterisk is known as spyware. Spyware can use your phone for snooping in several ways, including using your camera to take pictures and videos.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What exactly is spyware? It’s any software or app that steals information from a device and passes it to another party without the victim’s knowledge. And here’s the tricky part—you might have installed it yourself, right from an app store. In other words, you can end up with spyware without a hacker installing it on your phone via a malicious download or link.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fortunately, you can avoid spyware rather easily.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How do phones take pictures and videos without your knowledge?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">First off, it helps to know how spyware can take over your phone’s camera.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It comes down to permissions. Apps require permissions to do things like access your contacts, photo library, microphone, and camera. For example, a social media app will ask for permission to access your camera if you want to snap a pic and post it online. A messaging app might ask for access to your camera and microphone to send video and voice messages. Likewise, a navigation or rideshare app will ask for permission to access your phone’s location services. Depending on your specific settings, your app might ask for permissions each time you use it, or you might give an app blanket permissions the first time you use it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Effectively, permissions make apps go. Yet some apps cross the line. They ask for invasive permissions that they absolutely don’t need to function. A classic example is the glut of old flashlight apps that asked for permission to access things like contact lists and cameras. With those permissions, bad actors stole all manner of personal information. In some cases, they used the phone’s camera and microphone to spy on their victims. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That old “flashlight app” ruse continues today.

It starts out like many. Amber wanted a job that allowed remote work, and luckily enough, a recruiter reached out to her through an online recruiting site with an opportunity.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, the recruiter directed Amber to download a messaging app, which the company would use for the interview process. The interview went just fine, Amber got a job offer, and then the company asked Amber for a home address.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Here&#8217;s where the catch comes in. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Amber goes on to say that the company sent her a check by overnight mail, a check she should use to buy equipment. A check for nearly $5,000. For days, the check didn’t post. The company repeatedly asked for update. Had it posted yet? Had it posted yet? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">At this point, Amber said she got suspicious. She contacted her bank. The check had a hold placed on it, and according to Amber, she was charged a fee and her account frozen for days. In speaking with her bank, Amber was told that the check was bad and that she was the victim of a scam. The bank has seen a lot of it lately, said Amber.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet based on what we’ve seen, Amber got lucky.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What do online job scams look like?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Victims and banks sometimes fail to spot the scam as it unfolds. In those cases, the check gets posted and the scammers tell the victim to forward the money to another person who’ll purchase equipment for them. Usually by way of an online payment app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Days later, the check bounces for insufficient funds. Meanwhile, victims get burdened with the fraud reporting process — with their bank and with the payment app they used. Depending on the means and terms of payment, some or all of that money might be gone for good. And as a result, the scammers get a few thousand dollars richer.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you spend some time on social media, you’ll stumble across plenty of videos that tell this exact story in one form or another. And with each story, you’ll find dozens of people sharing that the same thing happened, or almost happened, to them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We’re glad people are taking to TikTok to share their stories, even as sharing those stories can get painful. You can avoid these scams. Part of it involves awareness. They’re still going strong. The next part counts on you and your sharp eye to spot sketchy behavior when you see it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We’ll show you how, and that begins with a look at where these scams take place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online job scams — what’s going on out there?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Employment figures continue to surge. It’s a hot job market out there, and when things get hot, you’ll find scammers looking to turn a buck. It’s much like tax season and gift-giving holidays. Scammers will take advantage of trends and seasonal events where people go online and there’s money involved. Job scams are no different.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Where do these scams crop up?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As we reported earlier this year and as TikTok videos have shared, many appear to originate from trusted online recruiting platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed. Scammers will either set up a bogus company or pose as a representative of a legitimate company. In other cases, job scams take root on social media. Here, scammers play the same game—set up a bogus company or impersonate a legitimate one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">From there, stories like Amber’s unfold.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Without question, recruiting and social media platforms know what’s going on and take steps to quash scam accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://about.linkedin.com/transparency/community-report#fake-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">LinkedIn’s latest community report cited the removal of more than 21 million fake accounts in the first half of 2022</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Stopped at registration – 16.4 million accounts. </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Restricted proactively before members reported – 5.4 million accounts. </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Restricted after members reported – 190 thousand accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, </span><a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook/#content-actioned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Facebook took action on 426 million fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> in Q1 of 2023 alone, with nearly 99% of them acted on before users reported them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In its guidelines for a safe job search, </span><a href=\"https://support.indeed.com/hc/en-us/articles/216354123-Guidelines-for-Safe-Job-Search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Indeed</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> mentions the global teams “dedicated to the safety and authenticity of the jobs posted on our platform.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Still, some scammers make their way through to these platforms and others like them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online job scams — here’s what to look out for:</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our earlier advice on the topic still holds true. You can spot scams several ways, particularly when you know that scammers want your money and personal information as quickly as possible. The moment any so-called job offer asks for any of those, a red flag should immediately go up. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s possibly a scam if: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They ask for your Social Security or tax ID number. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the hands of a scammer, your SSN or tax ID is the key to your identity. With it, they can open up bank cards, lines of credit, apply for insurance benefits, collect benefits and tax returns, or even commit crimes, all in your name. Needless to say, scammers will ask for it, perhaps under the guise of a background check or for payroll purposes. The only time you should provide your SSN or tax ID is when you know that you have accepted a legitimate job with a legitimate company. Only sent it through a secure document signing service, never via email, text, or over the phone. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They want your banking information. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another trick scammers rely on is asking for bank account information so that they can wire a payment to you. As with the SSN above, closely guard this information and treat it in exactly the same way. Don’t give it out unless you have a legitimate job with a legitimate company. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They want you to pay before you get paid. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Some scammers will take a different route. They’ll promise employment, but first you’ll need to pay them for training, onboarding, or equipment before you can start work. Legitimate companies won’t make these kinds of requests. Amber’s check story provides a good example of this.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">They tell you to download a specific messaging app to communicate with them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Victims report that the scammers require a specific app to chat and, sometimes, to conduct the interview itself. Apps like Signal and Wire get mentioned, yet rest assured that these apps themselves are legitimate. The scammers are the problem, not the apps. Consider it a warning sign if someone asks you to largely communicate this way. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Other signs of a job scam — more red flags to look for: </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Aside from the types of information they ask for, the way they ask for your information offers other clues that you might find yourself mixed up in a scam. Look out for the following as well: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) The offer is big on promises but short on details. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">You can sniff out many online scams with the “too good to be true” test. Scammers often make big promises during the holidays with low-priced offers for hard-to-get holiday gifts and then don’t deliver. It’s the same with job scams. The high pay, the low hours, and even the offer of things like a laptop and other perks, these are signs that a job offer might be a scam. Moreover, when pressed for details about this seemingly fantastic job opportunity, scammers might balk. Or they might come back with incomplete or inconsistent replies because the job doesn’t exist at all. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2) They communicate only through email or chat. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Job scammers hide behind their screens. They use the anonymity of the internet to their advantage. Job scammers likewise create phony profiles on networking and social media websites, which means they won’t agree to a video chat or call, which are commonly used in legitimate recruiting today. If your job offer doesn’t involve some sort of face-to-face communication, that indicates it might be a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3) And the communications seem a lit</span></b><strong>tle …off.  </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers now have an additional tool to reel in their victims — AI chatbots like Chat GPT, which can generate email correspondence, chats, LinkedIn profiles, and other content in seconds so they can bilk victims on a huge scale. However, AI has its limits. Right now, it tends to use shorter sentences in a way that seems like it’s spitting out information. There’s little story or substance to the content it creates. That might be a sign of a scam. Likewise, even without AI, you might spot a recruiter using technical or job-related terms in unusual ways, as if they’re unfamiliar with the work they’re hiring for. That’s another potential sign. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">4) Things move too quickly. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers love quick conversion. Yet job seekers today know that interview processes are typically long and involved, often relying on several rounds of interviews and loops. If a job offer comes along without the usual rigor and the recruiter is asking for personal information practically right away, that’s another near-certain sign of a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">5) You get job offers on Facebook or other social media sites not associated with job searches. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This is another red flag. Legitimate businesses stick to platforms associated with networking for business purposes, typically not networking for families, friends, and interests. Why do scammers use sites like Facebook anyway? They’re a gold mine of information. By trolling public profiles, they have access to years of posts and armloads of personal information on thousands of people, which they can use to target their attacks. This is another good reason to set your social media profiles on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and other friend-oriented sites to private so that scammers of all kinds, not just job scammers, can’t use your information against you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Further ways you can protect yourself from job scams. </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As a job hunter you know that getting the right job requires some research.

Your credit card number while you shop. Your password when you bank. That confidential contract you just sent to a </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">client. And</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> your logins for social media too.

Network analyzers, or packet sniffers as many call them, can read the data traffic that travels across a network. And because public Wi-Fi networks are open, so is the data traffic — loaded with your credentials, personal info, and so on. A bad actor can gather up data with a packet sniffer, analyze it, and pluck out the sensitive bits of information that are of value.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is where a VPN comes in.

Even on public Wi-Fi.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Let’s take a look at what a VPN is, how it works, and why it’s your friend on public Wi-Fi.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is a VPN and how does it protect me?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN is an app that you install on your device to help keep your data safe as you browse the internet. When you turn on your VPN app, your device makes a secure connection to a VPN server that routes internet traffic. Securely. This keeps your online activity private on any network, shielding it from prying eyes. Thus, while you’re on a VPN, you can browse and bank with the confidence that your passwords, credentials, and financial information are secure. If any malicious actors attempt to intercept your web traffic, they’ll only see garbled content, thanks to your VPN’s encryption functionality.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN change my IP address?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every internet connection is assigned a unique set of numbers called an IP address, which is tied to information such as geographic location or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). A VPN replaces your actual IP address to make it look like you’ve connected to the internet from the physical location of the VPN server, rather than your real location. This is just one </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">reason</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> so many people use VPNs.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How can I use a VPN to change my IP address? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To change your IP address, you open your VPN app, select the server location you’d like to connect to, and you’re done. You’re now browsing with a new IP address. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When should I use a VPN?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">An ideal case for using a VPN is when you’re using public Wi-Fi at the airport, a café, hotel, or just about any place “free Wi-Fi” is offered. The reason being is that these are open networks, and any somewhat enterprising cybercriminal can tap into these networks and harvest sensitive information as a result. One survey showed that </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/731556/worldwide-public-wifi-safety-awareness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">39% of internet users worldwide understand public Wi-Fi is unsafe</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, yet some users still bank, shop, and do other sensitive things on public Wi-Fi despite the understood risks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, you have your privacy to consider. You can use a VPN to help stop advertisers from tracking you. Searches you perform and websites you visit won’t get traced back to you, which can prevent advertisers from gleaning information about you and your online habits in general. Moreover, some ISPs collect the browsing history of their users and share it with advertisers and other third parties. A VPN can prevent this type of collection as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Can a VPN protect my search history?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN protects your search history through the secure connection you share. When you search for a website, or type a URL into your navigation bar, your device sends something called a DNS request, which translates the website into the IP address of the web server. This is how your browser can find the website and serve its content to you. By encrypting your DNS requests, a VPN can hide your search habits and history from those that might use that info as part of building a profile of you. Others might use this info in a wide variety of ways, from legitimately serving targeted ads to nefarious social engineering.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are VPNs and “Incognito Mode” and “Private Mode” in browsers the same thing? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that a VPN is quite different and far, far more comprehensive than using “Private Mode” or “Incognito Mode” on your browser. Those modes only hide your search history locally on your device—not from others on the internet, like ISPs and advertisers. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN make me anonymous?  </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">No, a VPN </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">can&#8217;t</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> make you anonymous.

Yet there is one important distinction: it only protects your privacy while surfing with the Safari browser. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Per Apple, it works like this: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When Private Relay is enabled, your requests are sent through two separate, secure internet relays. Your IP address is visible to your network provider and to the first relay, which is operated by Apple. Your DNS records are encrypted, so neither party can see the address of the website you’re trying to visit. The second relay, which is operated by a third-party content provider, generates a temporary IP address, decrypts the name of the website you requested, and connects you to the site. All of this is done using the latest internet standards to maintain a high-performance browsing experience while protecting your privacy.</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Check to see if Apple Private Relay is available in your country or region.

To stay in contact with your traveling partners, consider outfitting your party with prepaid phones.

Passwords are your first line of defense. However, one thing that can be a headache is the number of passwords we have to juggle—a number that seems like it’s growing every day. Look around online and you’ll see multiple studies and articles stating that the average person has upwards of 80 to manage. Even if you have </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> a small percentage of those, strongly consider using a </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpassword-manager%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=726528f8a79e0eae7b6f73e566fbd093601b6e30a3c529c501962b3ba22e34f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">password manager</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. A good choice will generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts and store them securely for you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In general, avoid simple passwords that people can guess or easily glean from other sources (like your birthday, your child’s birthday, the name of your pet, and so on). Additionally, make them unique from account to account. That’s can save you major headaches if one account gets compromised and a hacker tries to use the same password on another account. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you want to set up your own passwords, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fthe-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=726528f8a79e0eae7b6f73e566fbd093601b6e30a3c529c501962b3ba22e34f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">check out this article</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> on how you can make them strong and unique.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Use two-factor authentication to protect your accounts</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What exactly is two-factor authentication? It’s an extra layer of defense for your accounts. In practice, it means that in addition to providing a password, you also receive a special one-time-use code to access your account. That code </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be sent to you via email or to your phone by text. In some cases, you can also receive that code by a call to your phone. Basically, two-factor authentication combines two things: something you know, like your password; and something you have, like your smartphone. Together, that makes it tougher for scammers to hack into your accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Two-factor authentication is practically a standard, so much so that you already might be using it right now when you bank or use certain accounts. If not, you can see if your bank offers it as an option in your settings the next time you log in.

No two phishing emails look alike. They can range from a request from a stranger posing as a lawyer who wants you to </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">help</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with a bank transfer—to an announcement about (phony) lottery </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">winnings.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> “Just send us your bank information and we’ll send your prize to you!” Those are a couple of classics. However, phishing emails have become much more sophisticated in recent years. Now, slicker hackers will pose as banks, online stores, and credit card companies, often using well-designed emails that look almost the same as the genuine article.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Of course, those emails are fakes. The links they embed in those emails lead you to them, so they can steal your personal info or redirect a payment their way. One telltale sign of a phishing email is if the sender used an address that slightly alters the brand name or adds to it by tacking extra language at the end of it. If you get one of these emails, don’t click any of the links. Contact the institute in question using a phone number or address posted on their official website. This is a good </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">guideline</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> in general. The best avenue of communication is the one you’ve used and trusted before.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be skeptical about calls as well.

In fact, they rely on the fact that many still see the phone as a trusted line of communication. This is known as “vishing,” which is short for “voice phishing.” The aim is the same as it is with phishing. The fraudster is looking to lure you into a bogus financial transaction or attempting to steal information, whether that’s financial, personal, or both. They </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> call you directly, posing as your bank or even as tech support from a well-known company, or they </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> send you a text or email that directs you to call their number.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, a crook </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> call and introduce themselves as being part of your bank or credit card company with a line like “there are questions about your account” or something similar. In these cases, politely hang up. Next, call your bank or credit card company to follow up on your own. If the initial call was legitimate, you’ll quickly find out and can handle the issue properly. If you get a call from a scammer, they can be very persuasive. Remember, though. You’re in charge. You can absolutely hang up and then follow up using a phone number you trust.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Steer clear of financial transactions on public Wi-Fi in cafes, hotels, and libraries</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s a good reason not to use public Wi-Fi: it’s not private. They’re public networks, and that means they’re unsecure and shared by everyone who’s using it, which allows hackers to read any data passing along it like an open book. That includes your accounts and passwords if you’re doing any banking or shopping on it. The best advice here is to wait and handle those things at home if possible. (Or connect to public Wi-Fi with a VPN service, which we’ll cover below in a moment.) </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If not, you can always use your smartphone’s data connection to create a personal hotspot for your laptop, which will be far more secure. Another option is to use your smartphone alone. With a combination of your phone’s data connection and an app from your bank, you can take care of business that way instead of using public Wi-Fi. That said, be aware of your physical surroundings too. Make sure no one is looking over your shoulder!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protecting your banking and finances even further</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some basic digital hygiene will go a long way toward protecting you even more—not </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> your banking and finances, but all the things you do online as well.

Update your devices.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Manufacturers often advise consumers to update their software to the latest version and enable further security features. Updating your devices regularly increases the chances that you’ll receive security improvements soon after they become available. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Do not connect to your smart cameras, baby monitors, and other devices through public Wi-Fi.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Accessing these devices via a smartphone app from an unprotected network can compromise the security of your devices. Use a VPN or a secure cellular data connection instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Use strong, unique passwords.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Every device of yours should have one, along with a unique username to go along with it. </span><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-passwords-for-more-than-500000-servers-routers-and-iot-devices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">In some cases, connected devices ship with default usernames and passwords, making them that much easier to hack</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further protect your connected cameras, baby monitors, and other devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With those immediate steps in place, this security advisory offers you a chance to take a fresh look at your network and device security overall. With these straightforward steps in place, you’ll be  more protected against such events in the future—not to mention more secure in general. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Use two-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our banks, many of the online shopping sites we use, and numerous other accounts use </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/authentication-methods-101/?hilite=%27two-factor%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">two-factor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to help validate that we’re who we say we are when logging in. In short, a username and password combo is an example of one-factor authentication. The second factor in the mix is something you, and only you, own or control, like your mobile phone. Thus, when you log in and get a prompt to enter a security code that’s sent to your mobile phone, you’re taking advantage of two-factor authentication. If your IoT device supports two-factor authentication as part of the login procedure, put it to use and get that extra layer of security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Secure your internet router</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Your router acts as the internet’s gateway into your home. From there, it works as a hub that connects all your devices—computers, tablets, and phones, along with your IoT devices as well. That means it’s vital to keep your router secure. A quick word about routers: you typically access them via a browser window and a specific address that’s usually printed somewhere on your router. Whether you’re renting your router through your internet provider or have purchased one, the internet provider’s “how to” guide or router documentation can step you through this process.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The first thing to do is change the default password of your router if you haven’t done so already. Again, use </span><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">a strong method of password creation</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Also, change the name of your router. When you choose a new one, go with name that doesn’t give away your address or identity. Something unique and even fun like “Pizza Lovers” or “The Internet Warehouse” are options that mask your identity and are memorable for you too. While you’re making that change, you can also check that your router is using an encryption method, like WPA2, which helps secure communications to and from your router. If you’re unsure what to do, reach out to your internet provider or router manufacturer.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Set up a guest network specifically for your IoT devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just as you can offer your human guests secure access that’s separate from your own devices, creating an additional network on your router allows you to keep your computers and smartphones separate from IoT devices. This way, if an IoT device is compromised, a hacker will still have difficulty accessing your other devices, like computers and smartphones, along with the data and info that you have stored on them. You may also want to consider investing in </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">an advanced internet router that has built-in protection</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and can secure and monitor any device that connects to your network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

If there’s a setting that lets you receive automatic updates, enable it so that you always have the latest.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

In some cases, users received ransom notes for the return of their hacked accounts.</p>\n<p>It appears that LinkedIn is weathering a wave of brute-force attacks. This type of attack works much like it sounds—hackers try to force their way into accounts by guessing passwords. With powerful hacking apps, they can guess millions of passwords in seconds.</p>\n<p>As a result, one of two things is happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LinkedIn users receive an official, legitimate email from LinkedIn alerting them that their account has been locked due to unusual activity. This measure likely kicked in because of a brute force attack or because the attack occurred on an account using two-factor authentication. In this case, the account wasn&#8217;t compromised. However, these users then must reactivate their accounts per instructions provided by LinkedIn.</li>\n<li>Users try to log in and find that their password has been changed. Effectively, their account has been hacked. Reports show that some of these accounts get deleted. In other cases, the hacker changes the account’s email to an address using the “rambler.ru” domain, which makes the account unrecoverable by the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the scope, scale, and consistent use of the rambler.ru domain, this has all the signs of an organized attack. As of this writing, no group has claimed credit.</p>\n<h2><strong>How quickly can someone hack my password with a brute force attack?</strong></h2>\n<p>If any event underscores the need for strong, unique passwords, this is it.</p>\n<p>Given today’s computing power, the password generators hackers use for brute force attacks can create millions of passwords in seconds. Weak passwords have no chance against them. It’s a simple matter of statistics.</p>\n<p>Consider a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/create-strong-passwords-with-a-password-generator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password</a> that uses eight numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols. Sounds pretty strong, right? Unfortunately, a brute force attack might crack that password in as fast as one second.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">\n<h3><strong>Password Length</strong></h3>\n<h5><strong>(Using numbers, uppercase </strong><strong>and lowercase letters, and symbols)</strong></h5>\n</td>\n<td width=\"216\">\n<h3><strong>Time to Crack </strong><strong>the Password</strong></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">8</td>\n<td width=\"216\">One Second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">12</td>\n<td width=\"216\">Eight Months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"204\">16</td>\n<td width=\"216\">16 Million Years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, increase that password length to twelve numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols—it’d that eight months to crack that password. Bump it up to 16, and it would take 16 million years. The longer it is, the more complex it is. And thus tougher to crack. It’s the difference between one second and 16 million years. And if a hacker’s brute force attack on one password takes too long, it’ll simply move onto the next one.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to protect yourself from the LinkedIn attacks.</strong></h2>\n<p>Log into your LinkedIn account now and verify that it’s indeed secure. Then, take the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication.</strong> You’ll find this in your security settings. Using two-factor authentication makes hacking your account far, far more difficult than hacking it with password protection alone.</li>\n<li><strong>Set a new password.</strong> Make it strong and unique, using numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols. As illustrated above, the longer the better—14 or even up to 16 characters.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm your contact email.</strong> LinkedIn will alert users of unusual activity. Ensure that the contact information in your account profile uses an email address that you regularly check.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to create your own strong, unique password. One that you can still remember.</strong></h2>\n<p>Fourteen characters? Even up to 16 characters? How do you create that without just mashing on your keyboard? (Not recommended.) A layered password can do the work. It’s a way of creating a phrase and turning it into a strong, unique password that you can still remember.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick a phrase that is memorable for you: </strong>Don’t use easily discovered information, like your birthdate or pet’s name. Try something linked with an interest or hobby. If you’re an avid runner, you might choose a phrase like, “Running 26.2 Rocks!”</li>\n<li><strong>Replace letters with numbers and symbols: </strong>Remove the spaces. Then, you can put symbols and numbers in the place of some of the letters. Runn1ng26.2R0ck$!</li>\n<li><strong>Include a mix of letter cases: </strong>Finally, you want lower and uppercase letters that aren&#8217;t in a clear pattern. Algorithms know how to look for common patterns like <em>camelCase</em> or <em>PascalCase</em>. Runn1NG26.2R0cK$!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, you have a 17-character password that challenges hackers and that’s still something you can remember.</p>\n<h2><strong>Or, have a password manager handle the strong, unique passwords for you.</strong></h2>\n<p>Granted, creating strong, unique passwords for dozens and dozens of accounts can take a bit of time. (To put it mildly.) It can take yet more time if you manage them, such as if change them regularly (which can help protect you from data breaches and brute force attacks like this one at LinkedIn). Here, a password manager can help.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager/?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> can create, memorize, and store strong, unique passwords. It’ll use the random numbers, letters, and characters we mentioned earlier. The passwords won’t be memorable, but the manager does the memorizing for you. You can also use it to update passwords regularly. In a time of data breaches, this offers you extra protection. Taken together, every account you have gets powerful password protection when you hand the job over to a password manager.</p>\n<h2><strong>Log in now and secure your LinkedIn account.</strong></h2>\n<p>This wave of attacks reminds us just how powerful, or weak, our passwords can be. A strong, unique password in conjunction with two-factor authentication stands as your best defense as LinkedIn weathers these attacks. Strengthen your security.</p>\n<p>Strengthen your other accounts as well. Hackers target websites and platforms of all sizes, and not every attack makes the headlines. Strong security measures for each of your accounts will protect you best if you end up as a hacker’s target.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-safeguard-your-linkedin-account-and-strengthen-your-security/\">How to Safeguard Your LinkedIn Account and Strengthen Your Security</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Be on the Lookout for Scam Tech Support Calls","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/lookout-scam-tech-support-calls/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 14:30:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybercrime"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://blogs.mcafee.com/?p=52683"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/300x200_Blog_081823-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Instead of getting you out of a jam, tech support scams get you into one.

And they can get costly.</p>\n<p>Tech support scammers had a banner year in 2022. They raked in more than $800 million in the U.S. alone, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FBI</a>’s list of reported cases. The actual figure climbs higher when you factor in all the unreported cases. And it goes yet higher still when you consider all the victims worldwide.</p>\n<p>In all, tech support scams make up a multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>\n<p>They make their money several ways. Sometimes the scammers who run them charge large fees to fix a non-existent problem. Other times, they’ll install information-stealing malware under the guise of software that’s supposed to correct an issue. In some cases, they’ll ask for remote access to your computer to perform a diagnosis, but access your computer to steal information instead. Or they could hit you with several of the above.</p>\n<p>You can stumble across these scams on your own as you go about your day online. Other times, they find you, such as when the scammer calls you directly.</p>\n<p>One of our employees shared his story when a tech support scammer called his wife out of the blue:</p>\n<p>I was messing around on my computer before dinner. My wife came in with a strange look on her face as she told the person on the phone, “I think you might want to talk to my husband about that.” Once on the phone I was greeted with, “Hi, this is Rick from Windows support and we’re calling because your computer is sending junk files to the internet.” I knew there was no way he was from “Windows support” since a reputable company isn’t going to call me up out of the blue like this, but as a security researcher I was curious, so I jumped right in.</p>\n<p>“Rick” said that to fix my issue he needed me to install a free remote access tool and give him access to my system. Letting an unknown person access my actual computer seemed like a bad idea, so I let him log on to a “virtual machine” that I use for security testing. The first thing he did was turn off my security software, including the antivirus and firewall. After doing that, he downloaded a file that he tried to install. Since I had additional security software in place he wasn’t aware of, the installation failed each time he tried to run it. At this point, I had the file he was trying to install, the IP address he was connecting from, and the site he used to get the malicious file. I told “Rick” that I work for a security company and would like to know what he was actually looking for. I’m fairly certain he hung up before I completed my sentence.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, after the call, a malware scan confirmed that “Rick” wanted to install a remote access tool (RAT) that would have given him full control of the computer.</p>\n<p>That’s one example of how these scams go. They get costly too. The FBI further reported that the average loss for a tech support scam approached $25,000. In some <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-tech-support-scammers-targeting-financial-accounts-using-remote-desktop-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cases</a>, pop-up “security alert” ads spearheaded scams that cost people $200,000 and upwards to $1 million.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these scams are rather easy to spot. And avoid. If you know what to look for.</p>\n<h2><strong> What do tech support scams look like?</strong></h2>\n<p>Let’s start with a quick overview of tech support scams. They tend to work in two primary ways.</p>\n<h3><strong>First, there are the scams that track you down.</strong></h3>\n<p>This might be a phone call that comes from someone posing as a rep from “Microsoft” or “Apple.” The scammer on the other end of the line will tell you that there’s something wrong with your computer or device. Something <em>urgently </em>wrong. And then offers a bogus solution to the bogus problem, often at a high cost. Similarly, they might reach you by way of a pop-up ad. Again telling you that your computer or device needs urgent repairs. These can find you a few different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By clicking on links from unsolicited emails.</li>\n<li>From pop-up ads from risky sites.</li>\n<li>Via pop-ups from otherwise legitimate sites that have had malicious ads injected.</li>\n<li>By way of spammy phone calls made directly to you, whether by <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/smartphone-security-five-steps-beating-and-blocking-robocalls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robocall</a> or a live operator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Second, there are the scams that lie in wait. </strong></h3>\n<p>These are phony services and sites that pose as legitimate tech support but are anything but. They’ll place search ads, post other ads on social media, and so forth, ready for you to look up and get in touch with when you have a problem that you need fixed. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online classified ads, forum posts, and blog sites.</li>\n<li>Ads on Social media sites such as Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, and Tumblr.</li>\n<li>Search results—scammers place paid search ads too!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to spot and avoid tech support scams</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With regards to ads and search results, keep an eye open for typos, awkward language, or poor design and logos that look like they could be a knockoff of a trusted brand. Check our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/top-tips-to-spot-tech-support-scams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top tips to spot tech support scams</a> of what these ads and search results look like.</li>\n<li>Don’t fall for the call. If someone calls you with an offer of “tech support.” Chances are, it’s a scam. And if they ask for payment in gift cards or cryptocurrency like bitcoin, it’s absolutely a scam. Just hang up.</li>\n<li>Note that big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft <em>won&#8217;t call you </em>with offers of tech support or an alert that “something is wrong with your computer.” Such calls come from imposters. Moreover, in many cases, the company will offer free support as part of your purchase or subscription that you can get on your own when you need it. (For example, <a href=\"https://service.mcafee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that’s the case with our products</a>.)</li>\n<li>Don’t click or tap on any links or call any numbers that suddenly appear on your screen and warn you of a computer problem. Again, this is a likely sign of an attempted scam. Often, this will happen while browsing. Simply close your browser and open a fresh browser window to clear the ad or link.</li>\n<li>Go to the source. Contact the company directly for support, manually type their address into your browser, or call the number that came with the packaging or purchase. Don’t search. This will help you avoid imposters that clog up search results with bogus ads.</li>\n<li>Protect your browsing. Use a web protection extension that can spot malicious sites and help prevent you from clicking on them by mistake. Comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online protection software</a> will offer protection for your browsing, in addition to protection from malware and viruses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-remove-personal-information-from-data-broker-sites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Remove your personal info from data broker sites</a>. How did that scammer get your phone number in the first place? Scammers often purchase personal information in bulk from data broker sites, which can include your phone number. Our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> can help you remove your information from some of the riskiest data broker sites out there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, a good piece of general advice is to keep your devices and apps up to date. Regular updates often include security fixes and improvements that can help keep scammers and hackers at bay. You can set your devices and apps to download them automatically. And if you need to get an update or download on your own, get it from the company’s official website. Stay away from third-party sites that might host <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malware</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>What to do if you think you’ve been scammed:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change your passwords.</strong> This will provide protection if the scammer was able to access your account passwords in some form. While this can be a big task, it’s a vital one. A <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">password manager</a> that’s part of <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comprehensive online protection</a> can make it much easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Run a malware and virus scan right away.</strong> Delete files or apps that the software says is an issue. Do the same for other devices on your network too. Experienced and determined scammers can infect them as well by gaining access to one device on your network.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop payment.</strong> Contact your bank, credit card company, or online payment platform to reverse the charges. File a fraud complaint as well. The sooner you act, the better chance you have of recovering some or all your money. (Note that this is a good reason to use credit cards for online purchases, as they afford extra protection that debit cards and other payment services don&#8217;t.)</li>\n<li><strong>Report the scam.</strong> In the U.S., you can contact the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commission</a>, which reports the claim to thousands of law enforcement agencies. While they can&#8217;t resolve your individual issue, your report can help with broader investigations and build a case against scammers—which can make the internet safer for others. <a href=\"https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Their list of FAQs</a> is particularly helpful too, answering important questions like “how do I get my money back?”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/lookout-scam-tech-support-calls/\">Be on the Lookout for Scam Tech Support Calls</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"How Secure is Video Conferencing?","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-secure-is-video-conferencing/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 17 Aug 2023 14:20:27 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"network security"},{"#cdata-section":"computer security"},{"#cdata-section":"data protection"},{"#cdata-section":"internet security"},{"#cdata-section":"cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"vulnerability"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"/blogs/?p=99533"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/300x200_Blog_081723.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/300x200_Blog_081723.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/300x200_Blog_081723-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>For millions of people, it’s not a workday without it—video conferencing.

In recent years, we’ve seen fake news creators slap a new headline on a new photo, all to make it seem like it’s something current. Once again, a quick search can help you tell if it’s fake or not. Try a reverse image search and see what comes up. Is the photo indeed current? Who took it? When? Where?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Check your emotions too</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Has a news story you’ve read or watched ever made you shake your fist at the screen or want to clap and cheer? How about something that made you fearful or simply laugh? Bits of content that evoke strong emotional responses tend to spread quickly, whether they’re articles, a post, or even a tweet. That’s a ready sign that a quick fact check </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be in order. The content is clearly playing to your biases.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s a good reason for that. Bad actors who wish to foment unrest, unease, or spread disinformation use emotionally driven content to plant a seed. Whether or not their original story gets picked up and viewed firsthand doesn’t matter to these bad actors. Their aim is to get some manner of disinformation out into the ecosystem. They rely on others who will re-post, re-tweet, or otherwise pass it along on their behalf—to the point where the original source of the information gets completely lost. This is one instance where people readily begin to accept certain information as fact, even if it’s not factual at all.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Certainly, some legitimate articles will generate a response as well, yet it’s a good habit to do a quick fact check and confirm what you’ve read. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Expand your media diet</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A single information source or story won’t provide a complete picture. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> only cover a topic from a certain angle or narrow focus. Likewise, information sources are helmed by editors and stories are written by people—all of whom have their biases, whether overt or subtle. It’s for this reason that expanding your media diet to include a broad range of information sources is so important.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, see what other information sources have to say on the same topic. Consuming news across a spectrum will expose you to thoughts and coverage you might not otherwise get if you keep your consumption to a handful of sources.

Advances in AI give images a clarity and crispness that they didn’t have before, deepfake videos play more smoothly, and voice cloning gets uncannily accurate. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet even with the best AI, scammers often leave their fingerprints all over the fake news content they create.

There’s often text or a larger article around them. Inspect the text for typos, poor grammar, and overall poor composition. Look to see if the text even makes sense. And like legitimate news articles, does it include identifying information—like date, time, and place of publication, along with the author’s name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Evaluate the claim</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does the image seem too bizarre to be real? Too good to be true? Today, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet,” now includes “Don’t believe everything you see on the internet.” If a fake news story is claiming to be real, search for the headline elsewhere. If it’s truly noteworthy, other known and reputable sites will report on the event—and have done their own fact-checking.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3) Check for distortions</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The bulk of AI technology still renders fingers and hands poorly.

So, if you invest a lot of real money into your characters, be especially vigilant and follow these five important tips to protect your online accounts. </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Do not reveal personal information</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s common for gamers to use variations of their real names and birthdates in their public-facing usernames. Doing this could reveal personal information that you’d rather keep private. Consider using a nickname or a combination of random numbers instead. Along this same vein, don’t reveal personal details about yourself (phone number, hometown, places you visit regularly, etc.) on chats or streams. Lurking cybercriminals can gather these personal details to impersonate you. </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Edit your privacy settings</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">On some online PC games, you can join campaigns with gamers from all over the world. While the interconnectivity is great, carefully vet who you allow to follow your online profile. If a stranger sends a friend request out of the blue, be on alert. They could have nefarious motives, such as phishing for valuable data. It’s best to customize your privacy settings to make your profile invisible to strangers.  </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Don’t pirate games or download cheat software</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Developers spend a lot of time creating amazing games, so make sure you purchase games legally and play them as they are intended. Research revealed that cracked versions – or unauthorized versions – of popular games sometimes hid ChromeLoader malware, which has the ability to steal credentials stored in internet browsers. Cracked versions of Call of Duty, Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Roblox were found to be harboring malware.<sup>2</sup> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Be especially wary of free downloads and cheat software.

Our cars are no longer just pieces of mechanical engineering but have evolved into highly advanced machines equipped with state-of-the-art computer systems. From engine performance to preventive maintenance and from passenger comfort to safety assistance, the computer software in our cars control a vast array of operations.</p>\n<p>However, just like any other technological device, car computer systems aren&#8217;t immune to cyber threats. Cybersecurity attacks on cars can pose serious safety threats and privacy issues, with hackers potentially taking control of vehicle functions or stealing personal data. This brings us to an essential question &#8211; how secure is your car&#8217;s computer software?</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Threat Landscape</h2>\n<p>There are several possible instances where a cyber attack could take place. For example, software vulnerabilities could allow hackers to access the car&#8217;s system and manipulate its operations. Additionally, insecure network interfaces can be exploited to introduce malicious code or extract sensitive information. Thus, understanding where these vulnerabilities lie is the first step towards enhancing your car&#8217;s computer software security.</p>\n<h3>The Rise of Connected Cars</h3>\n<p>With the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-to-secure-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things/\">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, our cars are becoming more connected than ever before. Modern vehicles have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, GPS navigation systems, and even mobile applications allowing us to interact remotely with our cars. While these features enhance convenience and improve driving experiences, they also introduce new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit.</p>\n<p>Just as your smartphone or computer can be attacked by malware or hackers, so can your car&#8217;s computer system. Sophisticated cybercriminals can potentially breach the car&#8217;s software to manipulate vehicle functions, steal personal data, or even take complete control of the vehicle. The threat is even greater with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles that rely heavily on software systems.</p>\n<h3>The Reality of Car Hacking</h3>\n<p>Car hacking may seem like a concept straight out of a science fiction movie, but it&#8217;s a harsh reality in today&#8217;s technologically advanced world. Various demonstrations by security researchers have proven the vulnerability of car computer systems. In some cases, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/21/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-engine-on-highway.html\">hackers could remotely kill a car&#8217;s engine</a>, disable brakes, or take control of steering — all of these while the car was in motion.</p>\n<p>The risk doesn&#8217;t stop at vehicle control. Many car owners sync their smartphones with their car systems, allowing access to personal data such as contacts, messages, or even GPS history. A successful breach could give hackers access to this sensitive information, resulting in privacy issues or <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html\">identity theft</a>.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Your Car’s Computer Software Secure</h2>\n<p>Car manufacturers play a crucial role in ensuring the cybersecurity of their vehicles. They are responsible for designing and implementing security measures right from the initial stages of vehicle design. This includes adopting secure coding practices, conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, and providing regular software updates to address any identified security flaws.</p>\n<p>At McAfee, we are actively collaborating with various car manufacturers to help identify potential weak points in their vehicle computer systems. By proactively addressing these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, we aim to better safeguard our customers&#8217; vehicles against potential cyber threats.</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Regular Software Updates</h3>\n<p>Just like your smartphone or computer, the software in your car needs regular updates. These updates not only provide new features and enhancements but also patch security vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit. Ignoring these updates can leave your car&#8217;s computer system open to potential cyber-attacks.</p>\n<p>Ensuring your vehicle&#8217;s software is up-to-date is always a good practice. Most modern cars will notify you when a software update is available, or you can check with your car manufacturer or dealership. While it may seem like a hassle, updating your car&#8217;s software can go a long way in keeping it secure.</p>\n<h2>Practical Steps Towards Car Computer Software Security</h2>\n<p>While car manufacturers are responsible for creating secure systems, users also share the responsibility for maintaining the security of their vehicle&#8217;s computer software. Keeping up-to-date with the fast-paced progress in cybersecurity can help in preventing possible threats.</p>\n<h3>Adopting Defensive Driving For Your Car&#8217;s Computer</h3>\n<p>Just as defensive driving helps you anticipate potential hazards on the road, adopting a defensive mindset towards your car&#8217;s computer software can help protect it against potential cyber threats. Familiarize yourself with your car&#8217;s digital features and understand what each does. Engage with these systems conscientiously and avoid reckless behavior, such as downloading suspicious apps or clicking on suspicious links that may appear on your car&#8217;s infotainment system.</p>\n<p>You should also consider using a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/\">strong, unique password</a> for any connected apps or services you use with your car. Many hacking attempts are made possible because users re-use passwords across multiple services, making it easier for cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access.</p>\n<h3>Using Antivirus and Firewalls</h3>\n<p>While it may seem odd to think of installing <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html\">antivirus software</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/firewall.html\">firewall</a> in your car, these traditional computer protection methods could soon become standard practice in vehicle cybersecurity. Just like how these tools protect your computer or smartphone, they can also safeguard your car&#8217;s computer system by detecting and blocking potential threats.</p>\n<p>Some car manufacturers and cybersecurity companies are already exploring the development of such protective tools specifically for cars. Until these become widely available, you can reduce risk by being cautious about what devices you connect to your car and what data you share through its systems.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Car Software Security</h2>\n<p>The future of car software security is evolving with the advancement in technology. Car manufacturers and cybersecurity companies continually work together to create robust security systems and innovate techniques to prevent potential threats.</p>\n<h3>Towards More Secure Autonomous Vehicles</h3>\n<p>Autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, represent the next frontier in vehicle technology. They rely heavily on software systems to function, making them prime targets for potential cyberattacks. However, they also present a unique opportunity to develop more advanced security measures.</p>\n<p>Several autonomous vehicle manufacturers are at the forefront of cybersecurity innovation, integrating robust security measures into their cars&#8217; software right from the design phase. These include advanced encryption methods, intrusion detection systems, and even artificial intelligence that can learn and adapt to new threats. While these solutions aren&#8217;t foolproof, they represent important steps towards a more secure future for autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Increased Regulatory Oversight</h3>\n<p>As cars become more connected, regulatory authorities worldwide are beginning to note the associated security risks. New laws and regulations are being developed to ensure car manufacturers take cybersecurity seriously and have measures in place to safeguard their customers&#8217; data and safety.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/09/2022-19507/cybersecurity-best-practices-for-the-safety-of-modern-vehicles\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has released cybersecurity best practices</a> for modern vehicles in the United States. Such guidelines aim to standardize security measures across the auto industry and ensure all manufacturers are committed to protecting their customers&#8217; security.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Advancements in car computer software have transformed our driving experiences, offering increased convenience and performance. However, with these benefits come new cybersecurity challenges. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the threat landscape expands, highlighting the urgent need for robust vehicle cybersecurity measures.</p>\n<p>Securing your car&#8217;s computer software requires awareness, proactive behavior, and the adoption of new security technology. Car manufacturers, security experts, and regulatory authorities all have a role to play in this evolving field. However, as an individual, staying informed about potential risks and remaining vigilant in your usage of digital car features is a crucial first step towards protecting your car and your data from cyber threats.</p>\n<p>Remember, security is a continuous journey, not a destination.

These tips will get you started: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1) Don’t pick up—and if you do, don’t say “yes” </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This straightforward piece of advice can actually get a little tricky. We mentioned spoofing, and certain forms of it can get rather exact. Sophisticated spoofing can make a call appear to come from someone you know. Yet more run-of-the-mill spoofing will often use a form of “neighbor spoofing.” The scammers will use a local area code or the same prefix of your phone number to make it seem more familiar. In short, you might answer one of these calls by mistake. I</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">f</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you do answer, never say “yes.” </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Similarly</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sophisticated scammers will record </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a victim&#8217;s</span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">voice</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for use in other scams. That can include trying to hack into credit card accounts by using the company’s phone tree. Recordings of slightly longer lengths can also lead to voice cloning using AI-driven tools.

Good chance they got it from a data broker site. Data brokers collect and sell personal information of thousands and even millions of individuals. They gather them from public sources, public records, and from third parties as well—like data gathered from smartphone apps and shopping habits from supermarket club cards. And for certain, phone numbers are often in that mix. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b5e00ee9de7241e67e32595250a0d373bd2a4c6d4aecc8a98d5e81475d3de94e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our Personal Data Cleanup can help.</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> It scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info.

While these apps can indeed block spam calls, they might have privacy issues. Which is ironic when you’re basically trying to protect your privacy with these apps in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These apps might collect information, such as your contact list, usage data, and other information about your phone. As with any app, the key resides in the user agreement. It should tell you what information the app might collect and why. It should also tell you if this information is shared with or sold to third parties. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What’s at risk?

They’ll dupe the victim’s friends and followers with scams. They’ll flood feeds with misinformation. And they’ll steal all kinds of personal information—not to mention photos and chats in DMs. In all, a stolen social media account could lead to fraud, blackmail, and other crimes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet you have a strong line of defense that can prevent it from happening to you: multi-factor authentication (MFA).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">MFA goes by other names, such as two-factor authentication and two-step verification. Yet they all boost your account security in much the same way. They add an extra step or steps to the login process. Extra evidence to prove that you are, in fact, you. It’s in addition to the usual username/password combination, thus the “multi-factor” in multi-factor authentication. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Examples of MFA include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sending a one-time code via a text or phone call, often seen when logging into bank and credit card accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sending a one-time code to an authentication app, such as when logging into a gaming service.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Asking for the answer to a security question, like the name of your elementary school or the model of your first car.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Biometric information, like a fingerprint or facial scan.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With MFA, a hacker needs more than just your username and password to weasel their way into your account.

Protect all devices with unique, hard-to-guess passwords. Even better, enable biometric passwords, such as fingerprint or face ID. These are the hardest passwords to crack and can keep the information inside lost or stolen devices safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Don’t Share Passwords</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Streaming services host the most buzzworthy shows. All their friends may be raving about the latest episodes of a zombie thriller or sci-fi visual masterpiece, but alas: Your family doesn’t have a subscription to the streaming service. Cash-conscious college students especially may attempt to save money on streaming by sharing passwords to various platforms. Alert your children to the dangers of doing so. Sharing a password with a trusted best friend might not seem like a cyberthreat, but if they share it with a friend who then shares it with someone else who may not be so trustworthy, you just handed the keys to a criminal to walk right in and help themselves to your PII stored on the streaming service’s dashboard.    </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once the cybercriminal has your streaming service password, they may then attempt to use it to break into other sensitive online accounts. Criminals bank on people reusing the same passwords across various accounts. So, make sure that your children always keep their passwords to themselves and have unique passwords for every account. If they’re having a difficult time remembering dozens of passwords, sign them up for a password manager that can store passwords securely.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Keep Some Details a Mystery on Social Media</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Walk down any city or suburban street, and you’re likely to see at least one Gen Zer filming themselves doing the latest dance trend or taking carefully posed pictures with their friends to share on social media. According to one survey, 76% of Gen Zers use Instagram and 71% are on social media for three hours or more every day.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> And while they’re on social media, your children are likely posting details about their day. Some details – like what they ate for breakfast – are innocent. But when kids start posting pictures or details about where they go to school, where they practice sports, and geotagging their home addresses, this opens them up to identity fraud or stalking. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Encourage your children to keep some personal details to themselves, especially their full names, full birthdates, address, and where they go to school. For their social media handles, suggest they go by a nickname and omit their birthyear. Also, it’s best practice to keep social media accounts set to private. If they have aspirations to become the internet’s next biggest influencer or video star, they can create a public account that’s sparse on the personal details.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

Breaks from social media platforms are healthy, so consider having the whole family join in on a family-wide social media vacation. Instead of everyone scrolling on their phones on a weeknight, replace that time with a game night instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

School is all about learning, and the more a student cheats, the less they learn. Lessons often build off previous units, so if a student cheats on one test, future learning is built upon a shaky foundation of previous knowledge. Also, students should be careful about using AI as a background research tool, as it isn’t always accurate.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

While it used to be as simple as limiting TV time, they now deal with monitoring many forms of technology. From eyes glued to smartphones all day to hours spent playing video games, kids are immersed in technology.</p>\n<p>Safe technology use doesn’t come as second nature — it needs to be taught. As a parent, the issues of when to get your child a phone, too much screen time and online harassment are top of mind. To address these concerns, it’s important to set boundaries and teach safe technology use. One way to do this is by creating a family media agreement or contract.</p>\n<p>Family device agreements help teach proper technology use and set expectations. They allow you to start an open conversation with your kids and encourage them to be part of the decision making. By creating a family device agreement, your kids will know their boundaries and have concrete consequences for breaking them.</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In today&#8217;s parenting, you may want to consider creating a <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/McAfeeDeviceAgreement.pdf\">McAfee Family Device Agreement</a>. The most important thing is to have an agreement that is suitable for your kids’ ages and maturity and one that works for your family’s schedule. There’s no point making your kids sign an agreement that limits their time on Instagram when they’re probably quite happy visiting only the online sites that you have ‘bookmarked’ for them. </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gear Up for a Safe School Year</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While diligence and good cyber habits can lessen the impact of many of these 10 threats, a cybersecurity protection service gives parents and their students valuable peace of mind that their devices and online privacy are safe. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+ Ultimate Family Plan</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is the all-in-one device, privacy, and identity protection service that allows the whole family to live confidently online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Morning Consult, “</span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmorningconsult.com.mcas.ms%2F2022%2F12%2F12%2Fgen-z-social-media-usage%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Gen Z Is Extremely Online</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/10-back-to-school-tech-tips-for-kids-teens-and-college-students/\">10 Back-to-School Tech Tips for Kids, Teens and College Students</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Season of Back to School Scams","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/the-season-of-back-to-school-scams/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"pubDate":"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 19:26:50 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=172177"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Authored by: Lakshya Mathur and Yashvi Shah  As the Back-to-School season approaches, scammers are taking advantage of the opportunity to...</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/the-season-of-back-to-school-scams/\">The Season of Back to School Scams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_052223-2-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p>Authored by: <span class=\"TextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Subtitle\">Lakshya Mathur</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Subtitle\"> and Yashvi Shah</span></span><span class=\"EOP SCXW97233454 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As the Back-to-School season approaches, scammers are taking advantage of the opportunity to deceive parents and students with various scams.

Scrolling through your social media feed and breaking news sites, all the mentions of artificial intelligence and its uses makes the online world feel like a lawless free-for-all. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While your school or workplace may have rules against using AI for projects, as of yet there are very few laws regulating the usage of mainstream AI content generation tools. As the technology advances are laws likely to follow? Let’s explore.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What AI Laws Exist?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As of August 2023, there are no specific laws in the United States governing the general public’s usage of AI. For example, there are no explicit laws banning someone from making a </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fai-in-the-hands-of-cybercriminals-how-to-spot-fake-art-and-deepfakes%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">deepfake</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> of a celebrity and posting it online. However, if a judge could construe the deepfake as defamation or if it was used as part of a scam, it could land the creator in hot water.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The White House issued a draft of an artificial intelligence bill of rights that outlines best practices for AI technologists. This document isn’t a law, though. It&#8217;s more of a list of suggestions to urge developers to make AI unbiased, as accurate as possible, and to not completely rely on AI when a human could perform the same job equally well.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The European Union is in the process of drafting the EU AI Act. Similar to the American AI Bill of Rights, the EU’s act is mostly directed toward the developers responsible for calibrating and advancing AI technology.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">China is one country that has formal regulations on the use of AI, specifically deepfake. A new law states that a person must give express consent to allow their faces to be used in a deepfake. Additionally, the law bans citizens from using deepfake to create fake news reports or content that could negatively affect the economy, national security, or China’s reputation. Finally, all deepfakes must include a disclaimer announcing that the content was synthesized.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">3</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Should AI Laws Exist in the Future?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As scammers, edgy content creators, and money-conscious executives push the envelope with deepfake, AI art, and text-generation tools, laws governing AI use may be key to stopping the spread of fake news and protect people’s livelihoods and reputations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Deepfake challenges the notion that “seeing is believing.” Fake news reports can be dangerous to society when they encourage unrest or spark widespread outrage. Without treading upon the freedom of speech, is there a way for the U.S. and other countries to regulate deepfake creators with intentions of spreading dissent? China’s mandate that deepfake content must include a disclaimer could be a good starting point.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) strikes are a prime example of how unbridled AI use could turn invasive and impact people’s jobs. In their new contract negotiations, each union included an AI clause. For the writers, they’re asking that AI-generated text not be allowed to write “literary material.” Actors are arguing against the widespread use of AI-replication of actors’ voices and faces. While deepfake could save (already rich) studios millions, these types of recreations could put actors out of work and would allow the studio to use the actors’ likeness in perpetuity without the actors’ consent.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">4</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Future laws around the use of AI will likely include clauses about consent and assuming the risk text generators introduce to any project.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Use AI Responsibly</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the meantime, while the world awaits more guidelines and firm regulations governing mainstream AI tools, the best way you can interact with </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fpros-and-cons-of-ai-in-daily-life%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">AI in daily life</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> is to do so responsibly and in moderation.

The World Wide Web (WWW) has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and explore, becoming an integral part of our daily lives. With the importance of the internet only growing stronger, it&#8217;s only fitting to honor the World Wide Web with a special day of commemoration. But with the internet comes risks, and it’s important to make sure your family is protected from potential threats. Here are some tips and tricks to keep your family safe online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Phishing Scam Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing scams are a type of fraud that involves sending emails or other messages that appear to be from a legitimate source. The goal of these messages is to trick users into providing personal information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and bank account details. To protect against phishing scams, teach your family to: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Be suspicious of any emails or messages that look suspicious, even if they appear to come from a legitimate source.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Verify the source of any email or message before responding.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Never provide any personal information in response to an email or message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Identity Scam Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Identity theft is a crime in which someone uses another person’s personal information to commit fraud or other crimes. Teach your family to protect against identity theft by: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Being aware of what personal information they share online.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Using secure passwords for all accounts.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Regularly monitoring their credit reports.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. VPN Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A virtual private network (VPN) is a type of technology that provides a secure connection to a private network over the internet. A VPN can help protect your family’s online activity by encrypting the data and hiding your online activity from others. To ensure your family’s online safety, teach them to: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Use a reliable VPN service.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Always connect to a VPN when accessing public Wi-Fi networks.</span></li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Be aware of the country or region in which their VPN service is located.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Password Protection</span></b></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strong passwords are an important part of online security. Teach your family to create strong passwords and to never share them with anyone. Additionally, use a password manager to store and manage your family’s passwords.

From the ability to catch up with friends and family across the globe to finding information about virtually any topic, the power of the internet is remarkable. In fact, the World Wide Web has significantly enriched our lives in countless ways.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Did you know that the first-ever image posted on the World Wide Web was a photo of Les Horribles Cernettes, a parody pop band founded by employees at CERN? It was uploaded in 1992 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who used a NeXT computer as the first-ever web server. And although we use the term &#8220;surfing the net&#8221; regularly, do you know who actually coined the phrase? A librarian by the name of Jean Armour Polly wrote an article titled &#8220;Surfing the Internet&#8221; in the Wilson Library Bulletin at the University of Minnesota in 1992.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are many other remarkable facts about the World Wide Web, including its growth over the years. By the start of the year 1993, there were only 50 servers worldwide, but that number had grown to over 500 by October of the same year. Advances in data compression enabled media streaming to happen over the web, which was previously impractical due to high bandwidth requirements for uncompressed media. Although the number of websites online was still small in comparison to today&#8217;s figure, notable sites such as Yahoo! Directory and Yahoo! Search were launched in 1994 and 1995, respectively, marking the beginning of web commerce.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On World Wide Web Day, you can celebrate by exploring the capabilities of the internet and discovering how it has changed over the years. Many organizations worldwide host events featuring conversations and interviews with technology leaders, entrepreneurs, and creators. There are also different talks, activities, and discussions online that you can join, allowing you to delve deeper into the history and potential of the World Wide Web. You could even consider running an event at your local business to market the day and celebrate what WWW has done for us all!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/world-wide-web-day-how-to-protect-your-family-online/\">World Wide Web Day: How to Protect Your Family Online</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"AI in the Wild: Malicious Applications of Mainstream AI Tools","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/ai-in-the-wild-malicious-applications-of-mainstream-ai-tools/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 08:46:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"ransomware"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"deepfakes"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=171872"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_072823-a-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>It’s not all funny limericks, bizarre portraits, and hilarious viral skits.

In Arizona, a fake kidnapping phone call caused several minutes of panic for one family, as a mother received a demand for ransom to release her alleged kidnapped daughter. On the phone, the mother heard a voice that sounded exactly like her child’s, but it turned out to be an AI-generated facsimile.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In reality, the daughter was not kidnapped.

Do your best to really listen to the “voice” of your loved one. AI voice technology is incredible, but there are still some kinks in the technology. For example, does the voice have unnatural hitches? Do words cut off just a little too early? Does the tone of certain words not quite match your loved one’s accent? To pick up on these small details, a level head is necessary.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What you can do as a family today to avoid falling for an AI vishing scam is to agree on a family password. This can be an obscure word or phrase that is meaningful to you. Keep this password to yourselves and never post about it on social media. This way, if a scammer ever calls you claiming to have or be a family member, this password could determine a fake emergency from a real one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2.

Before buying anything or investing your money with a business you found through an advertisement, conduct your own background research on the company.

Yet that’s what spyware effectively does while you’re online. Luckily, you can do plenty to keep spyware from winding up on your devices.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is Spyware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spyware secretly gathers information on you as you use your device. It’s a type of malware. Depending on its form, spyware can sniff out your surfing habits to serve up targeted ads—or it can record your keystrokes, which can steal your passwords and credit card numbers. In all, spyware skims your otherwise personal information and puts it into someone else’s hands.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spyware can end up on your device several ways. That includes clicking on a malicious attachment in an email, a download from a sketchy site, or via an app that you’ve downloaded yourself. Other sources of spyware include pirated video streams, illicit sharing sites (music, videos, games), and sketchy links passed along in social media and texts. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, bad actors simply install it on devices themselves if the device is unlocked and unattended.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can find spyware out there in the wild as well. Shared computers at hotels, libraries, and other public locations sometimes wind up with spyware on them. Hackers target these devices in the hopes that unsuspecting users will use them to go online and do a little banking or access otherwise sensitive information. That’s one more good reason to do your important business on your own trusted devices.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What are the Different Kinds of Spyware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Broadly speaking, spyware spans a range of uses. They can land anywhere from legitimate to questionable to outright illegal. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, some applications make it quite clear that they collect and share some usage data. Social media apps are a good example of this. While you might or might not be entirely comfortable with the data they collect, it’s legitimate. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other applications might not make their data collection policies clear, such as burying them in a user agreement—making it difficult for people to know what’s actually being collected. In other words, some app developers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> shroud just how much information and data they track.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Lastly, hackers and scammers will maliciously steal information, potentially with an app or by otherwise getting it installed on a victim’s device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Within this range of legitimate and illegal use, you’ll find different forms of spyware:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Adware</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> – As the name suggests, this form of spyware tracks user activity and sends it along to advertisers for targeted ad campaigns. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, this can take malicious forms that serve pop-up ads, which earn scammers money each time they get viewed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keyloggers and monitors</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> – These forms of spyware lurk in the background on devices and skim keystrokes as mentioned </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">above.

Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.

Increasingly, hackers and scammers go to great pains when they create their malicious websites. They take extra steps to make their sites look legit, when in fact </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">they&#8217;re</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> anything but. Certainly, plenty of other hackers and scammers slap together malicious sites that still look a bit roughshod, which makes them easier to spot.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So whether it’s a clever knockoff or a slapdash effort, unsafe websites of all kinds have several telltale signs you can spot. We’ll show you, and let’s start things off with what makes an unsafe website unsafe in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What’s an unsafe website?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Unsafe websites typically harbor one of two primary forms of attack—yet sometimes both:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Malware:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Hackers will use their sites to install malware on your device, often by tricking you into clicking or tapping on a download. They might tempt you with an offer, a prize, a show to stream—just about anything you might want to otherwise download. (Recently, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fscammers-love-barbie-fake-videos-promote-bogus-ticket-offers-that-steal-personal-info%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">we saw hackers installing malware on sites that offered to stream dubbed versions of the “Barbie” movie</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Another classic attack. Phishing involves scammers who try to hoodwink you into providing account or financial information. Common ruses include links in emails, texts, and DMs that appear to be urgent messages from streaming services, banks, social media, and other accounts. Of course, those messages are phony. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As a result, unsafe websites can lead to some not-so-good things.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What can happen if you visit an unsafe website?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On the malware side, attackers can install spyware and similar apps that siphon financial and personal information from your device while you’re using it. Other malware might steal files outright or maliciously delete them altogether. Ransomware remains a major concern today as well, where attackers hold devices and data hostage. And even if victims end up paying the ransom, they have no guarantee that the attacker will free their device or data.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Phishing attacks often lead to financial headaches, sometimes large ones at that. It depends on the information scammers get their hands on. In some cases, the damage might lead to identity fraud and a few illicit charges on a debit or credit card. If scammers gather enough information, they can take that a step further and commit identity theft. That can include opening new credit or loans in your name. It could also give a scammer the info they need to get driver’s licenses or employment in your name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Above and beyond committing fraud or theft on their own, scammers might also sell stolen information to others on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Again, all not-so-good. Yet quite preventable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to tell if a website is safe or unsafe.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For some sites, it only takes one sign. For other sites, it takes a few signs—a series of red flags that warn you a site is unsafe. When you’re online, keep a sharp eye out for the following:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site uses HTTP rather than HTTPS.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The “s” stands for “secure.” Specifically, it means that the website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser. SSL helps prevent others from intercepting and reading your sensitive information as it’s transmitted, which is particularly important when you shop or bank online. Likewise, you can also look for a little lock symbol in the address bar of your web browser. That’s one more way you can spot a site that uses SSL.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site has a combination of typos and poor design.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">From spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, to stretched out logos and cheap photography, some unsafe websites are designed poorly. Legitimate businesses pride themselves on error-free and professional-looking sites. If a website looks like it got cobbled together in a hurry or doesn’t seem to be well-designed, that’s usually a red flag. The site might be unsafe, created by attackers who don’t have a strong attention to detail—or the creative capabilities to create a good-looking website in the first place.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The web address looks altered or off.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Plenty of unsafe sites are imposter sites. They’ll try to pass themselves off as a legitimate company, like the streaming services, banks, and so forth that we mentioned earlier—all to get a hold of your account information. With all these imposter sites in play, look at the site’s address. Scammers will gin up web addresses that are close to but different from legitimate sites, so close that you might miss it. If you’re uncertain about the address, leave the page. Also note that many companies have web pages that provide lists of the official addresses that they use. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com.mcas.ms%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%3FnodeId%3DG4YFYCCNUSENA23B%26McasTsid%3D20892%23%3A~%3Atext%3DNote%253A%2520Legitimate%2520Amazon%2520websites%2520have%2C789.123%252Famazon.com%252F.&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Amazon</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> provides on example, and we do the same here at </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fcyber-scam%2Fcustomer-scam-awareness.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

So much so, it’s often the subject of sitcom bits. Needless to say, the attackers behind these sites want you to click for one of several reasons. It might be to get you to download malware. It might be to generate ad revenue with clicks. Or it might be to get you to click a link that redirects you to another malicious site. In all, if you encounter a site like this, close your browser. And then run a system scan with your online protection software.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site offers hard-to-get items at an outrageous discount.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These unsafe sites sprout up around </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the holidays</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and gift-giving seasons. When stores run low on particularly popular or hot items, scammers will quickly launch sites that claim these items are in stock and ready to ship. Similarly, they might promote popular items at a deep discount. Of course, shopping at these sites will likely lead to one thing—a credit card charge and no item on your doorstep. Be wary when you see ads for stores in your social media feed, in search, and elsewhere. Stick with known, trusted retailers.

When popular movies hit the big screen or major sporting events come around, so do scam sites that promise to stream them for free or at </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a low</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> cost. Avoid them. T</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">rusted streamers will only carry shows and events that they have the rights to. If you find an offer to stream something that’s heavily discounted, free, or not available on known media outlets, it’s likely a scam. At the very least, it might serve up pirated content, which could carry malware threats along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The site promotes prizes, coupons, or a quiz.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not every site that promotes some kind of giveaway or deal is a scam. Yet the ones that ask for personal or financial information likely are. Scammers prey on people’s love for saving money or even winning a buck or two. Enter the prize, coupon, and quiz sites. Malicious prize and coupon sites will often ask for credit or debit card information, often under the guise of a payout or a discount. Malicious quiz sites will likewise ask for all kinds of personal information, typically questions about the name of your pet, the first car you owned, or where you went to school. The questions share much in common with the security questions used by banks and credit card companies. Handing this information over could lead to a breached account. Give these sites a pass.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be extra confident—let online protection determine if that site is safe for you.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=b6928ee9d9a54a4ce95fa03a5e8cc3311a3d0f56dc5d94994f9113bae2a5a1fc\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive online protection software like ours</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes web protection that can spot malicious sites for you.

To live in a time where we can access this amazing technology from the smartphones in our pockets is a privilege; however, overusing AI or using it irresponsibly could cause a chain reaction that not only affects you but your close circle and society beyond.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Here are four tips to help you navigate and use AI responsibly.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1. Always Double Check AI’s Work</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Artificial intelligence certainly earns the “intelligence” part of its name, but that doesn’t mean it never makes mistakes. Make sure to proofread or review everything AI creates, be it written, visual, or audio content. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For instance, if you’re seeking a realistic image or video, AI often adds extra fingers and distorts faces. Some of its creations can be downright nightmarish! Also, there’s a phenomenon known as an AI hallucination. This occurs when the AI doesn’t admit that it doesn’t know the answer to your question. Instead, it makes up information that is untrue and even fabricates fake sources to back up its claims.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">One AI hallucination landed a lawyer in big trouble in New York. The lawyer used ChatGPT to write a brief, but he didn’t double check the AI’s work. It turns out the majority of the brief was incorrect.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Whether you’re a blogger with thousands of readers or you ask AI to write a little blurb to share amongst your friends or coworkers, it is imperative to edit everything that an AI tool generates. Not doing so could start a rumor based on a completely false claim.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Be Transparent</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you use AI to do more than gather a few rough ideas, you should cite the tool you used as a source. Passing off an AI’s work as your own could be considered cheating in the eyes of teachers, bosses, or critics. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There’s a lot of debate about whether AI has a place in the art world. One artist entered an image to a photography contest that he secretly created with AI. When his submission won the contest, the photographer revealed AI’s role in the image and gave up his prize. The photographer intentionally kept AI out of the conversation to prove a point, but imagine if he kept the image’s origin to himself.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Would that be fair?

Moreover, trusted streamers will only carry shows and events that they have the rights to. If you find an offer to stream something that’s heavily discounted, free, or not available on known media outlets, it’s likely a scam.

They use a phone’s permission settings to spy on its user by accessing the phone’s camera, microphone, and more.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">At the heart of any smartphone app you’ll find permissions, which allow apps to use certain features of your phone. A messaging app might ask for access to your camera and microphone to send video and voice messages. It might ask for permission to access your photos if you want to send pictures. Likewise, a navigation or rideshare app will ask for permission to access your phone’s location services.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">In short, permissions make apps work. And broadly speaking, most apps out there are legitimate. Yet what about a game that asks for permissions to access your contact list? Or a flashlight app that wants to use your microphone? How about a run-of-the-mill wallpaper app that wants to know your location? These are all examples of invasive apps. And the creators behind them want your personal information and to invade your privacy as well.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Luckily, invasive apps are easy to spot. And remove.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Invasive apps and mobile spyware</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Both invasive apps and mobile spyware snoop on you and your phone, yet invasive apps work differently than <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fmobile-spyware-how-you-can-keep-stalkers-off-your-phone%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fmobile-spyware-how-you-can-keep-stalkers-off-your-phone%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">mobile spyware</a>. Invasive apps use a phone’s built-in functionality to spy and gather information on you. Spyware is malware that can maliciously steal information by working secretly in the background. This can make an invasive app much easier to spot because it asks for broad permissions—permissions it doesn’t need to work.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Invasive apps might ask for permission to:</div>\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\" data-border=\"0\">\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Use your camera.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Access your microphone.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Track your location.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Access and modify your contacts.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Read your calendar.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Requests for permissions such as these aren’t a sign of an invasive app in and of themselves. Some apps require them to work. The telltale sign of an invasive app is when the app asks for permissions it doesn’t need. Think like the flashlight app that wants access to your microphone.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">The tricky bit with invasive apps is that many people quickly click through the user agreements and permission screens when they get a new app. Sometimes without reading carefully. That can particularly be the case with children grabbing a new app.<br />\nHowever, it’s never too late to spot an invasive app. And remove it.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Understanding, and controlling, permissions on your phone</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">With a quick trip to your phone’s settings, you can spot and remove invasive apps.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">On an iOS device …</b></div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, then tap Safety Check.<br />\nHere you can see which apps use the permissions you granted them and make changes to those permissions as needed.You can also run an App Privacy Report, which records data and sensor access on an app-by-app level. Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, then tap App Privacy Report. You can adjust your permissions from there as well.</div>\n<h3 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">On an Android device …</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">On your device, open the Settings app.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Tap <b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Apps</b>. Tap the app you want to change. If you can&#8217;t find it, tap See all apps. Then, select your app. Tap <b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Permissions</b>. If you allowed or denied any permissions for the app, you’ll find them here. To change the permission setting, tap it, then select Allow or Don&#8217;t allow.<br />\nFor location, camera, and microphone permissions, you might be able to select:</div>\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\" data-border=\"0\">\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">All the time: For location only. The app can use the permission at any time, even when you’re not using the app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Allow only while using the app: The app can use the permission only when you&#8217;re using that app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Ask every time: Every time you open the app, it&#8217;ll ask to use the permission. It can use the permission until you’re done with the app.</li>\n<li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\">Don&#8217;t allow: The app can&#8217;t use the permission, even when you’re using the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Invasive app? You might just want to delete it.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Rather than pare back permissions on an invasive app, your best and safest bet is to delete the app altogether. Even with excessive permissions turned off, the app might collect other information and send it to the company who developed it. Further, they might share it with others. In short, an invasive app is a bad app all around. Get rid of it and go with something legitimate.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">More ways to keep invasive apps off your phone</b></h2>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">1. Update your phone’s operating system.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Along with installing security software, keeping your phone’s operating system up to date can greatly improve your security. Updates can fix vulnerabilities that hackers rely on to pull off their malware-based attacks. It’s another tried-and-true method of keeping yourself safe—and for keeping your phone running great too.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">2. Avoid third-party app stores.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Google Play and Apple’s App Store have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure. Third-party sites might very well not, and they might intentionally host malicious apps as part of a front. Further, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps from their stores when discovered, making shopping there safer still.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">3. Review apps carefully.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Check out the developer—have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps might have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They might be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.</div>\n<h4><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">4. Go with a strong recommendation.</b></h4>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Yet better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors themselves. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download.</div>\n<h3><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">5. Protect your phone.</b></h3>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=fb4fe893af74a2dad63f1cdc77de7f3e6b1ab33d2f08e3b2bae5ee0aa218382d\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Comprehensive online protection software</a> can secure your phone in the same ways that it secures your laptops and computers. Installing it can protect your privacy, keep you safe from attacks on public Wi-Fi, and automatically block unsafe websites and links, just to name a few things it can do.</div>\n<h2 class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Be stingy with your apps and their permissions</b></h2>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Permissions make for powerful apps that can help you hail a ride, get a pizza delivered to your door, and map your afternoon run. In the wrong hands, they can also snoop on your activities. If an app ever feels like it’s asking for too many permissions to do its job, you might have an invasive app on your hands.<br />\nYet the trick is that some invasive apps still slip through and end up on our phones. Quickly accepting terms and permissions is one reason. For extra protection, consider running a quick app audit. Check the apps and permissions on your phone as noted above and delete any suspicious apps.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">Be stingy when it comes to giving your permission. Roll back the permissions so that the app works with the bare minimum of permissions. Set location services so that they’re only used when the app is in use. With social and messaging apps, select which photos you allow them to share rather than giving the app blanket access to your entire photo library.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">And lastly, if an app seems like it’s asking for too much, it probably is. Avoid it altogether.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/mobile-spyware/\">Mobile Spyware: How Hackers Can Turn Your Phone Into a Stalking Machine</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"10 Tips to Keep Your Data Private Online","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/10-tips-to-keep-your-data-private-online/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Sat, 15 Jul 2023 13:30:03 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Tips & Tricks"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"identity theft"},{"#cdata-section":"mobile security"},{"#cdata-section":"data protection"},{"#cdata-section":"internet security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"http://blogs.mcafee.com/?p=32276"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>The moment you hop online, you lose a little privacy.  How much depends on what you’re doing and what steps...</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/10-tips-to-keep-your-data-private-online/\">10 Tips to Keep Your Data Private Online</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300x200_Blog_071423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The moment you hop online, you lose a little privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">How much depends on what you’re doing and what steps you’ve put in place to protect your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The reality is that any online activity will generate data.

Yet similar data collection happens far more broadly online. Internet service providers (ISPs) will often gather browsing data and information about their users. Some search engines will also gather information about their users, their searches, and where those searches take them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another high-value form of data collection entails location tracking. App creators, ISPs, cell phone companies, and others will pair what you’re doing online with where and when you’re doing it. Together, all that data can paint a rather exacting portrait of you and your daily travels. It’s behavioral data, like when and where you go to work, when and where you shop, and perhaps where you like to go for your 5k runs or 20k bike rides. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Make no mistake that all this data has value.

Put another way, keeping your profile public makes it searchable by search engines.

Think of it as a sort of private browsing where a “tunneled” connection shields you from prying eyes, which can minimize the data that gets exposed as it transmits to and from your device. In some cases, a VPN can also shield the information advertisers and ISPs might wish to otherwise collect. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">7) Clean up your personal data trail</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When was the last time you Googled yourself?

Who’s collecting and posting this information about you? Online data brokers, which gather information from all manner of public records. Beyond that, they’ll also gather information from app developers, loyalty cards, and from other companies that track your web browsing. Data brokers will sell this info to anyone. Advertisers, background checkers, telemarketers, and scammers too. Data brokers don’t discriminate.

Shadily, these quizzes might ask for the name of the street you grew up on, your birthdate, your favorite song, and maybe the name of a beloved first pet. Of course, these are pieces of personal information, sometimes the answer to commonly used security questions by banks and other financial institutions. (Like, what was the model of your first car?) With this info in hand, a hacker could </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">try</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to gain access to your accounts. Needless to say, skip the quizzes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">9) Update, update, update </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When and where possible, set all your operating systems and apps for automatic updates.

Be aware of your surroundings in the coffee shop. Secure your smartphone from pickpockets. Bring your laptop in the car when you quickly pop into the store.

Yet in our case here, oversharing means saying more than one should to more people than they should. Consider the audience you have across your social media profiles. Perhaps you have dozens, if not hundreds of friends and followers. All with various degrees of closeness and familiarity. Who among them can you absolutely trust with the information you share?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And you might be sharing more than you think. Posts have a way of saying more than one thing, like:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">“This is the pool at the rental home I’m staying at this week. Amazing!” </span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Which also tells everyone, </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">“My home is empty for the next few days.”</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">“I can’t start my workday without a visit to my favorite coffeeshop.” </span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Which also says, </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">“If you ever want to track me down in person, you can find me at this location practically any weekday morning.”</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">One can quickly point to other examples of oversharing. Unintentional oversharing at that.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">A first-day-of-school picture can tell practical strangers which elementary school your children attend, say if the picture includes the school’s reader board in it. A snapshot of you joking around with a co-worker might reveal a glimpse of company information. Maybe because of what’s written on the whiteboard behind the two of you. And in one extreme example, there’s the case an assault on a pop star. Her attacker tracked her down through her selfie, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com.mcas.ms%2Fworld%2F2019%2Foct%2F11%2Fjapanese-assault-suspect-tracked-down-pop-star-via-eye-reflection-in-selfie%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=be03fb89806501661e60922e33c3ef6d9a0e340d22e20b79bd6a272210bb403e\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">determining her location through the reflection in her eyes</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The list goes on. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s not to say “don’t post.” More accurately, it’s “consider what you’re posting and who gets to see it.” You have control over what you post, and to some degree, who gets to see those posts. That combination is key to your privacy—and the privacy of others too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Three simple steps for protecting your privacy on social media</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) Be more selective with your settings</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting—not to mention your relationships and likes. Taking a “friends only” approach to your social media profiles can help protect your privacy, because </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">that gives</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> a possible scammer or stalker much less material to work with. Yet further, some platforms allow you to create sub-groups of friends and followers. With a quick review of your network, you can create a sub-group of your most trusted friends and restrict your posts to them as needed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be critical of the invitations you receive.

Also consider if your post pinpoints where you are or where you go regularly. Do you want people in your broader network to know that? Closely review the pics you take and see if there’s any revealing information in the background. If so, you can crop it out (think notes on a whiteboard, reflections in a window, or revealing location info). Further, ask anyone you want to include in their post for their permission.

Gen AI can soak up huge amounts of data. For instance, ChatGPT is trained on 300 billion words and hundreds of megabytes’ worth of facts through the year 2021.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The AI will remember every piece of information that is fed into it.

This means that the AI will try to outdo itself to produce an answer it believes is the most accurate. The more information and queries it answers, the “smarter” the AI becomes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Google’s content generation tool, Bard is a great way to illustrate generative AI in action. Bard is based on gen AI and large language models. It&#8217;s trained in all types of literature and when asked to write a short story, it does so by finding language patterns and composing by choosing words that most often follow the one preceding it. In a 60 Minutes segment, Bard composed an eloquent short story that nearly brought the presenter to tears, but its composition was an exercise in patterns, not a display of understanding human emotions.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">3</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> So, while the technology is certainly smart, it’s not exactly creative.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to Use Generative AI Responsibly</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The major debates surrounding generative AI usually deal with how to use gen AI-powered tools for good.

Her teenager had convinced her to join a dating site, so she created a profile on a popular app. After a handful of dates fell flat, she found Scott (name also changed). He was charismatic, kind. “We had an instant connection,” according to Sarah. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They spent hours on the phone sharing their deepest secrets and even started imagining a future together. But after about three months, Scott fell on hard times. At first, he needed to borrow $400 to pay for airfare to visit a dying relative, which he paid back immediately. Over the next few months, the numbers grew to $1,000 for rent and $3,000 for a business venture. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Repayments for those loans never came, and before long, Sarah had loaned her new love over $8,500. When she pressed him for the money, Scott ghosted Sarah online, moved out of town, and she never saw him again. She didn’t share her story with many people. She didn’t report it. She was too embarrassed and humiliated and even became depressed following what she calls “the Scott scam.” Painfully, she lost her trust in others.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sarah isn’t alone.

Reported losses hit $1.3 billion with a median loss of $4,400. And with such statistics, those figures reflect only what was reported.

They might begin on dating apps and sites, just like in Sarah’s case. Yet they can happen elsewhere and even pop out of the blue too. Scammers will prowl around </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">on</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> social media, texts, and online games by pinging potential victims with an unexpected introductory message—a sort of digital opening line. In fact, the FTC reports that 40% of online dating and romance scams began with a message on social media, versus only 19% on dating apps.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With the initial connection made, a chat begins, and a friendship (or more) blossoms from there. Along the way, the scammer will often rely on a mix of somewhat exotic yet believable storytelling to lure the victim in. Often, that will involve their job and where they’re working. Reports say that scammers will talk of being workers on an offshore oil rig, members of the military stationed overseas, doctors working with an international organization, or working in the sort of jobs that would prevent them from otherwise easily meeting up in person. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With the phony relationship established, the scammer starts asking for money. The FTC reports that they’ll ask for money for several bogus reasons, usually revolving around some sort of hardship where they need a “little help” so that they can pay: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For a plane ticket or other travel expenses. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For medical expenses. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Customs fees to retrieve something. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gambling debts. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A visa or other official travel documents. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The list goes on, yet that’s the general gist.

The benefit of this route, for the scammer anyway, is that this is as good as forking over cash. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. The victim lacks the protections they have with other payment forms, such as a credit card that allows the holder to cancel or contest a charge. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way is through gift cards. Scammers of all stripes, not </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> romance scammers, like these because they effectively work like cash, whether it’s a gift card for a major online retailer or a chain of brick-and-mortar stores.

AI has existed in many forms for decades, but it’s only recently that AI-powered apps and tools are available in the pockets and homes of just about everyone.

And are they playing video games together? Comic impersonators can be hilariously accurate with their copycatting, but the voice track to this video is spot on. This series of videos, created by TikToker Voretecks, uses AI voice generation to mimic presidential voices and pit them against each other to bring joy to their viewers.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> In this case, AI-generated voices are mostly harmless, since the videos are in jest. Context clues make it obvious that the presidents didn’t gather to hunt rogue machines together.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI voice generation turns nefarious when it’s meant to trick people into thinking or acting a certain way. For example, an AI voiceover made it look like a candidate for Chicago mayor said something inflammatory that he never said.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Fake news is likely to skyrocket with the fierce 2024 election on the horizon. Social media sites, especially Twitter, are an effective avenue for political saboteurs to spread their lies far and wide to discredit their opponent.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, while it might not appear on your social media feed, scammers can use what you post on social media to impersonate your voice.

A responsible social media user will alert their audiences when the content they post is AI generated. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Again, deepfake and other AI-altered images become malicious when they cause social media viewers to think or act a certain way. Fake news outlets may portray a political candidate doing something embarrassing to sway voters. Or an AI-altered image of animals in need may tug at the heartstrings of social media users and cause them to donate to a fake fundraiser.

Vishing is another phishing tactic over the phone, though instead of a text, the scammer leaves voicemails.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the case of one coordinated smishing attack, cybercriminals not only impersonated financial institutions but collected PII on their targets ahead of time. The criminals then used these personal details – like old addresses and Social Security Numbers – to convince people that they were legitimate bank employees.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">1</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> But since when does a bank try to prove itself to the customer? Usually, it’s the other way around, where they’ll ask you to confirm your identity. Be wary of anyone who texts or calls you and has your PII. If you’re ever suspicious of a caller or texter claiming they’re a financial official, contact your bank through verified channels (chat, email, or phone) you find on the bank’s website to make sure. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers also keep up with current events and attempt to impersonate well-known companies that have a reason to reach out to their customers. This adds false legitimacy to their message. For example, in the summer of 2022, Rogers Communications, a Canadian telecommunications provider, experienced an extended loss of service and told customers they could expect a reimbursement. Smishers jumped on the opportunity and sent a barrage of fake texts requesting banking details in order to carry out the reimbursement.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> However, Rogers credited customers directly to their Rogers accounts.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3 Tips to Identify a Smisher </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you receive a suspicious text, go through these three steps to determine if you should follow up with the organization in question or simply delete and report the text.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1.

If not, disregard any text claiming to be from those organizations. Companies will only contact you through the channels you have approved.

However, the tone is a good indicator of a scammer. If the tone of the text urges you to act quickly or proposes a dire consequence of ignoring the message, be on alert. While suspicious activity on your credit card is serious, your bank will likely reimburse you for charges you didn’t make, so you have time to check your bank account and see recent activities. Official correspondence from financial institutions will always be professional and will try to put you at ease, not make you panic.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Verify the phone number</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Whenever you get a text from someone you don’t know, it’s a good practice to do an internet search for the number to see with whom it’s associated.

Never click on any links in the message, as they can redirect you to risky sites or download malware to your device. Also, don’t reply to the text.

For example, they give fiduciaries (like an estate executor, trustee, or an agent under a power of attorney) the right to manage a person’s digital assets if they already have the right to manage a person’s tangible assets. Such laws continue to evolve, and they can vary from state to state here in the U.S.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With that in mind, nothing offered in this article is legal advice, nor should it be construed as such.

As mentioned above, some accounts you hold are licensed to you and you alone. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they will not transfer. Two of the biggest examples are social media and email accounts. This can have serious repercussions if you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">don&#8217;t</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> leave specific instructions as to how those accounts should be handled after your passing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, do you want your social media profiles to remain online as a memorial or do you want them simply shut down? Note that different social media platforms have different policies for handling the accounts of users who have passed away. For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com.mcas.ms%2Fhelp%2F1017717331640041%2Fabout-memorialized-accounts%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Facebook allows for creating memorialized accounts that allow friends and families to continue sharing memories</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Policies vary, so check with your social media platforms of choice for specifics.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, will your executor need access to your email account to handle the estate’s affairs? And what about access to online accounts for paying bills and then ultimately closing those accounts? In all, these are points of discussion to have with an experienced estate attorney who knows the law in your region.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other things to be aware of are that subscriptions to streaming accounts are likely non-transferrable as well. Often, eBooks and digital publications you own are only licensed to you as the sole owner and can’t be transferred. Check the agreements </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">linked</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with items like these and have a talk with your attorney about them to determine what can and can’t be done with them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Blogs and online communities</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another aspect of your digital legacy is your voice. If you’re a blogger or a participant in an online community, you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> wish for a fiduciary or family member to leave a farewell post. Additionally, in the case of a blog, you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> want to set up some means for your work to stay online or get archived in some manner. Again, you can work with your attorney to leave specific instructions.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Giving your executor access to your digital assets</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can’t pass assets along if an executor can’t get access to them. A real-life example shows why digital executorship is so vital. Consider the story of the woman who lost family photos after her husband passed away. He kept them in an online storage account to which she had no access. And sadly, the company wouldn’t grant her access after his passing. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is often the case with many online accounts and services. Legally speaking, the deceased might own the storage account and the media kept within it, yet the cloud storage company owns the servers on which that media is stored. Access by someone other than the deceased might constitute a breach of their privacy policy or user agreements.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One way you can avoid heartbreak like this is to discuss giving your executor access to your accounts. You can consider creating a list of accounts, usernames, and passwords in a sealed letter </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">with</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> instructions that outline your wishes. A sealed letter is important: a will is </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a public</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> record after you pass away. A separate, sealed letter is not, which makes it a safe place to pass along account information. Again, you can discuss an option such as this with your attorney.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Protecting your digital assets</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One thing you can do today that can protect your digital assets for the long haul is to use </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">comprehensive security protection</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

It’s the foundational technology that underpins cryptocurrency and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), yet it has several other emerging applications as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In all, gaining a sense of how blockchain technology works will give you a further sense as to how it may eventually shape the way you go about your day.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Blockchain technology holds great potential because of the unique, decentralized way it handles data—which marks the first step in understanding how it works.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How blockchains work</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">An easy way to visualize how a blockchain works is with an old-fashioned ledger. Each ledger entry is a link in a “chain.” Within each chain is a unique identifier known as a hash and a block of data associated with it. Over time, chains get added, which updates the hash as new blocks of data are added to the chain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">A simplified example of a blockchain storing recipe instructions.

Dozens, hundreds, thousands, or more participants in the blockchain track and validate the transactions associated with it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Each blockchain</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> entry gets validated through consensus, where individual participants on a blockchain network must all “agree” that the data in each entry is correct. Participants in the blockchain network can arrive at consensus through several models, yet commonly they use cryptographic calculations to validate an update to the chain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In this way, blockchain technology removes the need for a central authority to oversee a transaction, such as a bank. Put </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">simply</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, blockchain gets rid of the </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">go-between</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. And it makes transactions more anonymous as a result.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Participants in a blockchain network receive a small amount of cryptocurrency per transaction as a reward for their efforts. Enter the notion of crypto mining, where some miners set up large-scale farms of powerful, specialized computers that participate in blockchain networks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Blockchains come in public and private forms. Public is just as it sounds, where anyone can participate in the blockchain. They can read, write, or validate data in the blockchain. Private blockchains are invite-only in nature and can establish rules about who can alter the blockchain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Many blockchain ledger entries record financial transactions associated with cryptocurrency. However, ledger entries can contain any type of data. One can just as easily store documents, images, log files, or other items in a blockchain. Even decentralized programs, also known as smart contracts, can be stored. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In all, there’s much more to blockchain technology than just cryptocurrency.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How are blockchains used?

The link might include unusual strings of characters and a web address that doesn’t match who the message says it’s coming from. Like a bogus notice from the post office that doesn’t use the official post office URL. Or, the link might look </span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">almost</span></i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> like a legitimate address, but changes the name in a way that indicates it’s bogus. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another indicator might be that you don’t know “Mandy” at all.

They will attack several smaller businesses for smaller dollar amounts, which can rival the funds they’d reap by attacking one large target for one large amount—and with less relative risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another factor that makes these businesses so attractive to cybercriminals is that one hack can lead to another. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Case in point, you might recall the massive data breach at Target during the holiday shopping season in 2013.

By hacking a local HVAC contractor that used Target’s systems for billing, contracts, and project management. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This shows how a breach in even the smallest of links in the supply chain can lead to yet another breach that impacts millions of people. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As always, hackers look for easy, low-risk targets that offer the highest reward. In the case of businesses that make $500,000 a year or less, they’ve found exactly that.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Two roadblocks to a more secure business: time and remote workers.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Even as cybercriminals increase their attacks, both time and remote work only increase the risk to businesses. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Time is an issue business owners know well already. There&#8217;s never enough of it, which means some aspects of the business get prioritized over others. In this mix, cybersecurity suffers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our own research in the U.S. and Europe found that </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">63% of small business owners spend an hour or less on protecting their business a week. Moreover, 45% manage security in an ad-hoc way. It’s understandable, given that business owners would rather invest time in growing their business rather than managing their security. However, this low prioritization puts the business at risk, which could result in those six-figure losses mentioned above.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The advent of remote work introduces further security issues as well.

Whether working from home or some other location like a café, these employees may not have proper cybersecurity protection in place. Further, they may be using unsecure networks or Wi-Fi that can put company data at risk—not to mention their data as well. In all, remote workers can find themselves quite vulnerable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protection from breaches and attacks with security that’s built for your business.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:180,&quot;335559740&quot;:221}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As we created McAfee Small Business protection, we kept these issues in mind.

Beyond the dollars involved, the costs can run yet deeper from there. Downtime in the wake of an attack hits the bottom line. The recovery efforts that follow do as well. Additionally, businesses can suffer reputational damage if an attack also affects its customers, clients, and partners. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, a shift has taken place. Cybercriminals still go after big businesses and major organizations, yet an increasing number of them go after businesses with revenues in the seven or even six figures. Poor security posture is one reason. Another is that even relatively amateur operations can wage attacks with “off-the-shelf” hacking tools found on the dark web. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In short, every business faces the risk of cybercrime today.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet with the right protection in place, you can avoid paying the price of cybercrime.

For example, if you’re traveling by yourself, it may be a good idea to share the location of your smartphone with an emergency contact. That way, if circumstances cause you to deviate from your itinerary, your designated loved one can reach out and ensure your personal safety.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The key to sharing your location safely is to only allow your most trusted loved one to track the whereabouts of you and your connected device. Once you’re back on known territory, you may want to consider turning off all location services, since it presents a few security and privacy risks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Risks of Location Sharing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In just about every other case, you should definitely think twice about enabling location sharing on your smartphone. Here are three risks it poses to your online privacy and possibly your real-life personal safety:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

The scammer will send a text or email that looks like it comes from someone you know.

In many of these cases, scammers will quickly ask for money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another classic is the tax scam, where a scammer poses as a tax agent or representative. From there, they bully money out of their victims with threats of legal action or even arrest. Dealing with an actual tax issue might be uncomfortable, but a legitimate tax agent won’t threaten you like that.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2) You get an incredible offer.

What they say and how they say it seems off or out of character. It might include links or attachments you didn’t expect to get.

Clean up your personal data online.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online data brokers hoard all kinds of personal information about individuals. And they’ll sell it to anyone. That includes scammers. Data brokers gather it from multiple sources, such as public records and third parties that have further information like browsing histories and shopping histories (think your supermarket club card). With that information, a scammer can sound quite convincing—like they know you in some way or where your interests lie. You can get this information removed so scammers can’t get their hands on it.

It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and with select products, it can even manage the removal for you. ​</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">2. Set your social media accounts to private.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Needless to say, social media says a lot about you and what you’re into. You already know that because you put a part of yourself out there with each post—not to mention a record of the groups, pages, and things that you follow or like. All this provides yet more grist for a scammer’s mill when it comes time for them to concoct their stories. Setting your accounts to private takes your posts out of the public eye, and the eye of potential scammers too. This can help reduce your risk of getting conned.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">3. Confirm before you click. Better yet, type in addresses yourself.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers throw all kinds of bogus links at people in the hope they’ll click and wind up on their scammy websites. They’ll also send attachments loaded with malware—a payload that contains ransomware, spyware, or viruses. If you get a message about one of your accounts, a shipment, or anything that involves your personal or financial info, confirm the sender. Did the message come from a legitimate address or account? Or was the address spoofed or the account a fake? For example, some scammers create social media accounts to pose as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS doesn&#8217;t contact people through social media. If you have a concern about a message or account, visit the site in question by typing it in directly instead of clicking on the link in the message. Access your information from there or call their customer service line.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">4. Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The combination of these two things makes it tough for scammers to crack your accounts. Even if they somehow get hold of your password, they can’t get into your account without the multifactor authentication number (usually sent to your phone in some form). </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">A password manager as part of comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> can help you create and securely store those strong, unique passwords. Also, never give your authentication number to anyone after you receive it. Another common scammer trick is to masquerade as a customer service rep and ask you to send that number to them.</span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">5. Slow down. View messages skeptically.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This is the one piece of advice scammers don’t want you to have, let alone follow. They count on you getting caught up in the moment—the emotion of it all. Once again, emotions, urgency, and human nature are all key components in any social engineering con. The moment you stop and think about the message, what it’s asking of you, and the way it’s asking you for it, will often quickly let you know that something is not quite right. Follow up. A quick phone call or face-to-face chat can help you from getting conned.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/social-engineering-the-scammers-secret-weapon/\">Social Engineering—The Scammer’s Secret Weapon</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Dangers of Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 11:44:17 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"artificial intelligence"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"dangers of AI"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=170872"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/300x200_Blog_061623-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Over the decades, Hollywood has depicted artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple unsettling ways.

It’s constantly learning and forming new patterns. The more questions you ask it, the more data it collects and the “smarter” it gets. However, when you ask ChatGPT a question it doesn’t know the answer to, it doesn’t admit that it doesn’t know. Instead, it’ll make up an answer like a precocious schoolchild.

A lawyer presented a lengthy brief that cited multiple law cases to back his point. It turns out the lawyer used ChatGPT to write the entire brief and he didn’t fact check the AI’s work.

Researchers and writers have a duty to thoroughly doublecheck any work they outsource to text generation tools like ChatGPT. When a trustworthy online source publishes content and asserts it as the unbiased truth, readers should be able to trust that the publisher isn’t leading them astray.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

In fact, scientists and engineers have been using it for decades to accelerate new materials and medical discoveries. For example, generative AI is central to inventing carbon capture materials that will be key to slowing the effects of global warming.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Online tools fueled by generative AI can save you time too. For instance, AI can likely handle run-of-the-mill emails that you hardly have time to write between all your meetings.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cons of AI in Daily Life</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Dwindling authenticity</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What happens to genuine human connections as AI expands? The Modern Love Report discovered 49% of people would feel hurt if their partner used AI to write a love note. What they thought was written with true feeling was composed by a heartless computer program. ChatGPT composes its responses based on what’s published elsewhere on the internet. So, not only are its responses devoid of real human emotion, but the “emotion” it does portray is plagiarized. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Additionally, some artists perceive AI-generated components within digital artworks as cheapening the talent of human artists. The same with AI-written content is consistent with AI art: None of the art it generates is original. It takes inspiration and snippets from already-published images and mashes them together. The results can be visually striking (or nightmarish), but some argue that it belittles the human spirit.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI hallucinations are also a problem in the authenticity and accuracy of AI-generated content. An AI hallucination occurs when the generative AI program doesn’t know the answer to a prompt. Instead of diligently researching the correct answer, the AI makes up the answer. This can lead to the proliferation of fake news or inaccurate reporting.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Faster and more believable online scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI-generated content is expanding the repertoire and speed of online scammers.

Now with ChatGPT, phishing emails are much more polished, since, at the sentence level, it writes smoothly and correctly. This makes it more difficult for even the most diligent readers to identify and avoid phishing attempts. Also, instead of spending time imagining and writing their fake backstories, phishers can offload that task to ChatGPT, which makes quick work of it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercriminals are working out the possibilities of leveraging ChatGPT to write new types of malware quickly. In four hours, one researcher gave ChatGPT minimal instructions and it wrote an undetectable malware program.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> This means that someone with little to no coding experience could theoretically create a powerful new strain of malicious software. The speed at which the researcher created the malware is also noteworthy. A cybercriminal could trial-and-error dozens of malware programs.

The more outdated your apps or operating system is, the more time criminals have had to work out ways to infiltrate them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Enabling automatic updates on all your devices only takes a few clicks or taps.

What also makes for an excellent password is one that’s unique. Reusing passwords can be just as risky as using “password123” or your pet’s name plus your birthday as a password. A reused password can put all your online accounts at risk, due to a practice called credential stuffing. Credential stuffing is a tactic where a cybercriminal attempts to input a stolen username and password combination in dozens of random websites to see which doors it opens. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remembering a different password for each of your online accounts is almost an impossible task.

Then await further action communicated through official company correspondences and official channels.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercriminals aren’t above adding insult to injury and further scamming customers affected in breaches. Phishers may spam inboxes impersonating the company and sending malware-laden links they claim will reset your password. Continue to scrutinize your messages and keep an eye on the company’s official company website and verified social media accounts to ensure you&#8217;re getting company-approved advice. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7. Secure Every Home Device</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One great mantra to guide your cybersecurity habits is: If you connect it, protect it. This means that any device that links to the internet should have security measures in place to shield it from cybercriminals. Yes, this includes your smart TV, smart refrigerator, smart thermostat, and smart lightbulbs! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Compose a list of the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fprivacy-identity-protection%2Fmake-your-smart-home-a-secure-home-too-securing-your-iot-smart-home-devices%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">smart home devices</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you own. (You probably have more than you thought!) Then, make sure that every device is using a password you created, instead of the default password the device came with. Default passwords can be reused across an entire line of appliances. So, if a cybercriminal cracks the code on someone else’s smart washing machine, that could mean they could weasel their way into yours with the same password.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way to secure your connected home devices is by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This usually means enrolling your phone number or email address with the device and inputting one-time codes periodically to log into the connected device. 2FA is an excellent way to frustrate a cybercriminal, as it’s extremely difficult for them to bypass this security measure. It may add an extra 15 seconds to your login process, but the peace of mind is worth the minor inconvenience.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, encase your entire home network with a secure router, or the device that connects your home Wi-Fi network to the internet. Again, change the password from the factory setting. And if you decide to rename the network, have fun with it but leave your name and address out of the new name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">8. Lock Your Devices</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When flip phones arrived on the scene in the 1990s and early 2000s, the worst that happened when they went missing was that you lost a cache of your stored text messages and call history. Now, when you </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmobile-security%2Fwhere-did-i-leave-my-phone-protecting-your-phone-from-loss-and-theft%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">misplace or have your smartphone stolen</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, it can seem like your whole online life vanished. Mobile devices store a lot of our sensitive information, so that’s why it’s key to not only safeguard your accounts but the devices that house them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The best way to lock your device against anyone but yourself is to set up face or fingerprint ID. This makes it virtually impossible for a criminal to open your device. Also, passcode- or password-protect all your devices. It may seem like an inconvenience now, but your fingers will soon be able to glide across the keyboard or number pad fluently in just a few days, adding maybe an extra second to opening your device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another way to safeguard your device and the important information within it is to disable your favorite internet browser from auto-filling your passwords and credit card information. In the hands of a criminal, these details could lead to significant losses. A password manager here comes in handy for quick and secure password and username inputting. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">9. Check Your Credit Regularly</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Credit experts recommend checking your credit at least once yearly, but there’s no harm in checking your credit score more often. It’s only hard inquiries (or credit checks initiated by lenders) that may lower your credit score. Consider making it a habit to check your credit once every quarter. The first signs of identity theft often appear in a drastically lower credit score, which means that someone may be opening lines of credit in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Also, if you’re not planning to apply for a new credit card or a loan anytime soon, why not lock your credit so no one can access it?

has become both a more regular and widely accepted part of our daily lives. But that doesn’t mean that we can take our eye off the ball. While there is a lot to love about gaming, there are still steps we should all take to ensure the experience is safe and positive for everyone, particularly our kids. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Yes, I’m talking about passwords again!! And here’s why – if you (or your kids) use the same password for each of your online accounts and one of those accounts get hacked, then you risk losing control of your entire digital life. Yes, I know it sounds dramatic but that is the reality. The easiest way of avoiding this scenario is by ensuring each of your online accounts, including your gaming accounts, has its own unique password. Now remember, passwords need to be at least 10 characters, have a combination of numbers, symbols and upper and lower-case letters and have no connection to anything about you at all. I’m a fan of a long, nonsensical sentence but, I’m an even bigger fan of a password manager that can both create and remember these unique passwords for you.

This adds another layer of security by adding an additional stage to the login process.

Where would the modern parent be without online banking? How did our non-digital forefathers ever cope??</p>\n<p>Online banking is just so convenient and basically a necessity of modern life. If you’ve recently tried to conduct a transaction at a branch, then you’ll know exactly what I mean. One of my boys recently tried to set up a new account at a local banking branch and they were told to come back the following day. Instead, we went home and did it online in less than 20 minutes!</p>\n<p>Aussie banks are world class at implementing a range of security measures to keep our banking safe however there are still things we can do to avoid our banking details getting into the hands of hackers. But many of us just assume that ‘all is well’ &#8211; our banking apps work seamlessly, so why do we need to worry? And that’s where many come unstuck. If it doesn’t appear to be broken, why do we need to fix it? Well, being ahead of the risks is how you keep yourself safe, my friends. So, here are my top tips to ensure all your family members are banking online in the securest way possible.</p>\n<h3>1. Ensure You Are Using Legit Banking Apps</h3>\n<p>If you’re changing banks or helping your child set up their online banking, it’s essential that you download your bank’s official app. Imitations do exist! Ideally, download the app from the bank’s website however if this isn’t an option use a genuine app store like Apple’s AppStore or Google Play for Android devices. And always verify the app is legitimate by checking the developer details and reading the reviews.</p>\n<p>Budgeting or financial management apps are an incredibly popular way to help manage finances, but you need to be cautious here too as many will require you to share your banking logins. Always check the app’s reviews, its history of data breaches and its security policies before you download.</p>\n<h3>2. Ensure your Passwords are Long, Strong and Unique</h3>\n<p>Using the name of your puppy, your kids or worse still, your birthday, is one of the fastest ways of getting your banking details into the hands of hackers. Passwords need to have no connection to any part of your life, should never be stored in your banking app or anywhere on your phone and NEVER, EVER written on the back of your debit card!! Here are my top tips:</p>\n<p>Make them long – choose a phrase instead of just 1 word. I love a nonsensical sentence with at least 10 characters.</p>\n<p>Always include lower and uppercase letters, a number or 2 and a few symbols.</p>\n<p>Every online account needs its own unique password – no exceptions.</p>\n<p>Put a reminder in your calendar to update your passwords regularly – at least every 3-6 months.</p>\n<p>All sounds too hard? Try a password manager that will not only create complex passwords that no human could ever think of, but it will also remember then for you.

Say No to Public Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>Geez, public Wi-Fi is convenient, particularly if you are travelling. But, using it to undertake any banking or financial dealings is just too risky in, my opinion. Why? I hear you ask. Well, there are many ways hackers can hack public Wi-Fi, let me share a few:</p>\n<p>‘Evil twin’ attack. This is when hackers set up malicious hotspots with seemingly logical and trustworthy names eg ‘Free Café Wi-Fi’. But as soon as you connect, they can easily get their hands on your data.</p>\n<p>Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM). This is when hackers break into a network and eavesdrop on data as it travels between connected devices and the Wi-Fi router. For example, your online banking password!</p>\n<p>Password cracking attack. Scammers use software that automatically tries a huge volume of usernames and passwords so they can control the router. And once they’ve gained control, they can dupe you into downloading malicious software (that could steal your identity) or redirects you to a webpage that phishes for your personal information.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you can possibly survive without public Wi-fi then you need to invest in a VPN that will ensure everything you share is protected.</p>\n<h3>4. Activate Two Factor Authentication</h3>\n<p>If your bank offers two-factor authentication to its customers, then your answer needs to be ‘yes please’! Two-factor authentication or multi factor authentication adds another layer of verification to your banking which minimises the chances of hacker causing you harm. If you’ve activated it, you’ll be asked to provide another piece of information after you’ve entered your login details. Usually a special code, this may be delivered to you via an app, text message or even an automated phone call.</p>\n<h3>5. Request Alerts From Your Bank</h3>\n<p>It will take just a few minutes to ring your bank and request to be notified when an activity occurs on your account. Every bank will manage this differently, however most banks can alert you on request via email or text if the following occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low or high balances</li>\n<li>New credit and debit transactions</li>\n<li>New linked external accounts</li>\n<li>Failed login attempts</li>\n<li>Password changes</li>\n<li>Personal information updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if anything at all seems a little fishy, contact your bank immediately!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few things are guaranteed in life and that includes your online safety. And whether you’re an online banking fan or not, opting out isn’t really an option. So, take some time to tighten up your online banking. Only use legit apps; change your passwords so they are long, strong and complex; invest in a VPN so you can use public Wi-Fi and say yes to two-factor authentication.

You can’t wait to take time away from your responsibilities, jump out of your daily routine, and splash into a new adventure. You may be taking time off, but you can be sure cybercriminals won’t take a break.</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">While traveling, you may encounter scams, theft, and identity theft that put your personal information, devices, and online privacy in jeopardy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">McAfee’s Safer Summer Holidays Travel Report surveyed 7,000 people across seven countries to discover how safe it is to plan and book travel online, and how cautious people are when interacting with digital tools while traveling abroad.

With inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, the research reveals new concerns for leisure-seekers who, in their quest for a good deal, may be more likely to fall for a scam. With 94% of people booking travel online this year, it can be easy to get lured into a deal that’s too good to be true. In today’s economic environment, adults are more likely to seek out a bargain deal online (56%), move quickly to snap up a deal (45%), try a new booking site (35%) and even a new destination (36%), in order to save money. However, travel seekers need to stay vigilant to avoid falling for a scam. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Travel scams can take many forms, with the research finding 14% of all adults have been tricked into making payments through fraudulent platforms and 18% have had their identity stolen when booking online. Of this portion, 7% entered passport information and 11% provided other personally identifiable information to a fake website.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Discrepancies Between Consumers’ Sentiments and Behaviors</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The research also uncovered a discrepancy between people’s sentiments and behaviors, as well as online safety best practices when travelling. In total, 61% of people are more concerned about digital threats than physical ones, such as being pickpocketed, and 85% of adults hold either some or high concern around their identity being compromised as part of their travel. Despite this, 48% admitted to being less security conscious when on holiday. Whether it’s connecting to Wi-Fi networks even though they look a bit suspicious (22%), using a free USB charging port at an airport or train station (26%), or leaving their Netflix account logged in after checking out of their accommodation (17%), significant numbers of people have engaged in activities that could put them at increased risk of crime while traveling.   </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It’s not that people are unaware of the dangers either. While 44% of people think their personal information is less secure when they connect to the internet while on vacation, less than half (43%) make use of any services to monitor the safety of their online identity, and 50% don’t use a VPN while on vacation. Of those that do, 20% only do so because they want to stream geo-specific content.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Knowing the risks doesn’t stop travelers from engaging in the behavior. While social media is by far the most common online activity for people to use their phones for while on vacation (60%), also common are chatting with friends and family (55%), online banking (35%) and sending money via apps such as PayPal or Venmo (22%). </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">“People are often more relaxed and carefree when away from home, but it’s never been more important to remain vigilant when traveling,” says Cagla Ruacan, McAfee’s Head of Product Strategy and Insights. “From the moment you open your laptop to book a vacation, to when you log into airport Wi-Fi while waiting for the flight home, staying alert and taking precautions helps keep yourself and your loved ones safe from online travel scams. Taking early and proactive steps to manage your security, privacy and online identity means you’ll be able to more safely and confidently enjoy your well-earned vacation.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How to Protect Yourself from Online Summer Travel Scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Be especially aware of your surroundings when you’re on vacation. Pickpockets like to congregate in tourist hotspots, at home and abroad. They take advantage of distracted out-of-towners or awestruck sightseers who are less aware of suspicious behavior.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Before you leave, familiarize yourself with common pickpocketing schemes. For example, if a stranger on the street asks you the time, avoid eye contact and keep walking. In this scam, the stranger will comment on your watch or try to strike up a conversation while their partner scopes out your back pockets. It seems impolite to ignore someone, but if they truly need to know the time, they can ask someone else. Also, how many people are there who don’t have a time-telling device on them?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When walking around a city or taking public transportation, keep your phone in your front pockets or in a zippered bag that you can hold around your front. Consider buying a phone tether or lanyard for your phone. This will make your phone much more difficult to lift since it’s securely wrapped around your body.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

This way, you can proactively head off any issues that could arise when you should be relaxing. For instance, if your wallet is misplaced or stolen while on vacation, a dark cloud of “what ifs” won’t follow you. What if someone took the contents of your wallet and posted your details online? What if someone used those details to impersonate you online?</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fidentity-monitoring%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Identity monitoring</span></a> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">lessens the possibility of these “what ifs” happening to you.

A frozen credit means that credit bureaus will prevent anyone (including you) from signing up for a new credit card in your name. So, in case your wallet or passport goes missing or you paid with your credit card at an establishment of dubious character, you can sleep soundly knowing that your hard-earned credit score is intact. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s a good idea to lock your credit before an incident occurs because speed is key to heading off a thief. Additionally, if you’re traveling abroad, it may be difficult to connect to phone numbers in your home country, especially if you didn’t sign up for a roaming cellular plan.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

A VPN is software that scrambles your internet traffic, making it nearly impossible for a cybercriminal to digitally eavesdrop.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When traveling, especially if you don’t sign up for a roaming cellular or data plan, you’ll rely solely on public Wi-Fi networks in hotels, restaurants, libraries, and transportation hubs. Even if your accommodation’s network is password protected and is offered only to guests, it’s still best to surf with the protection of a VPN because you can’t be sure of the intentions of the hundreds of people connected to it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">VPNs aren’t difficult to set up and once you’re up and running they’re easy to use and do not slow your internet speed. But because you’d rather be poolside instead of comparing VPN plans, it’s best to sign up and become acquainted with the software before you jet off.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5. Prepare for the Possibilities</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The best defense against cybercriminals and thieves is to arm yourself with knowledge. The more aware you are of their schemes, the better you can sniff them out and avoid them. A few weeks before you leave on vacation, check the news and read up on reports about common emerging scams. For example, be wary of public charging stations as criminals are pumping USB charging ports with malware, according to the FBI.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Awareness of schemes like this one can help you better prepare before you leave for vacation. Always leave enough time to fully charge your device before adventuring for the day and consider packing your own power bank if your device’s battery life is unreliable. Also, if you’re traveling to another country, make sure to pack a plug converter so you can plug your devices into outlets instead of USB ports.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Vacation With Cyber Confidence</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is an excellent everyday online security partner.

The name raises all kinds of questions. What is the dark web, really? Where is it? Can anyone hop on it?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Answering these questions can help you stay safer online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The story of the dark web is a complicated one. It’s a small and highly anonymous layer of the internet. As a result, it has a reputation for harboring criminal activity. We often mention the dark web in our blogs, typically when the conversation turns to identity theft, data breaches, and stolen personal information. Rightfully so. Plenty of cybercrime can get traced right back to the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet cybercriminals didn’t create the dark web. And they’re far from the only people who use it. News outlets like the BBC and the </span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">New York Times</span></i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> have a presence there, as does the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Journalists, activists, and everyday citizens use it as well, often to work around oppressive censorship. Even Facebook is there, providing people access to the social media site in regions where it’s blocked.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Anonymity reigns on the dark web. It was designed to work that way. With that, it’s home to a mixed bag of activity, legitimate and illicit alike. Yet that anonymity doesn’t stop us from putting a face onto the dark web—from understanding what it is, where it is, and what transpires there. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That starts with a look at the internet and the two primary layers that make it up.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">The layers of the internet: The surface web and the deep web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you visualize the internet as an ocean, you’ll find it populated with websites and collections of data at all depths. Yet, the typical internet user only has access to the first few feet, a layer of the internet known as the surface web. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The sights you’ll see within the surface web will look familiar. It’s all the blogs, shops, social media sites, and so on that you visit regularly. And it’s easy to get to. You only need to fire up your browser and go. All the sites are public facing. With a quick search, you can find them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In all, the surface web contains any destination you can reach through search. To put it more precisely, the surface web accounts for areas of the internet that search engines can “crawl” and index for search. Estimates vary, yet the surface web accounts for roughly 4 to 5% of the internet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, enter the deep web, the next 95% of the internet that is not searchable. Yet, that’s not to say that you don’t travel down into its depths from time to time. In fact, you likely do it daily. Any time you go through a paywall or use a password to access internet content, you’re entering the deep web. The content found there is hidden from search. Examples include logging into your bank account, accessing medical records through your healthcare provider, or using corporate web pages as part of your workday. Even streaming a show can involve a trip to the deep web. None of that content is searchable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As such, the overwhelming majority of activity within the deep web is legitimate. So while this layer of the internet runs deep, it isn’t necessarily dark. The dark web is something altogether different.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is the dark web?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The dark web lives within the deep web. Like the other depths of the deep web, it’s not searchable. The people behind the websites and data collections on the dark web intentionally keep them hidden from search. And the reasons vary. Some of them are entirely legitimate, others questionable, and several are outright illegal in nature. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Its origins go back to the 1990s, when the U.S. Department of Defense developed the dark web as a means of anonymous and encrypted communications. That story might sound familiar. It’s quite like the origin story for the broader internet. That had its roots in the Department of Defense as well. So, just as the broader internet eventually became available to the public, so did the dark web as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Getting there requires a special browser because the protocols for the dark web differ from the surface web. Moreover, these browsers strip web traffic of identifiable information, encrypt it, and send it through a series of server jumps. The browsing traffic will appear to go through a server in one country, then a different server in another, and then another. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">These steps make it highly difficult to identify the person using the browser. On the flip side, it makes it difficult to identify the people hosting the sites and services on the dark web as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Without question, privacy is everything on the dark web. For good and for bad.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Legitimate uses of the dark web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While the notion of the dark web typically gets raised in the context of cybercrime and other illegal activity, it has legitimate uses. Some of these use cases include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Circumventing censorship </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Well-regarded news outlets such as the BBC and Pro Publica maintain a presence on the dark web to ensure that anyone can access their reporting. This includes people in nations and regions where certain news sources are censored. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Private communication</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For the particularly privacy-conscious, the dark web hosts several resources for encrypted communication. That includes email clients, internet chat, and even social media sites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whistleblowing</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Anonymous tips are a part of national security, law enforcement, and journalism as well. The private nature of the dark web confers an additional degree of anonymity to tipsters.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The dark web isn’t a place everyday internet users will need, or even want, to go. It’s far more complicated than the surface web—and going in without taking several security measures can make the trip a risky one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The dark web as a marketplace for cybercrime</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is where the rubber meets the road from an online protection </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">standpoint. T</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">he dark web is also a marketplace for hackers and bad actors. In several ways—as a place to purchase and rent malware, a repository for stolen information, and a place to communicate and coordinate attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For starters, the dark web is populated with dark marketplaces. And difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency is the coin of the realm. With dark web stores stocked with ready-made malware kits, bad actors can launch attacks with little need for technical expertise. Others have done the work for them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cybercrime groups of all sizes prop up these shops, which they also use to rent out other services for attacks. For example, a small-time bad actor could easily lease a </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Finternet-security%2Fwhat-is-a-botnet-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-protecting-smart-home-devices%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">botnet</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to wage an attack that slows a targeted website to a crawl. Some cybercrime groups will provide hackers who can run attacks on someone else’s behalf, creating a mercenary “hacker for hire” gig economy. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, information stolen from a data breach can end up in dark web marketplaces as well. The personal information posted in these marketplaces can range anywhere from emails and passwords to in-depth information like tax numbers, health information, and driver’s license numbers. Some of it goes up for sale. Some of it gets dumped there for free. With the right information in hand, cybercriminals can commit acts of identity theft. That includes claiming unemployment benefits and tax refunds in someone else’s name. In extreme cases, it can lead to bad actors can outright impersonate their victims, racking up debts and criminal records along the way.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some hacking groups sell hacked accounts outright. For a couple hundred dollars, they offer up login and password information for bank accounts that have a couple thousand dollars in them. Also available, pre-hacked email, social media, and online payment accounts. If it’s hackable and has value, it’s likely for sale on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protect yourself from hackers and bad actors on the dark web</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With all this shady activity on the dark web, you might wonder how you can protect yourself. In fact, you can take several steps to help prevent your information from finding its way there. And you also can take other steps if your information unfortunately does end up on the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Installing online protection software is the first step. Online protection software can help prevent many of the attacks bad actors can purchase on the dark web. It protects against ransomware, adware, spyware, and all manner of malware, whether it’s pre-existing or entirely new. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet today’s online protection goes far beyond antivirus. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive protection like ours protects your privacy and identity as well</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

And that means each one carries a varying degree of risk if it gets breached. Moreover, some sites and services protect data better than others, which adds another dimension of risk.

It lets you have uncannily human conversations with an AI that’s been programmed and fed with information over several generations of development. Provide it with an instruction or ask it a question, and the AI provides a detailed response.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Unsurprisingly, it has millions of people clamoring to use it.

What’s more, they charge people a fee to use them—a prime example of fleeceware. OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, have just officially launched their iOS app for U.S. iPhone users and can be </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com.mcas.ms%2Fapp%2Fopenai-chatgpt%2Fid6448311069%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">downloaded from the Apple App Store here.</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The official Android version is still yet to be released. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fleeceware mimics a pre-existing service that’s free or low-cost and then charges an excessive fee to use it. Basically, it’s a copycat. An expensive one at that. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fleeceware scammers often lure in their victims with “a free trial” that quickly converts into a subscription. However, with fleeceware, the terms of the subscription are steep. They might bill the user weekly, and at rates much higher than the going rate.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The result is that the fleeceware app might cost the victim a few bucks before they can cancel it. Worse yet, the victim might forget about the app entirely and run up hundreds of dollars before they realize what’s happening. Again, all for a simple app that’s free or practically free elsewhere.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What makes fleeceware so tricky to spot is that it can look legit at first glance. Plenty of smartphone apps offer subscriptions and other in-app purchases. In effect, fleeceware hides in plain sight among the thousands of other legitimate apps in the hopes you’ll download it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">With that, any app that charges a fee to use ChatGPT is fleeceware. ChatGPT offers basic functionality that anyone can use for free. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There is one case where you might pay a fee to use ChatGPT.

They might mention three-day trials that automatically convert to pricey monthly or weekly subscriptions. Moreover, they might describe how payment terms have changed and become more costly as a result. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In the case of legitimate apps, billing issues can arise from time to time, so see how the company handles complaints. Companies in good standing will typically provide links to customer service where people can resolve any issues they have. Company responses that are vague, or a lack of responses at all, should raise a red flag.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Be skeptical about overwhelmingly positive reviews.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Scammers are smart. They’ll count on you to look at an overall good review of 4/5 stars or more and think that’s good enough. They know this, so they’ll pack their app landing page with dozens and dozens of phony and fawning reviews to make the app look legitimate. This tactic serves another purpose: it hides the true reviews written by actual users, which might be negative because the app is a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Filter the app’s reviews for the one-star reviews and see what concerns people have. Do they mention overly aggressive billing practices, like the wickedly high prices and weekly billing cycles mentioned above? That might be a sign of fleeceware. Again, see if the app developer responded to the concerns and note the quality of the response. A legitimate company will honestly want to help a frustrated user and provide clear next steps to resolve the issue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Steer clear of third-party app stores.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Google Play does its part to keep its virtual shelves free of malware-laden apps with a thorough submission </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">process,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> as </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.googleblog.com.mcas.ms%2F2021%2F04%2Fhow-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8&amp;McasTsid=20892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">reported by Google</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Your privacy. Because it’s a commodity </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">on today’s internet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For starters, you have advertisers and internet service providers (ISPs) that want to know what you’re doing, when you’re doing it, where you’re doing it, and even for how long you’re doing it. They gather and use this information to create targeted ad profiles. And </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">sometimes</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, they sell that information to third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Next,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> there are the hackers and identity thieves out there. They take an even greater interest in what you’re doing online—like your shopping, banking, and finances. Even your insurance and medical matters. Primarily they want that information so they can turn a buck by hijacking your accounts or impersonating you to get medical care. In more extreme cases, they </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> use stolen information to impersonate you in other ways. That </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> include opening entirely new lines of credit or getting a driver’s license in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN can prevent this kind of snooping from happening.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">VPNs and privacy—blocking ads and data collection</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As for data collection and ads, that activity should come as no surprise. Particularly for anyone who’s seen uncannily targeted ads follow them around on the internet. Search for “summer cargo pants” one time and suddenly the sites you visit are full of ads for pants, pants, and more pants. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Aside from gathering your online activity for advertising purposes, ISPs might also sell the data they gather to third parties. They can gather that data while you’re on your home network, and they might gather it while you’re using public Wi-Fi. (Some ISPs provide free Wi-Fi in public places that allows them to collect data from people who aren’t their regular customers.)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This practice varies by region and the data privacy laws that are in place in each one. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, the European Union has strict data privacy laws that prevent this type of sale. (Thanks to the enactment of the GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation.) However, there are few such protections in the U.S. There, an ISP can sell the browsing history of an internet user to a third party—provided the data has been anonymized.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“Anonymized” is a key term here. It refers to the process of stripping away personal identifiers that connect a person to a set of stored data. It </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> also include adding “noise” to the data, which obscures personal identifiers. For example, that might remove an exact birthdate and replace it with a broad range of dates. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, “March 31, 1957” becomes “January – June 1957.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At issue is that this anonymized data can get de-anonymized rather easily. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Researchers in 2019 found that “</span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com.mcas.ms%2Farticles%2Fs41467-019-10933-3%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">99.98% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> using 15 demographic attributes.” And when you consider how much data is collected about you, 15 attributes are </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">only</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> drops in the ocean.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Marketing and analytics companies collect hundreds and hundreds of data points on people and their households.

Turn off geo-tagging. </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is a good practice on any social media platform. Geo-tagging is a function where the app uses GPS to track your location and then publish it alongside your post. This feature may put your personal safety at risk, since stalkers can use the geotag, context clues, and video background to guess at your location. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Disable tracking and targeted ads.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and gaming apps depend on advertisers’ dollars to make money. To provide users with the most relevant ads (and improve their chances of making a sale), companies gather information about you and build a profile based on your online comings and goings. Most apps that allow tracking must ask your permission first to do so. Always uncheck this box and disable ad tracking, because there’s no guarantee that the PII the ad company collects will stay a secret. Did you know that 98% of people have their personal information up for sale on the internet? </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=f877f81cf7546c824b14a276afc89aae07bcb6319cd9a453cb53777117063c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is an excellent tool to erase your private details from the internet and keep it out of the hands of strangers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

If they know the passcode or if the phone is unlocked, they can tamper with the phone’s settings and install the spyware themselves. This requires access, time, and effort, yet some bad actors certainly take this approach. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Surprisingly, we’ve also seen cases where malware comes pre-installed on phones. A recent case estimated that some 9 million smartphones had spyware installed in them somewhere along the supply chain. Reportedly, the spyware could steal personal information from the phone or possibly take it over entirely for a short stretch of time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can spot signs of tampering on an Android phone by heading to Settings and searching for “Install Unknown Apps.” If you see any sources that you didn’t set to the “On” position or a third-party website you don’t recognize, it indicates that apps from outside official app stores could have been installed in the device. Such apps are generally riskier than apps from official sources like Google Play. While not an outright indication of spyware, you should set those to “Off.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On an iPhone, directly installing spyware takes a bit more effort. Typically, it requires “jailbreaking” the phone. This process tampers with the operating system and removes software restrictions so the iPhone can access third-party app stores and download unapproved apps. Both are highly risky activities and the reason why Apple’s iOS enforces such restrictions in the first place. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Put plainly, “jailbreaking” is not safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the hands of bad actors, they can install an app called “Cydia” on a jailbroken iPhone. Cydia is an unapproved app store that offers potentially dangerous modifications and apps. If you spot Cydia on your iPhone, it’s certain sign of tampering.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The signs of mobile spyware</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not long ago, you could often see or even feel if your smartphone was infected with spyware. It could run hot, like it was left out on blanket at the beach, because the spyware ate up computing cycles while it ran in the background. It could drain batteries or lead to sluggish performance. That’s not always the case anymore. Spyware has become leaner and more efficient in recent years, so cybercriminals can better mask their attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some signs that are better indicators of spyware include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spikes in data use.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whether through your phone’s data connection or through a Wi-Fi connection, unexpected increases in usage could be a sign that your phone is communicating with a third party.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Difficulty logging into your accounts the first time.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A phone infected with spyware may communicate your activity to a third party, rather than to the legitimate login.

Third-party sites may very well not, and they may intentionally host malicious apps as part of a front. Further, Google is quick to remove malicious apps from their store once discovered, making shopping there safer still. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

If an app asks for way more than you bargained for, like a simple puzzle game that requests access to your camera or microphone, it might be a scam. On Android, recent spyware usually requests REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS permission to execute the malicious behavior in the background. If you see behaviors like these, delete the app. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

FOMO can lead them to spend too much time and money on social media, neglect their family or school responsibilities, or engage in risky behaviors to fit in with or impress others. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Suggestion: Help your child understand that it&#8217;s normal to sometimes have FOMO feelings.

While there is no specific Aussie law that dictates the minimum age kids need to be to join social media, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-au%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">most social media platforms require their users to be 13 years old</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to set up an account.

Some do with the consent of their parents, but many don’t. So, if your kids are consulting you on their move into social media, then pat yourself on the back. You’ve done a great job in keeping the lines of communication open and staying relevant. But if yours just charged ahead without involving you (like some of mine did) then it’s still not too late to be part of their journey.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In my opinion, there is no simple answer. A one size fits all approach doesn’t work here. Some kids mature faster than their peers, others may have a bigger dose of emotional intelligence and instinctively understand the ramifications of poor online behaviour. Some kids are more resilient and robust while others are more sensitive. There are so many things to consider when advising but ultimately, this is your call as a parent.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Can I Keep Them Safe?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is where many of us can come unstuck because it can feel so overwhelming knowing where to start.

And these strategies are relevant to all of us parents – regardless of whether your kids are new to social media or old hands!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Asking them what they do online, why they like a certain app and who they play online games with are just some of the ways of starting a conversation. I am also a fan of sharing details of your online life with them too. Whether its sharing new apps with my kids, funny posts, or relevant news articles, I think if I regularly demonstrate that I get social media then I generate a little ‘tech cred’. And when you’ve got ‘tech cred’, they are more likely to come to you when things aren’t going swimmingly. And that’s exactly what we want as parents!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

Passwords</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Without a doubt, one of the most powerful ways to stay safe online is to ensure you have super duper passwords for each of your online accounts. So, take some time to ensure your kids have got this covered. Every online account needs its own individual password that should have no link to your child’s name, school, family, or favourite pet. I’m a big fan of a crazy sentence – I find they are easier to remember. If you include at least one capital letter, a few numbers, and symbols then you’re doing well. Password managers can be a great way of remembering and also generating complex passwords. These can be a godsend when your list of online accounts grows. All you need to do is remember the master password. How good!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And ensure they know to NEVER share passwords. Tell them that passwords are like toothbrushes – never to be shared! That always worked with my boys!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

Now, this is not ideal for anyone but particularly not a young tween who is trying to find their feet online. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, take some time to help your kids turn activate the privacy settings on all their online accounts.

However, with four kids of my own, I know that curveballs and challenges are often inevitable. But if you’ve developed an open line of communication with your kids and possibly even generated a little ‘tech cred’, then it is likely they will reach out to you if things go awry. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Depending on the issue they are experiencing, you may just need to talk them through the situation. Perhaps they need help understanding they should have expressed something in a less inflammatory way or that they may be over-reacting to a comment. It may be helpful for you to work with them to develop an action plan or formulate a response to someone who is perhaps being a bit tricky.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But if they have experienced behaviour that you consider to be unacceptable, then you may need to take further action. I always recommend taking screen shots of concerning behaviour online. These may be important if you need to take further action down the track. Once you’ve taken screen shots, then block the person who is causing your child grief. You can also report the behaviour to the social media platform. If the perpetrator goes to the same school as your child, then I would approach the school and ask them to assist.

They oversee large cybercrime operations that run much like a business. They employ web designers, coders, marketing teams, and customer call centers that mimic a genuine online retailer. Which makes sense. The more they can look and act like the real thing, the more likely they can lure victims into their online stores.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Smaller bands of scammers get in on this action as well.

They’ll bait shoppers with hard-to-find items, tout steep discounts on other popular items, and otherwise play into the rush of holiday gift buying. Yet they crop up year-round as well. Really, any time you shop is a time to be on the lookout for them. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Top tips for safer shopping online</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1.

Directly typing in the correct address for online stores and retailers is a prime way to avoid scammers online. In the case of retailers that you don’t know much about, the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) asks shoppers to do their research. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ensure</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that the retailer has a good reputation. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbb.org.mcas.ms%2Fsearch%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">The BBB makes that easier with a listing of retailers</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> you can search by typing in their name. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Also in the U.S., you can visit the website of your state’s Secretary of State.

It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4.

Another key difference: when fraud occurs with a debit card, you fight to get your money back—it’s gone straight out of your account. With a credit card, the issuer fights to get their money back. They’re the ones who take the financial hit.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Additionally, in the U.S., the Fair Credit Billing Act offers the public protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards. The act gives citizens the power to dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly. Note that many credit card companies have their own policies that improve upon the Fair Credit Billing Act as well. However, debit cards aren’t afforded the same protection under the Act. Avoid using a debit card while shopping online and use your credit card instead.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

It adds a one-time-use code to access your login procedure, typically sent to your smartphone by text or call. Together, that makes it tougher for a crook to hack your account. If any of your accounts support two-factor authentication, the few extra seconds it takes to set up is more than worth the big boost in protection you’ll get.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

They might be legitimate businesses, yet they might be fronts for a convincing-looking scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These ads end up on social media the same way ads from legitimate businesses do, by way of social media ad platforms. Social media companies created these platforms so advertisers can reach millions of individual users based upon their age group, hobbies and interests, past purchases, and so on. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, a scammer </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> target younger shoppers with an interest in retro fashion.

Yet they present some security issues. With effort, fingerprints can get copied, such as by lifting them off a pane of glass or other things you touch. Facial ID can open a phone even when the owner’s eyes are closed. Again with some effort, a thief or bad actor can open the phone by placing it by the sleeping owner’s face. Note that these are more extreme cases, yet you should be aware of them when determining how you lock your phone. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Turn on “Find My Phone.”</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Another powerful tool you have at your disposal is the find my phone feature made possible thanks to GPS technology.

Treat your phone like the desirable item it is. That’s a big step when it comes to preventing theft.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keep your phone close.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And by close, we mean on your person. It’s easy to leave your phone on the table at a coffeeshop, on a desk in a shared workspace, or on a counter when you’re shopping. Thieves might jump on any of these opportunities for a quick snatch-and-grab. You’re better off with your phone in your pocket or zipped up in a bag that you keep close.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Secure your bags and the devices you carry in them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Enterprising thieves will find a way. They’ll snatch your bag while you’re not looking.

If you’re stopping to grab a bite to eat, sling the handles through a chair leg. If you have a strong metal carabiner, you can use that too. Securing your bag like that can make it much tougher for a thief to walk by and swipe it. For extra security, look into a slash-resistant bag.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Stay aware.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Thieves will also look for an easy mark. People who appear a little distracted, lost, or even dozing off. Aside from securing your bags, keep an eye on your surroundings. Look at people and smile, walk with purpose, and generally put across an air of confidence. Behavior like this sends a clear signal to thieves—you’re aware. That might be enough for them to pass you up.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Consider what you’re carrying—and where you carry it.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you have a credit card and ID holder attached to the back of your phone, you might want to remove your cards from it.

There’s something about somebody who can tell a funny story that I just love. And humour can be a great bonding experience for us humans. Laughing over a funny video or sharing a hilarious story is pure friendship gold! But humour can often be murky territory online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Kids Love Humour</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of my favourite things about being a mum of boys is the jokes. My boys can make me laugh till I cry. And the jokes and banter they share amongst themselves warms my heart. Sometimes it feels like slapstick comedy other times its brutal and direct and often a little cheeky. Over the years, ‘safe’ boundaries have been developed for their banter so that no-one gets hurt. But it hasn’t always been perfect. It takes a certain level of maturity and a healthy dose of empathy to know where to draw the line with your humour and, unfortunately, not everyone gets this right.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When Is a Joke Just a Joke</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">All friends will joke around with each other, and our tweens and teens are no exception. Whether it’s sharing comments on funny memes or TikTok’s or leaving witty comments on each other’s online posts, online banter can be quite the demonstration of friendship and connection. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But sometimes it is hard to tell if someone is just having fun or trying to ridicule or make fun of another online. Without being able to see someone’s face and read their body language in person, the joker’s intention can often be ambiguous. It may be laughed off with a ‘just kidding’ or ‘relax, you’re too serious’. And so, here we are in the grey area. One of the most common questions I am asked by parents is how to differentiate between jokes and cyberbullying online. And my answer is simple.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you feel hurt by a joke or think others are laughing at you (instead of with you) then the joke has gone too far. Yes, we all have different levels of sensitivity but if you are offended then it’s time to take some action. Now, if it continues after asking for it to stop and you are still feeling upset then this is bullying. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It really is simple – a joke is intended to be humorous without causing harm whereas bullying is intended to cause harm to others. And, of course jokes can sometimes go too far but in most cases an apology and an explanation can remedy any hurt. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When To Take A Stand</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Navigating friendships when you’re in thick of being a teenager can be really tough for some kids particularly those who aren’t as mature or worldly as others. Kids who are a little younger or less experienced with life may feel that they are on the outskirts of their social group. And in my experience, this can be a tough place to be. Regardless of how many times we tell our kids that being popular or accepted doesn’t matter, when you’re 15 it really can. So, if your shy 15-year-old receives a joking message from a kid at school (who he’d like to be friends with) that upsets him, do you need to take action? Or will it jeopardise any chance your child might have to be friends with this child?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I always like to give a person the benefit of the doubt. So, my advice here would be to continue to monitor the situation. If your child receives additional messages that upset him, then he needs to ask the ‘joker’ to stop. Some kids would be OK to manage this themselves while others might need some help. If they need help, I suggest contacting the school or sporting club that your kids have in common and asking them to intervene. Do not contact the child directly yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Teach Your Kids What To Do If They Are Cyberbullied</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of the best things you can do for your kids is ensure they know what to do if they are on the receiving end of behaviour online that they find upsetting.

Messages like these have an urgency to them, and they seem like they’re legit, or they at least seem like they might deal with something you might care about. But of course they’re just a ruse. And some of them can look and sound rather convincing. Or at least convincing enough that you’ll not only give them a look, but that you’ll also give them a click too.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And that’s where the troubles start.

A text comes through with a brief message that one of your accounts needs attention, from an entirely unknown number. Along with it is a link that you can tap to follow up, which will send you to a malicious site. In some cases, the sender may skip the link and attempt to start a conversation with the aim of getting you to share your personal information or possibly fork over some payment with a gift card, money order, rechargeable debit card, or other form of payment that is difficult to trace and recover.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the case of social media, you can expect that the attack will come from an imposter account that’s doing its best to pose as one of those legitimate businesses or organizations we talked about, or perhaps as a stranger or even someone you know. And the name and profile pic will do its best to play the part. If you click on the account that sent it, you may see that it was created only recently and that it has few to no followers, both of which are red flags. The attack is typically conversational, much like described above where the scammer attempts to pump you for personal info or money.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Attacks that come by direct messaging apps will work much in the same way. The scammer will set up a phony account, and where the app allows, a phony name and a phony profile pic to go along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email gets a little more complicated because emails can range anywhere from a few simple lines of text to a fully designed piece complete with images, formatting, and embedded links—much like a miniature web page. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the past, email phishing attacks looked rather unsophisticated, rife with poor spelling and grammar, along with sloppy-looking layouts and images.

Still, they do several things to try and be convincing. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look right for some reason.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, plus the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in at the top of the email with mention of “There are (42) viruses on your computer.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken all together, you can spot many email scams by taking a closer look, seeing what doesn’t feel right, and then trusting you gut. But that asks you to slow down, take a moment, and eyeball the email critically. Which people don’t always do. And that’s what scammers count on.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Similar ploys see scammers pose as legitimate companies and retailers, where they either ask you to log into a bogus account page to check statement or the status of an order. Some scammers offer links to “discount codes” that are instead links to landing pages designed steal your account login information as well. Similarly, they may simply send a malicious email attachment with the hope that you’ll click it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In other forms of email phishing attacks, scammers may pose as a co-worker, business associate, vendor, or partner to get the victim to click a malicious link or download malicious software. These may include a link to a bogus invoice, spreadsheet, notetaking file, or word processing doc—just about anything that looks like it could be a piece of business correspondence. Instead, the link leads to a scam website that asks the victim “log in and download” the document, which steals account info as a result. Scammers may also include attachments to phishing emails that can install malware directly on the device, sometimes by infecting an otherwise everyday document with a malicious payload.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Email scammers may also pose as someone you know, whether by propping up an imposter email account or by outright hijacking an existing account. The attack follows the same playbook, using a link or an attachment to steal personal info, request funds, or install malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How to avoid phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While you can’t outright stop phishing attacks from making their way to your computer or phone, you can do several things to keep yourself from falling to them. Further, you can do other things that may make it more difficult for scammers to reach you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Pause and think about the message for a minute.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The content and the tone of the message can tell you quite a lot. Threatening messages or ones that play on fear are often phishing attacks, such angry messages from a so-called tax agent looking to collect back taxes. Other messages will lean heavy on urgency, like the phony McAfee phishing email above that says your license has expired today and that you have “(42)” viruses. And during the holidays, watch out for loud, overexcited messages about deep discounts on hard-to-find items. Instead of linking you off to a proper ecommerce site, they may link you to a scam shopping site that does nothing but steal your money and the account information you used to pay them. In all, phishing attacks indeed smell fishy. Slow down and review that message with a critical eye. It may tip you off to a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Deal directly with the company or organization in question.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks can look rather convincing. So much so that you’ll want to follow up on them, like if your bank reports irregular activity on your account or a bill appears to be past due. In these cases, don’t click on the link in the message. Go straight to the website of the business or organization in question and access your account from there. Likewise, if you have questions, you can always reach out to their customer service number or web page.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Consider, would an income tax collector contact you over social media? The answer there is no. For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fnewsroom%2Fhow-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">in the U.S. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes it quite clear that they will never contact taxpayers via social media</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. (Let alone send angry, threatening messages.) In all, legitimate businesses and organizations don’t use social media as a channel for official communications. They have accepted ways they will, and will not, contact you. If you have any doubts about a communication you received, contact the business or organization in question directly and follow up with one of their customer service representatives. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Don’t download attachments. And most certainly don’t open them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some phishing attacks involve attachments packed with malware like the ransomware, viruses, and keyloggers we mentioned earlier. If you receive a message with such an attachment, delete it. Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them. Scammers will often hijack or spoof email accounts of everyday people to spread malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.Hover over links to verify the URL.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On computers and laptops, you can hover your cursor over links without clicking on them to see the web address. Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all. Or maybe it looks like it almost does, yet it adds a few letters or words to the name. This marks yet another sign that you may have a phishing attack on your hands. Scammers also use the common tactic of a link shortener, which creates links that almost look like strings of indecipherable text. These shortened links mask the true address, which may indeed be a link to scam site. Delete the message. If possible, report it. Many social media platforms and messaging apps have built-in controls for reporting suspicious accounts and messages.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6.

As for those people who contact you out of the blue, be suspicious. Sad to say, they’re often scammers canvassing these platforms for victims. Better yet, where you can, set your profile to private, which makes it more difficult for scammers select and stalk you for an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">7.

Chances are, they pulled that information off a data broker site. Data brokers buy, collect, and sell detailed personal information, which they compile from several public and private sources, such as local, state, and federal records, plus third parties like supermarket shopper’s cards and mobile apps that share and sell user data. Moreover, they’ll sell it to anyone who pays for it, including people who’ll use that information for scams. You can help reduce those scam texts and calls by removing your information from those sites. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">8.

Whether they’re out to crack your bank account, steal personal information, or both, you can learn how to spot phishing emails and keep yourself safe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And some of today’s phishing emails are indeed getting tougher to spot. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They seem like they come from companies you know and trust, like your bank, your credit card company, or services like Netflix, PayPal, and Amazon.

Scammers have leveled up their game in recent years. Their phishing emails can look convincing. Not long ago, you could point to misspellings, lousy grammar, poor design, and logos that looked stretched or that used the wrong colors. Poorly executed phishing attacks like that still make their way into the world. However, it’s increasingly common to see far more sophisticated attacks today. Attacks that appear like a genuine message or notice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Case in point:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168907\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal.png 338w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-300x252.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-154x129.png 154w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Say you got an email that said your PayPal account had an issue.

Who sent the phishing email that directed us to this malicious site? None other than “paypal at inc dot-com.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168893\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ppal-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"96\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Clearly, that’s a phony email. And typical of a phishing attack where an attacker shoehorns a familiar name into an unassociated email address, in this case “inc dot-com.” Attackers may also gin up phony addresses that mimic official addresses, like “paypalcustsv dot-com.” Anything to trick you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, the malicious site that the phishing email sent us to used a spoofed address as well. It had no official association with PayPal at all—which is proof positive of a phishing attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that companies only send emails from their official domain names, just as their sites only use their official domain names. Several companies and organizations will list those official domains on their websites to help curb phishing attacks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com.mcas.ms%2Ftc%2Fwebapps%2Fmpp%2Fsecurity%2Fcommon-scams%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">PayPal has a page that clearly states how it will and will not contact you</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

The scammers try to mimic the McAfee brand, yet don’t pull it off. Still, they do several things to try to act convincing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168823\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"184\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1.png 184w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ad-1-85x129.png 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look like what McAfee usually sends me.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, and the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in with </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a mention</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of “There are (42) viruses on your computer …”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken all together, someone can readily spot that this is a scam with a closer look.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This next ad falls into the less sophisticated category.

That’s a big one. Maybe it’s an angry-sounding email from a government agency saying that you owe back taxes. Or maybe it’s another from a family member asking for money because there’s an emergency.

Phishing attacks begin by stirring up your emotions and getting you to act quickly. Scammers </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> use threats or overly excitable language to create that sense of urgency, both of which are clear signs of a potential scam.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Granted, legitimate businesses and organizations </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> reach out to notify you of a late payment or possible illicit activity on one of your accounts. Yet they’ll take a far more professional and even-handed tone than a scammer would. For example, it’s highly unlikely that your local electric utility will angrily shut off your service if you don’t pay your past due bill immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">They want you to pay a certain way.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Gift cards, cryptocurrency, money orders—these forms of payment are another sign that you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> be looking at a phishing attack. Scammers prefer these methods of payment because they’re difficult to trace. Additionally, consumers have little or no way to recover lost funds </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">from these payment methods</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Legitimate businesses and organizations </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">won&#8217;t</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> ask for payments in those forms.

Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all. Or maybe it does somewhat, yet it adds a few letters or words to the name. This marks yet another sign that you </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> have a phishing attack on your hands.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, if the message contains a web link, closely examine that as well. If the name looks at all unfamiliar or altered from the way you’ve seen it before, that </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">might</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> also mean you’re looking at a phishing attempt.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protect yourself from phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Go directly to the source.</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Some phishing attacks can look convincing. So much so that you’ll want to follow up on them, like if your bank reports irregular activity on your account or a bill appears to be past due.

If an email that looks like it came from a family member, friend, or business associate, follow up with them to see if they sent it. Particularly if asks for money, contains a questionable attachment or link, or simply doesn’t sound quite like them. Text, phone, or check in with them in person.

Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them.

The NSIS scriptable installer is a highly efficient software packaging utility. The installer behavior is dictated by an NSIS script and users can extend the functionality of the packager by adding custom libraries (dll) known as NSIS plugins. Since its inception, adversaries have abused the utility to deliver malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">NSIS stands for Nullsoft Scriptable Installer. NSIS installer files are self-contained archives enabling malware authors to include malicious assets along with junk data. The junk data is used as Anti-AV / AV Evasion technique.

The Vectored Exception Handling on Windows provides the user with ability to register custom exception handler, which is simply a code logic that gets executed at the event of an exception. The interesting thing about handling exceptions is that the way in which the system resumes its normal execution flow of the program after the event of exception. Adversaries exploit this mechanism and take ownership of the execution flow. Malware can divert the flow to the code which is under its control when the exception occurs.

The pushfd/popfd instructions are followed by the code that when executed throws STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. When program is executed normally, the execution will not reach the code that follows the pushfd/popfd instruction block, thus raising only STATUS_SINGLESTEP. When accidently stepped over the pushfd/popfd block in debugger, the STATUS_SINGLESTEP is not thrown at the debugger as it suppreses this because the debugger is already single stepping through the code, this is detected by the handler logic when we encounter code that follows the pushfd/popfd instruction block wich throws a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. Now it runs into a nested exception situation (the access violation followed by suppressed single stepping exception via trap). Because of this, whenever an access violation occurs, the handler routine checks for nested exception information in _EXCEPTION_POINTERS structure as discussed in the beginning.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Below image shows this the carefully laid out code to detect analysis.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168763\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13.png 652w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13-300x157.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture13-205x107.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Egg hunting: VEH Assisted Runtime Padding</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One interesting feature seen in GULoader shellcode in the wild is runtime padding.

The exfiltrated Personal Identifiable Information (PII) extracted from the compromised endpoints are largely collected and funneled to various underground data selling marketplaces. This also impacts businesses as various critical information used for authentication purposes are getting leaked from the personal systems of the user leading to initial access on the company networks. The GuLoader is heavily used in mass malware campaigns to infect the users with popular stealer malware like Raccoon, Vidar, and Redline.

Banking online. Location tracking. If you are a senior adult, there’s no doubt, the digital leaps and bounds you’re asked to consider each day can be daunting. If you are the child of a senior adult trying to make digital life more accessible, helping your parent consistently stay safe online can also be a challenge.</p>\n<p>According to a recent  <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew study</a> on the topic, senior adults continue to become more digitally connected, but adoption rates continue to trail younger users, and digital divides remain. The study also revealed that 77% of older adults needed assistance in learning how to use technology.</p>\n<h2><strong>Privacy path: Awareness &amp; consistency </strong></h2>\n<p>As a senior, it’s easy to feel intimidated and even try to avoid technology altogether as a safety plan. However, more healthcare, banking, and retailers become almost 100% digital, opting out of digital life is becoming impossible.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s a way forward. As with any challenge, it’s best to begin one step at a time. First, put your stake in the ground by committing to increase your awareness and consistency in the digital realm. Doing so will help you reduce your fear about potential data breaches, malware attacks, or worse, falling prey to an online scam. Here are seven more ways to build upon your privacy path.</p>\n<h2><strong>7 Ways to build up your online privacy  </strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Get on a family protection plan.</strong></h3>\n<p>Online protection software safeguards your privacy while also looking after your privacy too. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\">McAfee+ Family plans</a> include personalized protection for each member of the family, including older family members outside the home. For example, a grandparent can set up and manage their own protection for their identity, privacy, computers, and phones. And inviting a grandparent onto the plan is as simple as sending an email.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-168779\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps.png 284w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steps-205x94.png 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>2. Update and store your passwords.</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/create-strong-passwords-with-a-password-generator/?hilite=%27passwords%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Updating your passwords</a> regularly is an online privacy gamechanger. The only problem? It’s tough to remember all those passwords, so who wants to risk changing them, right? <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consider a password manager</a> (find the software packages that have a password manager built-in). Your Password Manager (PM) stores then populates the username and password fields every time you log on to a favorite site or app. Better yet, it makes changing your password an easy task since you don’t need to do any remembering—your PM does it all for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).</strong></h3>\n<p>What in the world? 2FA sounds complicated! Don’t worry, it’s not. Opting for 2FA means that before logging onto your account, you will have one more step to verify <em>it’s you logging on</em>. When given this privacy option, take it. Commonly, the 2FA process is a code generated by a smartphone app—no biggie. If you want to try, go to your settings in your favorite apps, such as Google or Facebook, and turn on the 2FA option.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Install software updates immediately.</strong></h3>\n<p>Along with strong passwords, updating your software is a front-line defense against identity theft and fraud. Installing software updates (those pesky pop-up notices that are critical to your privacy) is essential in securing your IoT devices, PCs and phones, and the social media, banking, and healthcare portals connected to them.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</strong></p>\n<p>If we could write this one tip down a hundred times without losing our readers, we surely would. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/vpn?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Every senior adult needs a VPN</a> for practical, powerful privacy protection and peace of mind. A VPN keeps credit card and personal info contained in a secure network and away from prying eyes.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Fight back with knowledge.</strong></h3>\n<p>Fraudulent emails connected to <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/cruel-ghouls-new-digital-scams-target-every-age-group/?hilite=%27COVID%27%2C%27scams%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fraudulent websites</a> can look very legitimate. A secure website will have an “HTTPS” in the browser’s address bar. The “s” stands for “secure.” If the web address or URL is just HTTP, it’s not a secure site. Still unsure? Read reviews of the site from other users before making a purchase. Never send cash, cashier’s check, or a personal check to any online vendor. If purchasing, always use a credit card in case there is a dispute. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-reports/how-to-spot-and-prevent-the-tax-scams-that-target-elders/?hilite=%27scams%27%2C%27and%27%2C%27seniors%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stay up-to-date on scams</a> that target seniors specifically. Lately, elder scams have been constructed around COVID, dating apps, tax returns, employment, and, of course, the common <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/8-signs-that-grandmas-getting-baited-by-a-catfish/?hilite=%27elderly%27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">military catfish scams</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Clean up your digital breadcrumbs.</strong></h3>\n<p>Like it or not, companies gather, share, and sell plenty of information about us online. Among them, online data brokers that collect information about people from public records and third parties, like shopping information from the discount cards we use to get deals at the supermarket or drug store. They compile this information and post it online for anyone to see, for a price. And they’ll sell it to anyone. That includes marketers, advertisers, and even bad actors who use it for scams and to help them commit identity theft. You can clean up these digital breadcrumbs, though. Our <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Data Cleanup</a> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. We’ll also provide guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and with select products, we can even manage the removal for you. ​</p>\n<h2><strong>Have fun as you skill up.</strong></h2>\n<p>When trying to boost your digital skills, don’t forget about all the amazing instructional content at your fingertips. A quick search of YouTube will render easy-to-understand videos on how to do just about everything (including install security software, change your router password, secure the smart devices in your home, and how to adjust your privacy settings on any device).</p>\n<p>Learning or building a new skill isn’t always easy, but if you stop to think about it, as a senior, you’ve gained so many skills over your lifetime (far more than your juniors). So, practically speaking, building up your tech skills is one is just one more task to ace. So, lean into the challenge, have fun learning, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/7-savvy-ways-senior-adults-can-safeguard-digital-privacy/\">7 Savvy Ways Senior Adults Can Safeguard Digital Privacy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"New Wave of SHTML Phishing Attacks","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/shtml-phishing-attack-with-blurred-image/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"pubDate":"Mon, 08 May 2023 11:10:18 +0000","category":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee Labs"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=168432"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_SHTML-Phishing-Attacks-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Authored By Anuradha McAfee Labs has recently observed a new wave of phishing attacks.

so malware is restricting all the normal users from turning the Windows Defender on. When attackers disable Windows Defender through the registry, the change is likely to persist even if the user or administrator tries to re-enable it through the Windows Defender settings.

By using the Amadey botnet as a delivery mechanism for other malware, attackers can leverage these same capabilities to evade detection and maintain persistence on infected computers. They can use Amadey to drop a wide range of malware, such as spyware, ransomware, and trojans, which can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, encrypting files for ransom, or taking control of a computer for use in a larger botnet. Our analysis of various samples of this attack has revealed that the Amadey botnet distributes malware from multiple families and is not restricted to Redline Stealer alone.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At McAfee, we are committed to providing our customers with robust and effective antivirus and anti-malware solutions that can detect and protect against threats like the Amadey botnet and other malware families.

I discovered it a few years back when it became apparent that group messages to a close cluster of girlfriends weren’t being received by my Android pals. WhatsApp solved that problem instantly. But then over several years, I realized it solved quite a few other pesky problems namely expensive and tricky phone calls when travelling overseas and my frustration at not being able to send a message to a large group of people. I became a fan girl!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for WhatsApp users, over the years there have been scams including the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcyware.com.mcas.ms%2Fnews%2Fscammers-trick-whatsapp-users-by-offering-1000gb-free-data-on-the-apps-10th-anniversary-085e453b%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">10</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">th</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> birthday scam where users were offered the chance to win 1000GB of free data</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and most recently the </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2F7news.com.au.mcas.ms%2Ftechnology%2Ffresh-warning-about-bizarre-whatsapp-message-you-should-never-respond-to--c-7752914%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">‘mum and dad’</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> scam.

But what does that actually mean? In short, it means that your messages can only be read on the recipient’s phone. Likewise, video and audio calls can only be answered by the intended receiver. WhatsApp encrypts every message sent on its platform which means the only people who can decode it are the sender and the receiver. WhatsApp can’t access anything you share and nor could a hacker if they were to intercept a message. Love end-to-end encryption!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But this doesn’t mean that there are no risks using WhatsApp. Like all online platforms, staying ahead of the risks is the smartest way of ensuring you have the best experience. And there are several steps you can take to stay ahead of the threats on WhatsApp. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My Top Tips To Stay Safe While Using WhatsApp</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Turn On Automatic Updates</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Keeping your WhatsApp software up to date is essential as updates will almost always include fixes or ‘patches’ for new vulnerabilities and threats. Why not automate them to ensure that this happens? This means you won’t be at risk if you forget to update the software yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2.

And this goes for any app – keep your personal information nice and tight. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3.

Ignore Suspicious Messages</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As anyone can message anyone on WhatsApp, it’s inevitable you may receive some random or suspicious looking messages. Always err on the side of caution and do not respond to direct messages from people you don’t know. If you receive a promotional offer from a company that is quite tempting, go directly to their website to confirm. Scammers will often send out 1000’s of emails with a tempting offer and link to a malicious website in the hope that someone will ‘bite’. Don’t be caught in a phishing scam!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">5.

Without your 6-digit pin number, a hacker can’t get into your account, even if they get their hands on the SMS code they need to activate your account on another device. And it takes 30 seconds to set up! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">6. Be Aware Of The Most Common WhatsApp Hacking Strategy</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you haven’t set up your 6-digit pin, then you are at risk at being ‘socially hacked’. This is how it works: a hacker, who has hijacked one of your friend’s accounts, will message you asking for the 6-digit code that’s just been sent to your account. They will say it’s meant for them. And as you ‘know’ this person, you are likely to send that code straight through without even questioning them. But in fact, the 6-digit code in question has been requested by the hacker for your account, so the minute you share it &#8211; you will be immediately locked out! So, never ever share your 6-digit code with anyone. No-one will ever have a legitimate reason to request it.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But please don’t let these risks put you off this fantastic messaging app. I’m a big believer in understanding the challenges so you can prepare yourself, go ahead and enjoy! And I haven’t even touched on some of the more fun aspects of the app – the stickers &amp; the status updates – they can be quite the conversation starter! So go ahead and enjoy but just make sure you’ve done your homework!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Stay safe everyone!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Alex </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-be-safe-on-whatsapp/\">How To Be Safe On WhatsApp</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"The Strongest Passwords and the Best Way to Create (and Remember) Them","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Thu, 04 May 2023 12:36:34 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"password protection"},{"#cdata-section":"World Password Day"},{"#cdata-section":"password manager"},{"#cdata-section":"password management tools"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=167588"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Some of the strongest passwords you can use are the ones you don’t have to remember.  Strange as that may...</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/the-strongest-passwords-and-the-best-way-to-create-and-remember-them/\">The Strongest Passwords and the Best Way to Create (and Remember) Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/300x200_Blog_050423-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some of the strongest passwords you can use are the ones you don’t have to remember.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strange as that may sound, it’s true, if you use a password manager. A password manager creates and securely stores strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts—and does all the remembering for you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">And remembering is the root of the problem when it comes to insecure passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Consider how many passwords you have across all your accounts. Then consider the old passwords for accounts and online forums you no longer use, along with all the times you created a password for an online store that you only shopped at once or twice. All those passwords, it’s too much to keep track of, let alone manage. And that leads to insecure passwords. Simple passwords.

Hackers will look for the quickest payday. In some cases they’ll work with a long list of accounts that they’re trying to break into. If a password on that list proves difficult to crack they’ll move on to the next in the hope that it’ll have a poor password that they can easily crack. It’s a sort of hacker economics. There’s often little incentive for them to spend extra time on a strong password when there are plenty of weak ones in the mix.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">So what do poor passwords look like?

However, this means that if hackers compromise one of your accounts, all your other accounts are vulnerable. This is a favorite tactic of hackers. They’ll target less secure accounts and services and then attempt to re-use those credentials on more secure services like online bank and credit card companies. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"4\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Personal information passwords:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Passwords that include your birthday, dog’s name, or nickname leave you open to attack.

Yet the apps that use location tracking may do more with your location data than that. They may collect it, and in turn sell it to advertisers and potentially other third parties that have an interest in where you go and what you do. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Likewise, cell phone providers have other means of collecting location information from your phone, which they may use for advertising and other purposes as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If that sounds like more than you’re willing to share, know that you can do several things that can limit location tracking on your phone—and thus limit the information that can potentially end up in other people’s hands.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How do Smartphones Track Your Movements?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As we look at the ways you can limit location tracking on your phone, it helps to know the basics of how smartphones can track your movements.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For starters, outside of shutting down your phone completely, your phone can be used to determine your location to varying degrees of accuracy depending on the method used: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">GPS:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> The Global Positioning System, or GPS as many of us know it, is a system of satellites operated by the U.S. government for navigation purposes. First designed for national defense, the system became available for public use in the 1980s. It’s highly accurate, to anywhere between nine to 30 feet depending on conditions and technology used, making it one of the strongest tools for determining a phone’s location. This is what powers location services on cell phones, and thus can help an app recommend a great burger joint nearby.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Cell towers:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Cell phone providers can track a phone’s location by the distance it is to various cell phone towers and by the strength of its signal. The location information this method provides is a bit coarser than GPS, providing results that can place a phone within 150 feet. It’s most accurate in urban areas with high densities of cell phone towers, although it does not always work well indoors as some buildings can weaken or block cell phone signals. One of the most significant public benefits of this method is that it automatically routes emergency services calls (like 911 in the U.S.) to the proper local authorities without any guesswork from the caller.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Public Wi-Fi:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Larger tech companies and internet providers will sometimes provide free public Wi-Fi hotspots that people can tap into at airports, restaurants, coffeehouses, and such. It’s a nice convenience but connecting to their Wi-Fi may share a phone’s MAC address, a unique identifier for connected devices, along with other identifiers on the smartphone. Taken together, this can allow the Wi-Fi hosting company to gather location and behavioral data while you use your phone on their Wi-Fi network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Bluetooth:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> Like with public Wi-Fi, companies can use strategically placed Bluetooth devices to gather location information as well. If Bluetooth is enabled on a phone, it will periodically seek out Bluetooth-enabled devices to connect to while the phone is awake. This way, a Bluetooth receiver can then capture that phone’s unique MAC address. This provides highly accurate location information to within just a few feet because of Bluetooth’s short broadcast range. In the past, we’ve seen retailers use this method to track customers in their physical stores to better understand their shopping habits. However, more modern phones often create dummy MAC addresses when they seek out Bluetooth connections, which helps thwart this practice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now here’s what makes these tracking methods so powerful: in addition to the way they can determine your phone’s location, they’re also quite good at determining your identity too. With it, companies know who you are, where you are, and potentially some idea of what you’re doing there based on your phone’s activity.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Throughout our blogs we refer to someone’s identity as a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces are larger than others, like your Social Security number or tax ID number being among the biggest because they are so unique. Yet if someone gathers enough of those smaller pieces, they can put those pieces together and identify you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Things like your phone’s MAC address, ad IDs, IP address, device profile, and other identifiers are examples of those smaller pieces, all of which can get collected. In the hands of the collector, they can potentially create a picture of who you are and where you’ve been.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What Happens to Your Location Information That Gets Collected?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What happens to your data largely depends on what you’ve agreed to. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In terms of apps, we’ve all seen the lengthy user agreements that we click on during the app installation process. Buried within them are terms put forth by the app developer that cover what data the app collects, how it&#8217;s used, and if it may be shared with or sold to third parties. Also, during the installation process, the app may ask for permissions to access certain things on your phone, like photos, your camera, and yes, location services so it can track you. When you click “I Agree,” you indeed agree to all those terms and permissions. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Needless to say, some apps only use and collect the bare minimum of information as part of the agreement. On the other end of the spectrum, some apps will take all they can get and then sell the information they collect to third parties, such as data brokers that</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> build exacting profiles of individuals, their histories, their interests, and their habits. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In turn, those data brokers will sell that information to anyone, which can be used by advertisers along with identity thieves, scammers, and spammers. And as reported in recent years, various law enforcement agencies will purchase that information as well for surveillance purposes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, some apps are malicious from the start.

Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt malicious code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out.

Back up your data </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A cybercriminal has no leverage if your device doesn’t house anything of value. Back up your most important files every few months, either to the cloud or save them onto a hard drive. This way, if you do get a ransomware infection, you can wipe your device and reinstall your files from the backup.

It’s dangerous to reuse the same password across accounts because all it takes to put your accounts at risk is for one data breach to leak your password onto the dark web. It’s nearly impossible to memorize all your different password and username combinations, so entrust a password manager to store them for you. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Two or multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security, as it requires multiple forms of verification to enter an online account. For instance, you’ll be asked to verify your identity through a one-time code sent to a cellphone or to answer a security question in tandem with a correct password. This additional step in the login process deters ransomware plots because if you store your important documents behind a multi-factor authentication-protected cloud program, the criminal has nothing of value to hold hostage. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">4. Be careful where you click</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Don’t click on links or respond to emails, social media direct messages, and texts from people you don’t know.

Awareness of your digital surroundings is another way to keep your device and PII safe. Steer clear of websites that look sloppy, and do not stream or download content from unofficial sites. Malware is often hidden in links on dubious sites. Try your best to stick to sites that have URLs beginning with “https.” The “s” stands for “secure.” Though not all “https” sites are guaranteed secure, they are generally more trustworthy than plain “http” sites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To safeguard your Wi-Fi connection, protect your home router with a strong password or passphrase. When connecting to public Wi-Fi, confirm with the hotel or café’s staff their official Wi-Fi network name. Then, make sure to connect to a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your online activity, which makes it impossible for someone to digitally eavesdrop. Never access your personal information when on an unprotected public Wi-Fi network. Leave your online banking and shopping for when you’re back on a locked network or VPN you can trust.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, a comprehensive antivirus software can clean up your device of malicious programs it might have contracted. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=ba1878bf5b9fb23f947ed19bdeb213e5161fbe720799051ebb90e3461e198352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes unlimited VPN and antivirus, plus a whole lot more to keep all your devices safe.

They target some of our most important and precious things—our files, our photos, and our information stored on our devices.

Worse yet, paying the ransom is no guarantee the hacker will return them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s what a ransomware attack does. Broadly speaking, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it’s a type of malware that infects a network or a device and then typically encrypts the files, data, and apps stored on it, digitally scrambling them so the proper owners can’t access them.

Small-time hackers and hacking groups can find the tools they need to conduct such attacks by shopping on the dark web, where ransomware is available for sale or for lease as a service (Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS).

Like any other type of malware, it can infect your device via a phishing link or a bogus attachment. It can also end up there by downloading apps from questionable app stores, with a stolen or hacked password, or through an outdated device or network router with poor security measures in place. And as mentioned above, infected storage devices provide another avenue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social engineering attacks enter the mix as well, where </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the hacker poses as someone the victim knows and gets the victim to either download malware or provide the hacker access to an otherwise password-protected device, app, or network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And yes, ransomware can end up on smartphones as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Smartphone ransomware can </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">encrypt files, photos, and the like on a smartphone, just as it can on computers and networks. Yet other forms of mobile ransomware don’t have to encrypt data to make the phone unusable. The “Lockerpin” ransomware that has struck some Android devices in the past would change the PIN number that locked the phone. Other forms of lock screen ransomware would simply paste a warning over the home screen with a “pay up, or else” message.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Still, ransomware isn’t as prevalent on smartphones as it is on computers, and there are several reasons why. For the most part, smartphone ransomware relies on people downloading malicious apps from app stores. Both Google Play and Apple’s App Store both do their part to keep their virtual shelves free of malware-laden apps with a thorough submission process, as reported by </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.googleblog.com.mcas.ms%2F2021%2F04%2Fhow-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Google</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com.mcas.ms%2Fguide%2Fsecurity%2Fapp-security-overview-sec35dd877d0%2Fweb%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Apple</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet, bad actors find ways to sneak malware into the stores. Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt malicious code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further, Android allows users to download apps from third-party app stores that may or may not have a thorough app submission process in place, which can make them more susceptible to hosting malicious apps. Moreover, some third-party app stores are actually fronts for organized cybercrime gangs, built specifically to distribute malware.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Basic steps to protect yourself from a ransomware attack.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">First, back up your data and files.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The people behind these attacks play on one of your greatest fears—that those important and precious things on your device might be gone forever. Yet with a backup, you have little to fear. You can simply restore any data and files that may have come under attack. Consider using a reputable cloud storage service that you protect with a strong, unique password. Similarly, you can back up your data locally on an external drive that you keep disconnected from your network and stored in a secure location. So while a backup won’t prevent an attack, it can most certainly minimize any threat or damage from one.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be careful of what you click.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Ransomware attackers use phishing emails, bogus direct messages in social media, and texts to help install malware on your device. Many of these messages can look quite legitimate, like they’re coming from a brand you know, a financial institution, or even the government. The links embedded in those messages will take you to some form of malicious website where you’re prompted to download a phony file or form—which is actually malware. Similarly, some phishing emails will simply send malware to the recipient in the form of a malicious attachment that masquerades as a legitimate document like an invoice, spreadsheet, or shipping notice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Use online protection software.</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This provides your first line of defense. </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> includes several features that can stop a ransomware attack before it takes root: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Safe surfing features that warn you of malicious downloads, attachments, and websites.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Strong antivirus that spots and neutralizes the latest malware threats with the latest antivirus technologies.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Vulnerability scanners that help keep your device and its apps up to date with the latest security measures.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A firewall that helps prevent intruders from accessing the devices on your network—and the files on them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet more ways you can prevent ransomware attacks.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That list is just for starters.

WhatsApp is no different, where scammers spin up bogus accounts and attempt to start conversations with other users. The way they go about it varies. They may try to kindle a romance scam, they may masquerade as a business representative, or even pose as a tax collector or other government official. The aim is always the same, though. They want to steal your personal information or trick you into forking over your money. Don’t take chances. Don’t talk to strangers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Other scammers will send messages with malicious links. Just as you shouldn’t follow links or open files from strangers in other apps, don’t do open them on WhatsApp either. Those links are simply gateways to scam sites and malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Do you back up your WhatsApp chats?

Even if that is in a relatively secure cloud service such as Apple’s or Google’s. Yet the risk of data breaches remains, as does the risk of a bad actor gaining access to one’s cloud account, such as through a stolen password.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, for an increased degree of privacy and security, you may want to consider disabling cloud backup for your WhatsApp messages.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Protect your phone too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> can protect your phone in the same ways that it protects your laptops and computers.

And how can it make your time online more secure—and a little more private too? Here we’ll take a look at what a VPN is, what it has to offer, and how that benefits you.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What is a VPN and how does it protect me? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN is an app that you install on your device to help keep your data safe as you browse the internet. When you turn on your VPN app, your device makes a secure connection to a VPN server that routes internet traffic. Securely. This keeps your online activity private on any network, shielding it from prying eyes. Thus, while you’re on a VPN, you can browse and bank with the confidence that your passwords, credentials, and financial information are secure. If any malicious actors attempt to intercept your web traffic, they’ll only see garbled content thanks to your VPN’s encryption functionality.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN change my IP address? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every internet connection is assigned a unique set of numbers called an IP address, which is tied to information such as geographic location or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). A VPN replaces your actual IP address to make it look like you’ve connected to the internet from the physical location of the VPN server, rather than your real location. This is just one reason why so many people use VPNs. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How can I use a VPN to change my IP address?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To change your IP address, you simply open your VPN app, select the server location you’d like to connect to, and you’re done. You’re now browsing with a new IP address. If you’d like to make sure your IP has changed, open a browser and search for “What’s my IP address” and click on one of the results. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When should I use a VPN? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">An ideal case for using a VPN is when you’re using public Wi-Fi at the airport, a café, hotel, or just about any place “free Wi-Fi” is offered. The reason being is that these are open networks, and any somewhat enterprising cybercriminal can tap into these networks and harvest sensitive information as a result.

You can use a VPN to help stop advertisers from tracking you. Searches you perform and websites you visit won’t be traced back to you, which can prevent advertisers from gleaning information about you and your online habits in general. Moreover, some ISPs collect the browsing history of their users and share it with advertisers and other third parties. A VPN can prevent this type of collection as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Can a VPN protect my search history? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A VPN protects your search history through the secure connection you share. When you search for a website, or type a URL into your navigation bar, your device sends something called a DNS request, which translates the website into the IP address of the web server. This is how your browser can find the website and serve its content to you. By encrypting your DNS requests, a VPN can hide your search habits and history from those that might use that info as part of building a profile of you. This type of info could be used in a wide variety of ways, from legitimately serving targeted ads to nefarious social engineering.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Are VPNs and “Incognito Mode” and “Private Mode” in browsers the same thing?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that a VPN is quite different and far, far more comprehensive than using “Private Mode” or “Incognito Mode” on your browser. Those modes only hide your search history locally on your device—not from others on the internet, like ISPs and advertisers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Does a VPN make me anonymous? </span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">No, a VPN cannot make you anonymous.

Your IP address is visible to your network provider and to the first relay, which is operated by Apple. Your DNS records are encrypted, so neither party can see the address of the website you’re trying to visit. The second relay, which is operated by a third-party content provider, generates a temporary IP address, decrypts the name of the website you requested, and connects you to the site. All of this is done using the latest internet standards to maintain a high-performance browsing experience while protecting your privacy.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559685&quot;:864,&quot;335559737&quot;:864,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Note that as of this writing, Apple Private Relay is not available in all countries and regions.

Why would a cybercriminal target that smart lightbulb in your living room reading lamp? Networks are only as secure as their least secure device. Thus, if a cybercriminal can compromise that smart lightbulb, it can potentially give them access to the entire home network it is on—along with all the other devices and data on it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These devices make desirable targets for another reason. They can easily get conscripted into botnets, networks of hijacked computers and devices used to amplify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that organize the devices into an attacking host that can flood a target with so much traffic that it cannot operate. DDoS attacks can shut down websites, disrupt service and even choke traffic across broad swathes of the internet. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org.mcas.ms%2Fwiki%2FMirai_(malware)%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">the “Mirai” botnet attack of 2016</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, where hackers targeted a major provider of internet infrastructure?

Well, as the case with many early IoT devices, the fault lies within the weak default passwords that many manufacturers employ when they sell these devices. These passwords include everything from “admin123” to the product’s name. The practice is so common that they get posted in bulk on hacking websites, making it easy for cybercriminals to simply look up the type of device they want to attack.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Complicating security yet further is the fact that </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.fit.edu.mcas.ms%2Facademics-research%2Fapps-for-popular-smart-home-devices-contain-security-flaws-new-research-finds%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">some IoT and smart home device manufacturers introduce flaws in their design, protocols, and code that make them susceptible to attack</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

This could mean that your device and thousands of others just like it all share the same credentials, which makes it painfully easy for a hacker to gain access to them because those default usernames and passwords are often published online. When you purchase any IoT device, set a fresh password using a strong method of password creation, such as ours. Likewise, create an entirely new username for additional protection as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Use multi-factor authentication.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Online banks, shops, and other services commonly offer multi-factor authentication to help protect your accounts—with the typical combination of your username, password, and a security code sent to another device you own (often a mobile phone). If your IoT device supports multi-factor authentication, consider using it there too. It throws a big barrier in the way hackers who simply try and force their way into your device with a password/username combination.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Secure your internet router too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another device that needs good password protection is your internet router. Make sure you use a strong and unique password there as well to help prevent hackers from breaking into your home network. Also consider changing the name of your home network so that it doesn’t personally identify you. Fun alternatives to using your name or address include everything from movie lines like “May the Wi-Fi be with you” to old sitcom references like “Central Perk.” Also check that your router is using an encryption method, like WPA2 or the newer WPA3, which will keep your signal secure.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Upgrade to a newer internet router.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Older routers may have outdated security measures, which may make them more prone to attack.

If you’re using your own, visit a reputable news or review site such as Consumer Reports for a list of the best routers that combine speed, capacity, and security.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Update your apps and devices regularly.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In addition to fixing the odd bug or adding the occasional new feature, updates often address security gaps. Out-of-date apps and devices may have flaws that hackers can exploit, so regular updating is a must from a security standpoint. If you can set your smart home apps and devices to receive automatic updates, even better.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Set up a guest network specifically for your IoT devices.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just as you can offer your guests secure access that’s separate from your own devices, creating an additional network on your router allows you to keep your computers and smartphones separate from IoT devices. This way, if an IoT device is compromised, a hacker will still have difficulty accessing your other devices on your primary network, the one where you connect your computers and smartphones.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Shop smart.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Read trusted reviews and look up the manufacturer’s track record online.

The examples above show how greatly that&#8217;s changed. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Today, hackers use malware to make a profit, whether by holding your device and data hostage, tricking you into revealing your personal information so the hacker can access your financial accounts, or by installing spyware that secretly steals information like passwords and account info while you use your device.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That’s what makes zero-day threats so dangerous for us today. Hackers can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities through different means, but traditionally web browsers have been the most common, due to their popularity. Attackers also send emails with attachments, or you might click a link in the body of an email that automatically downloads malware. All of these could now be putting you at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Likewise, security measures have come a long way since the early days. In particular, the antivirus applications included with today’s comprehensive online protection software have technologies in place that directly combat zero-day threats—specifically artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Without getting too technical about it, strong antivirus uses AI and ML to sniff out malware by looking at how an application or device is behaving and if that behavior looks suspicious based on past patterns. In other words, strong antivirus is smart. It can detect, block, and remove zero-day threats before they can do their damage.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, just as hackers exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, you can thwart zero-day vulnerabilities with strong antivirus. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Protecting yourself from zero-day threats</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Today, McAfee registers an average of 1.1 million new malicious programs and potentially unwanted apps (PUA) each day, which makes zero-day protection an absolute boon for anyone who goes online—and </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fen-us%2Fidentity-theft%2Fprotection.html%3Fpath%3Dblogs%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">online protection like ours offers some of the strongest antivirus protection you can get</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, as recognized by </span><a href=\"https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Fblogs%2Fmcafee-news%2Fmcafee-awarded-best-protection-by-the-labs-at-av-test%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">independent third-party labs</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Online protection software does a few other things for you as well when it comes to malware attacks:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It alerts you of suspicious links in emails, texts, and direct messages before you click or tap on them, which can prevent bad actors from infecting your device with malware. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It can also alert you of dangerous websites while you surf, once more steering you clear of phishing websites and other sites that host malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"3\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And it includes a firewall, which can protect your network and the devices on them from attack by filtering both incoming and outgoing traffic.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Beyond using online protection software with strong antivirus, you can take a few more steps that will keep you safer still:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1. Update your browser, operating system, and applications</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> In addition to often providing new features and functionality, updates fix the vulnerabilities in your apps and operating systems, which strengthens your protection against malware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2. Uninstall old apps</span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The more software you have, the more potential vulnerabilities you have. By uninstalling old apps, you leave hackers with fewer avenues of attack. Take a look at your computers and smartphones. Delete the old apps you no longer use, along with any accounts and data associated with them as well. Another benefit is that this can potentially reduce your risk if the companies behind those apps get hit by a data breach.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3. Don’t click on links in emails, texts, and direct messages </span></b></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This is a good rule of thumb in general, but it can definitely help you protect against zero-day attacks. The same holds true for email attachments. Never open them from unknown senders. And if you receive one from a friend, family member, or co-worker, take a quick second to confirm that they sent it. Some attackers masquerade as people we know, and in some cases hack their accounts so they can spread malware in their name.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Zero-day threats call for zero-day protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As the number of apps and devices on the internet have seen explosive growth in recent years, so has the volume of malware—much of it zero-day threats that take advantage of newly discovered vulnerabilities. Hidden within millions and millions of lines of code, dependencies, and interactions, zero-day threats will remain the rule, rather than the exception.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, antivirus technology has more than kept up, particularly by leaning on smart technologies that can detect zero-day threats before they become known threats. Using strong antivirus, as part of online protection software that contains even more security features still, remains an absolute best practice for anyone who spends any kind of time online.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-a-zero-day-threat/\">What is a Zero-Day Threat?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"Your Guide to Ransomware—and Preventing It Too","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/your-guide-to-ransomware-and-preventing-it-too/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"McAfee"},"pubDate":"Sun, 09 Apr 2023 10:18:26 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Internet Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Privacy & Identity Protection"},{"#cdata-section":"Guide to Ransomware"},{"#cdata-section":"Ransomware guide"},{"#cdata-section":"Preventing ransomware"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=163081"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_011023-1-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Ransomware.

Even the name sounds scary.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">When you get down to it, ransomware is one of the nastiest attacks a hacker can wage. They target some of our most important and precious things—our files, our photos, and the information stored on our devices. Think about suddenly losing access to all of them and being forced to pay a ransom to get access back. Worse yet, paying the ransom is no guarantee the hacker will return them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That’s what a ransomware attack does. Broadly speaking, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">it’s a type of malware that infects a network or a device and then typically encrypts the files, data, and apps stored on it, digitally scrambling them so the proper owners can’t access them. Only a digital key can unlock them—one that the hacker holds.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Nasty for sure, yet you can take several steps that can greatly reduce the risk of it happening to you. Our recently published Ransomware Security Guide breaks them down for you, and in this blog we’ll look at a few reasons why ransomware protection is so vital.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How bad is ransomware, really?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The short answer is pretty bad—to the tune of </span><a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">billions of dollars stolen from victims each year</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. Ransomware targets people and their families just as explained above. Yet it also targets large organizations, governments, and even companies that run critical stretches of energy infrastructure and the food supply chain. Accordingly, the ransom amounts for these victims climb into millions of dollars. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A few recent cases of large-scale ransomware attacks include: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">JBS Foods, May 2021 –</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Organized ransomware attackers targeted JBS’s North American and Australian meat processing plants, which disrupted the distribution of food to supermarkets and restaurants.

The pipeline operator said they paid nearly $4.5 million to the hackers responsible, some of which was recovered by U.S. law enforcement. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Kaseya, July 2021 –</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> As many as 1,500 companies had their data encrypted by a ransomware attack that followed an initial ransomware attack on Kaseya, a company that provides IT solutions to other companies. Once the ransomware infiltrated Kaseya’s systems, it quickly spread to Kaseya’s customers. Rather than pay the ransom, Kaseya’ co-operated with U.S. federal law enforcement and soon obtained a decryption key that could restore any data encrypted in the attack. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Who’s behind such attacks? Given the scope and scale of them, it’s often organized hacking groups. Put simply, these are big heists. It demands expertise to pull them off, not to mention further expertise to transfer large sums of cryptocurrency in ways that cover the hackers’ tracks. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As for ransomware attacks on people and their families, the individual dollar amounts of an attack are far lower, typically in the hundreds of dollars. Again, the culprits behind them may be large hacking groups that cast a wider net for individual victims, where hundreds of successful attacks at hundreds of dollars each quickly add up. One example: a hacker group that posed as a government agency and as a major retailer, which </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/politics/fbi-usb-hackers-warning/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">mailed out thousands of USB drives infected with malware</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Other ransomware hackers who target people and families are far less sophisticated. Small-time hackers and hacking groups can find the tools they need to conduct such attacks by shopping on the dark web, where ransomware is available for sale or for lease as a service (Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS). In effect, near-amateur hackers can grab a ready-to-deploy attack right off the shelf.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Taken together, hackers will level a ransomware attack at practically anyone or any organization—making it everyone’s concern.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How does ransomware end up on computers and phones?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hackers have several ways of getting ransomware onto one of your devices. Like any other type of malware, it can infect your device via a phishing link or a bogus attachment. It can also end up there by downloading apps from questionable app stores, with a stolen or hacked password, or through an outdated device or network router with poor security measures in place. And as mentioned above, infected storage devices provide another avenue.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social engineering attacks enter the mix as well, where </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">the hacker poses as someone the victim knows and gets the victim to either download malware or provide the hacker access to an otherwise password-protected device, app, or network.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And yes, ransomware can end up on smartphones as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">While not a prevalent as other types of malware attacks, smartphone ransomware can </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">encrypt files, photos, and the like on a smartphone, just as it can on computers and networks. Yet other forms of mobile ransomware don’t have to encrypt data to make the phone unusable. The “Lockerpin” ransomware that has struck some Android devices in the past would change the PIN number that locked the phone. Other forms of mobile ransomware paste a window over the phone’s apps, making them unusable without decrypting the ransomware.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Avoiding ransomware in the first place</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Part of avoiding ransomware involves reducing human error—keeping a watchful eye open for those spammy links, malicious downloads, bogus emails, and basically keeping your apps and devices up to date so that they have the latest security measures in place. The remainder relies on a good dose of prevention. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our Ransomware Security Guide provides a checklist for both.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It gets into the details of </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">what ransomware looks like and how it works, followed by the straightforward things you can do to prevent it, along with the steps to take if the unfortunate ends up happening to you or someone you know.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ransomware is one of the nastiest attacks going because it targets our files, photos, and information, things we don’t know where we’d be without. Yet it’s good to know you can indeed lower your risk with a few relatively simple steps. Once you have them in place, chances are a good feeling will come over you, the one that comes with knowing you’ve protected what’s precious and important to you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/your-guide-to-ransomware-and-preventing-it-too/\">Your Guide to Ransomware—and Preventing It Too</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}},{"title":"What Parents Need To Know About TikTok’s New Screen Time Limits","link":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-parents-need-to-know-about-tiktoks-new-screen-time-limits/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Alex Merton-McCann"},"pubDate":"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 18:59:00 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Family Safety"},{"#cdata-section":"children's privacy on TikTok"},{"#cdata-section":"tiktok screen time limit"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/?p=167576"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<div><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523-194x129.png 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></div>\n<p>Social media platforms often get a hard time by us parents.

How good?? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">I hear what you’re thinking – maybe we can cross TikTok off our list of social media platforms that we need to get our head around? But no, my friends – not so fast! Tik Tok’s new screen time limits are all about parental involvement – which is why I am a fan! So, buckle-up because if you have an under 18 on TikTok (and you’re committed to their digital well-being) then my prediction is that you’ll soon know more about this social media platform than you even thought was possible! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">How Do The New Screen Time Limits Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Over the coming weeks, every account that belongs to an under 18-year-old will automatically be set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit. Once they’ve clocked up an hour of scrolling, teens will be asked to enter a passcode, which TikTok will supply, to keep using the platform. TikTok refers to this as an ‘active decision’. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, clearly this isn’t quite the silver bullet to all your screen time worries as teens can choose to opt out of the 60-minute limits. But if they do choose to opt out and then spend more than 100 minutes a day on the platform, they will be prompted to set a daily screen time limit. ‘Will that actually do anything?’ &#8211; I hear you say. Well, in the first month of testing this approach, TikTok found that this strategy resulted in a 234% increase in the use of its screen time management tools – a move in the right direction!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">But Wait, There’s More…</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But here’s the part I love the most: TikTok offers Family Pairing which allows you to link your child’s account to yours. And as soon as you enable Family Pairing, your teen is no longer in control of their own screen time. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Now, don’t get me wrong – I am not a fan of the authoritarian approach when it comes to all things tech. I do prefer a consultative ‘let’s work together’ vibe. However, TikTok’s move to involve parents in making decisions about their child’s screen time means that families will need to talk digital wellbeing more than ever before and here’s why&#8230;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Within the Family Pairings settings, parents are able to set screen time limits based on the day of the week which means homework and holidays can be worked around. There is also a dashboard that shows your child’s screen time usage, the number of times the app was opened plus a breakdown of time spent during the day and night. Now, with all this control and information, you’ll be in quite the powerful position so be prepared to be sold hard by your teen on many the benefits of TikTok! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Maybe It’s Time for A Family Digital Contract?</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For years I have been a fan of creating a Family Digital Contract which means you get to outline your family’s expectations around technology use. Now the agreement can include time spent online, the sites that can be visited and even the behaviour you expect of your child when they are online. So, if your kids are avid TikTok users then I highly recommend you do this ASAP.

And that’s OK if they understand why their actions weren’t ideal and you have a suitable level of confidence that they will get back on track. However, if you have concerns that they need an additional level of structure to ensure their digital wellbeing remains intact then that’s when TikTok’s Family Pairing can work a treat!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">It&#8217;s no secret that social media can be incredibly captivating, possibly even addicting, for so many. And it’s not just TikTok – Instagram, Facebook even Twitter has all been designed to give us regular hits of dopamine with each scroll, like and post. And while I know that parental controls are only one part of the solution, they can be very handy if you need to bring your tween’s usage under control.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remember, Conversations Are King!</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But when all is said and done, please remember that the strength of your relationship with your child is the best way of keeping them safe online and their wellbeing intact. If your kids know that they can come to you about any issue at all – and that you will always have their back – then you’re winning!! </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, be interested in their life – both online and offline – ask questions – who do they hang with? How do they spend their time? And remember to share your online experience with them too – get yourself a little ‘tech’ cred – because I promise they will be more likely to come to you when there is a problem.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">‘Till next time – keep talking!!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Alex </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/what-parents-need-to-know-about-tiktoks-new-screen-time-limits/\">What Parents Need To Know About TikTok’s New Screen Time Limits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/blogs\">McAfee Blog</a>.</p>\n"}}]}}}
