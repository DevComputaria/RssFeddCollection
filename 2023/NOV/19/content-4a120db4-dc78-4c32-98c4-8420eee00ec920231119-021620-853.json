showed the soldiers returning fire at Hamas terrorists who fired multiple rounds of RPGs at them in Zeitoun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others showed tanks rolling through the ruined streets as they blasted unseen enemies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel continues to step up its offensive operations as it seeks to destroy Hamas and rescue captured hostages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the humanitarian situation in the narrow strip is continuing to worsen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, the IDF said its Southern Command “continues expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods” and is working to “target terrorists and strike Hamas infrastructure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Additional troops are operating on the outskirts of Zeitoun, including Sheikh Ijlin and Rimal, clearing the areas from terrorists and striking terror infrastructure,&#8221; it added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, another division of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/israel/\">Israeli</a> troops is currently operating on the outskirts of Jabaliya &#8211; where some 1.6 million Gazans have been displaced since October 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both areas house multiple command and control centres of Hamas &#8211; and are among the most significant terror strongholds, according to Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several Hamas operatives “intentionally operate from within civilian areas,&#8221; and attempt to attack the troops using anti-tank missiles and explosive devices, it has been reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as hundreds of civilians and health workers fled Al-Shifa,&nbsp;Gaza&#8217;s largest hospital on foot today after Israeli&nbsp;troops issued the order to evacuate the place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health officials in Gaza have said that &#8220;many&#8221; patients, medical staff and displaced people have now left the hospital &#8211; after conflicting reports this morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al-Shifa hospital has become the new focus of the Israel-Hamas war as&nbsp;Israel&nbsp;claims it is a façade for a&nbsp;Hamas&nbsp;stronghold &#8211; something the Hamas have repeatedly denied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli troops claimed on Wednesday they had found weapons in the hospital &#8211; evidence, they say, to support their claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Israel said it had blown up a bomb factory used by a terrorist group in Gaza. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF released <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24778906/israel-terrorist-bomb-gaza-hamas-tunnels/\">shocking footage showing the enormous explosion</a> tearing through a built-up area in the Strip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF officials said the site was used by the extremist group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) &#8211; a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/terrorism/\">terrorist</a>&nbsp;organisation based in Gaza which is distinct from&nbsp;Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the&nbsp;Israeli&nbsp;military, the post was a &#8220;major asset for weapon production&#8221; for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorist group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli troops found two trucks full of weapons, including highly destructive rocket parts, UAVs, and other intelligence material that belonged to PIJ, it was reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some 30,000 marchers &#8211; family members of those missing and held hostage in Gaza &#8211; marched from Tel Aviv to reach the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem on Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon entering the capital city, marchers were greeted by residents of the city holding yellow balloons printed with the words “Bring them home.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as Palestinian civilians have been left fleeing for their lives as Israel attempts to destroy Hamas after the terror group&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24612569/archive-footage-released-haunting-hamas-israel-attacks/\">massacred 1,200 civilians on October 7</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Families living in Gaza have been caught in the brutal crossfire, with regular accusations that the terrorists are attempting to use them as “human shields”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the northern part of the strip has been turned into a devastated warzone &#8211; with ruined buildings, dwindling supplies and horrific suffering for Gaza’s people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to The Red Cross, some 1.5 million civilians have been forced to flee south amid the Israeli onslaught from land, air and sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figures for the death toll remain unverified &#8211; but Hamas’ health officials claim more than 11,000 civilians, including more than 4,500 children have been killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel disputes these figures &#8211; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US</a>&nbsp;President&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;said he had “no confidence” in

casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the deaths, however, must be blamed on Hamas &#8211; not Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as the horror continues there have been growing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24781667\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"

there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many illustrious names, including &nbsp;Fausto Coppi, Monica Vitti, Willy Brandt and have been here to enjoy some freshly caught trout fish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, the structure has expanded, thus transforming itself from a restaurant to a hotel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, the name has remained the one it was originally given, to carry with it the roots and history that characterize this unique place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the owners, the story of this iconic site dates back to around 1600 &#8211; and they claim to have paper documents dated 1830 which attest to its presence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Francesca&#8217;s family became owners of the structure, passing down the management and all the responsibilities from generation to generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now she and her husband, after years of bureaucratic challenges, have received the license to renovate this place and start it again in full blow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more than two decades, the restaurant-turned-hotel was left to rot, but the couple overseeing renovation work have great plans to blow life into the beautiful coastal site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intentions are to turn it into a &#8220;hotel tourist residence&#8221; &#8211; with housing units, accommodation, rooms and a restaurant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, another luxurious high-rise hotel that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24767335/abandoned-430-room-luxury-resort-18-hole-golf/\">dates back to the early 20th century</a> has been left to rot after owners failed to pay taxes worth millions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Established in 1901 by famous hotelier Charles Slutsky, the Nevele Grande is situated in the picturesque Catskills region in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york/\">New York</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surrounded by two lakes in a valley west of the Shawangunk Mountains, the extravagant property grew over time to become a vacation home for the super-rich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nevele Grande Resort lived up to its grandiose name &#8211; at its peak, it had 430 guest rooms and employed a staff of 800.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within two decades, the resort was extended with new wings and a lot of other lavish features exclusively available for the visiting guests.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24781041\" class=\"wp-caption

former Welsh Guard’s captain was rugby tackled by two men close to the King’s Blockhouse on Devil’s Peak built in 1796 and though outnumbered fought back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He managed to grab back his snatched mobile phone and sent the larger man packing but the smaller mugger pulled a machete and a kitchen knife from a backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elite athlete Tom &#8211; sponsored by Red Bull and Adidas &#8211; said: “Once the knife was at my throat they made it very clear they would kill me if I carried on fighting so I stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They got my <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and then took my Garmin watch both worth about £2500 then went through my back pack pulling everything out asking how much things were worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Then they spotted my wedding ring and said if I didn’t take it off they would cut if off.&nbsp; I have just celebrated my 1st wedding anniversary and I asked them to not take it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The knife was pushed in harder and I thought Sophie would rather have me back in one piece than the ring so I took it off and gave it to them which was so very hard to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They told me not to follow and ran off and I headed back down off the contour path and down towards Rhodes Memorial and the university to report what happened” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The South African National Park Rangers searched the area along with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/\">police</a> but could find no trace of the pair who attacked as Tom was out on a 40km mountain training run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom was one of the star runners who had top <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/celebrity/\">celebrity</a> billing for those competing in the RMB Ultra Trail Cape Town 100km <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/race/\">race</a> and was hot favourite to win the tough event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the mountain ordeal has traumatised the elite athlete so much he no longer feels safe to continue his training programme and is flying home on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/british-airways/\">British Airways</a> tonight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom of Loughborough, Leics, said: “I’ve spoken it over with Sophie and it makes sense that if I can’t get myself in the right frame of mind physically or mentally to fly home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have travelled all over Africa and had great experiences but this is my first time in South Africa and in Cape Town and it is very sad that I have been forced to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But what happened was very traumatic with two men with a machete and kitchen knife threatening to kill me and that will sadly be my memory of my first visit over here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Will I come back?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always wanted to do the Cape Town ultra-trail as it is one of the toughest in the world and I hope in the future I will catch a plane back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But it is not fair on Sophie to go back up on that mountain to train each day and if I can’t train then I can’t do myself justice in the race so I have no option but to pack my bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I only got here on Tuesday so it has been short but sadly not-so-sweet” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fellow runner found traumatised Tom and guided him back down the mountain and reported the attack which is one of a string of muggings on trail runners and hikers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had flown into Cape Town International Airport on Tuesday a British doctor was shot dead at a nearby township in August and an American tourist was shot in the mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom was running alone on a rugged trail in preparation for the rugged 100km RMB Ultra Trail in Cape Town next Friday which takes athletes up and down numerous mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day Tom was mugged the Minister of Police Bheki Cele revealed the latest <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/\">crime</a> figures which showed 76 murders and 115 rapes a day took place a day in the last 3 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Government officials however insist most crime takes place in the townships and poor areas and involve gang turf wars and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/drugs/\">drugs</a> and that attacks on tourists are rare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British doctor Kar Hao Tech, 40, shot dead and US tourist Walter Fischel, 55, shot in the face had both been taken by their Sat-Nav’s into a dangerous airport township.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most tourists who are victims of crime mistakenly wander alone into known danger spots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Table Mountain park ranger said: “This trail runner unfortunately was attacked by opportunist muggers but he broke the golden rule to go on the mountain alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We cannot stress enough that runners and hikers should enjoy the mountain but in groups as if alone you are a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/target/\">target</a> for muggers or helpless if you have a fall”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crime situation was not helped in August when the ANC Government ordered the early release of 15,000 men from overcrowded prisons to house more criminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sharp spike in knife and gun muggings in tourist areas has been reported since the mass release and Cape Town police are organising extra patrols for the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/summer/\">summer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former soldier married international triathlete Sophie Coldwell, 28, in November last year and they celebrated their 1st wedding anniversary on the 12th of this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year Tom has won the 100 mile USA Western States Endurance Run and the 33 mile Ultra Trail in Snowdonia and was 2nd in the USA Black Canyon Ultra 60 mile race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has run for Great Britain cross country and trail running team and is training for the next Olympics and had hoped to celebrate Xmas by winning the Cape Town ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom changed careers after taking part in the world&#8217;s toughest race the 251km desert ultra Marathon des Sables and came third and left the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/british-army/\">British army</a> to become an athlete.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24780819\" class=\"wp-caption

is a tricky challenge designed as a brain teaser for both adults and children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to solve the puzzle by picking out the dice that rightly completes the set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not an easy task though &#8211; the intricacies of this puzzle have left many people scratching their heads.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you focus hard with all your attention and think like a genius, you should be able to solve this challenging brain teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, before you start, can you<a

seconds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only those with impeccable vision and a sharp mind can spot them all out &#8211; and a genius would be able to solve it in under 10 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, you could be

your head trying to pick the right dice, here is what you need to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Observe the image carefully and take a mental note of each of the dice in the arrangement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer to this challenge lies in a pattern in the image &#8211; all you have to do is find it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon taking a deeper look, you will see the first two rows have two red dice and one blue die each &#8211; and the third row has just one red die and one blue die. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the solution has to be a red die as it will complete the colour pattern. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the challenge does not end here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three red dice in the options to choose from &#8211; so which one is correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, you need to find a pattern to figure out the right solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you observe carefully, you will see the first two rows has three number on the dice &#8211; five, three, and two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the last row, the die with the number three is missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So option D, which is a red die with the number three on it, completes the pattern &#8211;  and is the solution to its brain teaser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you managed to solve this puzzle in less than a minute &#8211; give yourself a pat on the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you solved it in less than 18 seconds &#8211; congratulations to you as you have just been certified as a genius!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try your luck at another optical illusion, then have a go at&nbsp;<a

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24618003/madeleine-mccann-christian-b-prove-case-collapsing/\">race against time</a> in linking the convicted paedophile to Maddie’s disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source close to the case said: &#8220;German detectives remain convinced Christian B was involved in Maddie’s disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But they still have a very confused timeline of Christian B’s life spent on Praia De Luz. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For years he is thought to have been drifting around the island living in a van and they want to understand more about what he was doing during this time and who he was seeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The big problem they have is that relations with Portuguese cops are at an all-time low.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They added: &#8220;Hardly any intelligence is now being shared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This has therefore left German cops with little choice but to work backwards and to try and trace as many friends, colleagues, former girlfriends and lovers of Christian B as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They might hold vital clues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Cops remain sure someone, somewhere, knows information which could be of vital importance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former partners of Christian B have come forward before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago Nuray Oezgen <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16054996/ex-christian-b-campervan-madeleine-mccann/\">told how she met Christian B</a> while working in a bar in Hanover in 2012 and they eventually rented a place together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just months into their relationship, she says he became aggressive and would drink beer and Jagermeister with pals while she worked alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nuray later said the relationship soured when Christian B began showing an unhealthy obsession with schoolgirls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final straw came when Nuray discovered Christian B was in a sexual relationship with a local teen he brought back to their flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police later <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12276091/video-christian-b-vw-camper-madeleine-mccann/\">raided his home in Braunschweig</a> where they discovered a secret stash of hundreds of sickening child abuse images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was found to have sexually abused a friend&#8217;s five-year-old daughter but, by then, he had already fled to Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An arrest warrant was issued and he eventually confessed to the sickening crimes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was extradited back to Germany in 2016 and jailed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source close to the current probe into Christian B says his “wayward” and “hedonistic” lifestyle remain of huge interest to officers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The source said: “Christian B lived a very strange life in Germany and later in Praia De Luz. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He used a lot of drugs and travelled around meeting women, many of whom went off with him consensually. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So there’s a web of former partners and lovers who could hold really critical information about what he was getting up to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Officers desperately need new leads.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, we exclusively revealed how cops leading the probe into Christian B may have “just weeks” to save their investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The

from&nbsp;Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She died after visiting a stadium in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/rio-de-janeiro/\">Rio de Janeiro</a> to attend a Taylor concert on Friday, November 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swift had arrived in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-america/\">South America</a> earlier in November for the accompanying leg of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/22755639/taylor-swift-eras-tour-uk-tickets-updates/\">her epic Eras tour</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happened to Ana Clara Benevides?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, it has been reported that a member of Ana Clara&#8217;s family <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/24778937/taylor-swift-fan-ana-clara-benevides-dies-brazil/\">has confirmed her death</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Brazilian publication <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2023/11/fa-de-taylor-swift-morre-apos-passar-mal-durante-show-no-rio-de-janeiro.shtml\">Folha de Sao Paulo</a>, Ana&#8217;s cousin Estela Benevides received the awful news from doctors over the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ana Clara is reported to have died of cardiorespiratory arrest after fainting at Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Nilton Santos Stadium ahead of Taylor&#8217;s gig there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her friend, Thiago Fernandes, told press that Ana Clara was revived after fainting at the stadium but had a second arrest on the way to the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hospital/\">hospital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Temperatures in Rio de Janeiro were recorded as high as 100F, approximately 37C, on the day of Taylor&#8217;s concert, leading to a local heat warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has also been reported that the stadium reached a thermal sensation of 60C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefighters unofficially recorded 1,000 fainting spells during the November 17 show by the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/22468383/taylor-swift-midnights-till-the-dawn-release/\">Midnights</a> star.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans were reportedly banned from bringing water bottles into the stadium for Swift&#8217;s gig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many concert-goers complained on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/\">social media</a> about the ban, suggesting they should be permitted to bring them in due to the high temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage released from the event <a

Kelce</a>, was also seen handing out bottles to the crowd herself after her hearing her fans chant for water.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What has Taylor Swift said about her fan&#8217;s death?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after her November 17 show, Taylor shared a handwritten note on her <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/Instagram/\">Instagram</a> story addressing Ana Clara&#8217;s death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The message read: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t even tell you how devastated I am by this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor continued: &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concert where Ana Clara first fainted was the first of Taylor&#8217;s three scheduled shows in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final stop of the South American leg of the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13444755/taylor-swift-launches-shock-album-evermore/\">Evermore</a> star&#8217;s tour is scheduled for the end of November in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sao-paulo/\">Sao Paulo</a>, Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swift will then travel to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/\">Europe</a> in

</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of a sudden, a People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) destroyer &nbsp;DDG-139 approached, despite communications with Toowoomba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It prompted the Aussie crew to reiterate a dive was underway and ask for the Chinese warship to stay clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the Chinese troops acknowledging the message, they came even closer and activated their hull-mounted sonar at full blast, risking the lives of the Australian Navy divers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They suffered minor injuries that were likely caused by the sonar, it was found later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Marles, Deputy Prime Minister of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/\">Australia</a> and Minister of Defence, slammed the PLA-N ship’s manoeuvre as “unsafe and

to America&#8217; has been circulating on the app[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Experts told The Sun Online the site needs to do more to tackle hateful content &#8211; and warned it is being used by &#8220;sinister actors&#8221; to stoke up division and hate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They demanded the company ensure its algorithm is not feeding up hateful content to young, impressionable users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they warned of potentially dangerous real-world consequences if more action is not taken by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/\">TikTok</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Anthony Glees, a security expert from the University of Buckingham, told The Sun Online: &#8220;Everybody knows that TikTok appeals especially to young minds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s not only what&#8217;s going on right now, it&#8217;s planting those seeds in impressionable young [people].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They grow into something in the years to come.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of policy think tank Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun: &#8220;TikTok has a long history of allowing hatred to be promoted on its platform, and does little to censor hate speech of this kind.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app has always insisted it works proactively in tackling hate speech, and in a statement told The Sun they are committed to &#8220;doing our part&#8221; to defeat anti-Semitism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TikTok has been blasted this week after a sick letter written by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24754969/tiktok-osama-bin-laden-israel-gaza-hamas-war/\">Osama bin Laden justifying the 9/11 attacks was allowed to go viral</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was viewed millions of times before being <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24766874/tiktok-delete-influencers-osama-bin-laden-israel-gaza/\">finally stopped and users banned.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it was revealed top actor Sacha Baron Cohen led a chorus of Jewish celebrity voices in calling for the company to do more on anti-Semitism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baron Cohen fired a fierce shot across the tech company&#8217;s bow as he met with them &#8211; accusing them of &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24770124/sacha-baron-cohen-tiktok-celebrities-antisemitism-israel-hamas-war/\">creating the biggest anti-Semitic movement since the Nazis</a>&#8220;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And meanwhile, TikTok user Gidon Lev &#8211; an 88-year-old holocaust survivor who used his account with 459k followers to warn about anti-Semitism &#8211; says he has been driven off the app by hate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Glees warned the level of hate being spread on the app is a &#8220;very serious&#8221; threat and warned it is being manipulated for &#8220;political reasons&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said hate speech &#8211; many examples of which were highlighted by Baron Cohen and the other celebs in the call with TikTok &#8211; &#8220;play directly into the history of the last century&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expert explained: &#8220;These old tropes, which were never dead, are being reawakened by sinister manipulators on TikTok.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media, Glees says, is a major factor in the spread of anti-Semitism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while he thinks platforms like TikTok &#8211; but also Instagram and Facebook &#8211; have good rules, they &#8220;don&#8217;t practice them&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Rich, head of policy at Community Security Trust, spoke to The Sun about his work in the charity&#8217;s efforts to monitor anti-Semitism online and offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claimed that teenagers on the app are &#8220;seeing stuff to do with Jews or Israel, recommended by the algorithm, that&#8217;s anti-Semitic&#8221;, coming up on their For You page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave said the sick trend where users discuss bin Laden&#8217;s letter, which is full of &#8220;very anti-Semitic content&#8221;, is concerning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he worries this might even have made young people think the terrorist leader is &#8220;someone worth listening to&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich said that if TikTok bosses are &#8220;not aware&#8221; of the extent of anti-Semitism on the app, &#8220;then frankly that&#8217;s a disgrace&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoe Cairns, a social media expert, said the huge influx of content on an app like TikTok makes it tricky to monitor everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until TikTok&#8217;s got something set up to filter these comments and actions are put in place to stop that from happening, the app is going to keep allowing that content to come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If that content doesn&#8217;t get flagged and doesn&#8217;t get the engagement that&#8217;s required, what will happen is that will be lost amongst all the other noise that&#8217;s going on,&#8221; she told The Sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Cairns did say the more people who report it, the easier it is for the company to take action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As celebrities and individuals, what we can do from our end is that we need to make sure that we report it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The more people that report it, the better then that it will be picked up by TikTok to do something about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TikTok is owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance Ltd &#8211; and has long-faced scrutiny over its possible links to the Communist regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is banned on government phones in the UK due to security and spying fears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is currently a call for a national ban in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley reiterated the demand for the ban following the Bin Laden letter&#8217;s spread on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a prime example of how our foreign enemies poison social media to advance their evil agenda,&#8221; she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TikTok has regularly and strongly denied any links to the Chinese Communist Party. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Mendoza said he believes the app should be &#8220;restricted&#8221; in the West pending further investigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure

influential and provocative content to young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And raged that TikTok &#8220;is creating the biggest anti-Semitic movement since the Nazis&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head of TikTok operations Adam Presser and global head of user operations Seth Melnick wanted to hear specifics about the experiences of those on the call in hopes of improving the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baron Cohen highlighted the circulation of violent images on the platform and said that TikTok has the power to &#8220;flip a switch&#8221; in tackling anti-Semitism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Presser claimed there

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/terrorism/\">terrorist</a> organisation based in Gaza which is distinct from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF said it conducted the huge blast on Thursday following an intense operation that lasted 12 hours &#8211; and shared a video claiming to show the moment of the explosion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/israel/\">Israeli</a> military, the post was a &#8220;major asset for weapon production&#8221; for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorist group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli troops found two trucks full of weapons, including highly destructive rocket parts, UAVs, and other intelligence material that belonged to PIJ, it was reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF wrote in a statement: &#8220;Our troops searched the post and removed two trucks full of weapons, including Badr-3 rocket parts (a surface-to-surface rocket), UAV parts, and intelligence materials belonging to the PIJ.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1979, the PIJ is the second-largest terrorist group in Gaza after Hamas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Counter Extremism Project the group is &#8220;dedicated to eradicating Israel&#8221; and &#8220;establishing an autonomous Islamic Palestinian state&#8221; in the lands currently comprising Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after the Israeli military said it had located more &#8220;Hamas terror tunnels&#8221; and had found information about the hostages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF spokesman R.-Adm Daniel Hagari said on Friday: &#8220;We have located underground infrastructure and information about the hostages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are determined to move forward, destroy and kill terrorists, and dismantle the military infrastructure of&nbsp;Hamas.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a new dramatic video shows Israel Defence Forces (IDF) commandos&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24768019/israeli-commandos-gunfight-hamas-hotel/\">raiding a ruined hotel</a> while hunting down Hamas terrorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soldiers can be seen combing through the site while wielding guns as they attempt to snare Hamas brutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF also unleashed a tank &#8211; using it to blast at buildings as troops stormed the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as Palestinian civilians have been left fleeing for their lives as Israel attempts to destroy Hamas after the terror group <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24612569/archive-footage-released-haunting-hamas-israel-attacks/\">massacred 1,200 civilians on October 7</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Families living in Gaza have been caught in the brutal crossfire, with regular accusations that the terrorists are attempting to use them as “human shields”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the northern part of the strip has been turned into a devastated warzone &#8211; with ruined buildings, dwindling supplies and horrific suffering for Gaza’s people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to The Red Cross, some 1.5 million civilians have been forced to flee south amid the Israeli onslaught from land, air and sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figures for the death toll remain unverified &#8211; but Hamas’ health officials claim more than 11,000 civilians, including more than 4,500 children have been killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel disputes these figures &#8211; and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US</a> President <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a> said he had “no confidence” in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/binyamin-netanyahu/\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> admitted Israel has &#8220;not been successful&#8221; in reducing civilian casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the deaths, however, must be blamed on Hamas &#8211; not

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24645624/worlds-worst-crocodile-attacks-massacre-500-dead/\">crocodiles </a>and chests full of diamonds were found after the leaders lost power and were sent packing from the places they had built from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the palaces serve as a constant reminder of the greed, corruption and brutality of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/africa/\">Africa</a> during the mid to late twentieth century and the money wasted across various leadership reigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the deepest depths of northern <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/\">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) sits a tiny inhabited village of Kawele slowly falling apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a bustling place where rulers ruled and servants served, Kawele has become a derelict area of muddied buildings and a sad former memory of how the village was formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notorious dictator Mobutu Sese Seko ruled over the DRC, then known as Zaire, for 32 years up until the late 90’s and made Kawele his kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobutu’s palace has now lost its roof leaving only a flimsy, unusable structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swimming pool is empty, covered in filth with cracks all along its sides as overgrown weeds and smashed up pottery and glassware sit scattered around the grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobutu had his servants create two lavish palaces for him &#8211; one for hosting guests and friends and a private house in Kawele.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These infamous buildings were built from the finest <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/\">Italian </a>marble with antique <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/\">French </a>furniture, Venetian chandeliers and expensive artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A booming <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/\">Europe </a>was transferred over to the dark depths of the African jungle as international chefs, Parisian pastries, and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/belgium/\">Belgian </a>mussels were all flown in from the grandest spots available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A runway was big enough to house Mobutu’s private plane &#8211; a Concorde &#8211; which the leader would take to and from France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day, unhappy servants carried buckets filled with champagne and luxurious platters of salmon to their rulers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cellars were constantly bursting with the pretty pink champagne and elite vintage wines as 1,000 uniformed staff kept the palaces in perfect conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>French presidents, controversial figures, businessmen and even Pope John Paul II came to live the life of a king in the village.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Congolese politician estimated that Mobutu spent up to £250m on the pair of palaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the palaces, Mobutu built a luxury hotel to keep his fellow rich and wealthy friends happy, multiple flashy shops and business’ and even a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coca-cola/\">Coca Cola</a> factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These shops were set up as the town began to become a thriving social hub as the Zairean economy, outside of the village, began to tumble down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Mobutu was dying of cancer the town’s health dropped just as devastatingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former tyrant leader was driven out of Zaire in 1997 and into Morocco by ruler of the rebellion Laurent Désiré Kabila as the DRC was formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobutu leaving also meant the money in the villages dried up and the businesses started to make their way out – leaving the place a ghost town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endless looting caused the village to look like a warzone and a plethora of half-finished projects left machinery and buildings rotting as it created an eyesore over a once beautiful town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broken down cars sit covered in rust with popped tires and smashed windows as the destroyed roads are littered in potholes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hotel – Motel Nzekele – still sits tall over the village but in a depressing state near unfixable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cinema sits broken and battered from the projector to the seats and the hotels once luxury pool has lost its water and is now just a murky green pit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hydroelectric plant to supply constant electricity to the villages is now derelict and pointless and the Coca Cola factory built up alongside banks and other vital businesses are now empty shells of places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One slight shining light is two unfinished building blocks have been turned into classrooms for young children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wooden desks and old-fashioned chalkboards sit on the bottom floor of two giant stone buildings that were built as the headquarters for the town’s water ministry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24732170\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"

was used by a pope, presidents and wealthy businessmen to serve them drinks now just collects dust rather than serve alcohol[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>A second blood-thirsty tyrant was Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa who took over Central African Republic across the border at the same time as Mobutu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leader stole power by killing and scaring people into submission so he got what he wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1977, he caused what many view as Africa&#8217;s most megalomaniacal post-colonial event as he ascended to a fully golden eagle throne donning a gold starry outfit with a golden crown bedazzled in diamonds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His coronation cost a whopping £14million as the new leader made sure his grand event had more than 25,000 bottles of champagne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years after, Bokassa was reportedly the main man behind the torturing and killing or school kids who were protesting over his reign and this led to his capture being imminent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bokassa built up his own town in a place called Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bokassa owned two palaces within his huge collection of properties that had shocking finds inside them after French Police searched his properties after he became the main target of international police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After voluntarily handing himself in for his heinous crimes cops found a range of horror finds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Villa Kolongo and Villa Berengo were eerily found with mutilated corpses in freezers, bones of dead victims that had been spat out by his pet crocodiles and mountains of horror pornography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that sat alongside chests, brimming with diamonds and lost treasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangui was built up by Bokassa as he set about making factories housing cocoa and coffee, a private airport, apartments for his advisers and housing for his 1,000 men guarding the place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, unarmed guards stand nonchalantly at the village gates and around the giant statue of the town’s founder Bokassa as the buildings they protect sit overgrown with greenery and laced with graffiti.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both towns once ruled by conman Mobutu and killer tyrant Bokassa, photos are scarce and uncommon as the guards try to keep the towns under wraps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The military check cameras when you leave and one of the palaces – used by Mobutu for his own pleasure – hasn’t been seen for almost two decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whopping&nbsp;<a

left to crumble before it was even completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sad <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24718615/abandoned-palace-italy-ballroom-statues/\">palace on the Italian coastline</a> was also left to rot and crumble away a century after it was built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once bustling with the world’s elites dancing in its dazzling ballroom, surrounded by luxury chandeliers and pricey marble

Beatles[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Davis &#8211; who was <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24727071/muslim-convert-isis-beatles-death-squad-jailed/\">jailed this week for eight years</a> on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/terrorism/\">terrorism</a> charges &#8211; is linked to the ISIS death squad dubbed <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/the-beatles/\">The Beatles</a> due to their British accents, with Davis suspected of being &#8220;Paul&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is one of the highest-profile terror Brits to return from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/syria/\">Syria</a> &#8211; but has always denied being connected with&nbsp;The Beatles&nbsp;cell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, ISIS militants launched a brutal attack on the Yazidi people &#8211; a religious and ethnic minority in northern <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iraq/\">Iraq</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were subjected to genocide, with an estimated 5,000 murdered and more than 10,000 kidnapped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ISIS brutes led an organised campaign of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/executions/\">executions</a>, enslavement, sexual violence, and forced recruitment of child soldiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some women were handed out as gifts to fighters who took part in the siege, while other women were sold for $50, and children for $35.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands of Yazidis who were kidnapped and kept as slaves by ISIS beasts remain missing, mass graves remain unexhumed, and Iraq has never prosecuted ISIS members for their crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina was one of thousands snatched by the bloodthirsty extremists in August 2014 when IS seized vast swathes of northern Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was dumped in Raqqa, Syria and kept as a sex slave at a brothel in the city for six months &#8211; where she was raped up to eight times a day by ISIS brutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeatedly drugged, raped and beaten alongside girls as young as 12, Lina faced unimaginable <span id=\"61cba811-4b2d-4f26-8203-fbc9ccfdf16c\" class=\"suggested-link\">horror</span> at the hands of ISIS fighters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while she was held captive, Lina identified one of the ISIS fighters who raped her as British dad-of-four Davis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;squaddie turned <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/885037954\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"documentarian (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">documentarian</a> Alan Duncan, Lina said Davis raped her at least 10 times &#8211; and would choose her every time he visited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During our interview with Lina, we showed her at least 30 photos of ISIS fighters from around the world &#8211; and she pointed to a photo of Davis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the videotaped interview, Alan pushes Lina on whether there is any doubt over the identity of Davis as one her rapists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she said she was &#8220;100 per cent&#8221; certain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking via a translator in Kurdistan, she said: &#8220;He was always mad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If I saw him now, I would know him. He was always beating me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He always chose me for himself. If he wasn&#8217;t out fighting, he would come every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When it wasn&#8217;t him, his friend would come instead.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina was kept as a slave by ISIS for four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was sold at least 15 times to different soldiers until she managed to flee in 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she was close to the Iraqi border, Lina managed to get hold of a phone and bravely call her brother who gave her instructions on how to get out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They destroyed my life and <span id=\"820379b1-6aef-49b8-955f-2807ab67cade\" class=\"suggested-link\">future</span>,&#8221; Lina told us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Life is a nightmare. I just want justice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former drug dealer Davis was deported from <span id=\"638dc258-c3f6-4003-b6c6-1b13cd5ddba9\" class=\"suggested-link\">Turkey</span> in August last year after serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence for membership of IS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his arrival at Luton airport, he was detained by British counter-terrorism cops and charged with three offences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was jailed for possession of a firearm and two charges of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Price, head of the CPS Special <span id=\"b5e44d2c-25be-4db7-a608-0bfe4302ef85\" class=\"suggested-link\">Crime</span> and Counter Terrorism Division, said: &#8220;Davis left the UK and travelled to Syria to involve himself with a proscribed terrorist organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While in Syria, he was able to call upon an associate or a network of like-minded individuals to arrange and deliver €20,000 to his wife, which was due to be taken to the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is sufficient evidence through the communication between Davis and his wife to demonstrate that the <span id=\"c8a1077a-f2c9-4a9b-b7f1-a16eca81e3f4\" class=\"suggested-link\">money</span> was to finance terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Photographs and messages recovered from his wife’s phone clearly show that Davis was part of the Islamic State group and concerned in terrorist-related activity in Syria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is only right he has been convicted and imprisoned in <span id=\"2cb1e24f-0800-48c1-8a73-712ed93552a7\" class=\"suggested-link\">this country</span>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Davis is yet to face any charges over his alleged crimes against the Yazidis. <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4399254/soldier-hero-alan-duncan-sex-slave-isis-rescued/#\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By speaking to The Sun, Lina hopes to push for British ISIS fighters &#8211; including Davis &#8211; to face prosecution in the UK and follow in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/\">Germany</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24717211\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5a67f33c-c242-4c83-a6ed-9bba0fa24365.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24717211\" width=\"960\" height=\"917\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A court sketch of Davis &#8211;

who he helped rescue in 2019 from an camp in Syria[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Yazidi women and dedicated lawyers are working tirelessly to gather evidence against ISIS soldiers in the hope of making them face justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June this year, a 37-year-old female ISIS member, identified only as &#8220;Nadine K&#8221;, was convicted in Germany of enslaving and abusing Yazidi woman Naveen Rasho during ISIS&#8217;s brutal campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alan has <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13328053/alan-duncan-cleared-isis-ptsd/\">spent years investigating ISIS&#8217;s crimes</a> &#8211; filming <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/interviews/\">interviews</a> with extremists and victims to highlight the devastating impact of IS&#8217;s actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 2019, it was the Scots sniper who was involved in the <a href=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4399254/soldier-hero-alan-duncan-sex-slave-isis-rescued/\">rescue of Naveen</a> from the notorious Al-Hawl refugee camp packed with thousands of terrorists in north-east Syria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has spent the last four years filming Naveen&#8217;s journey since her rescue for an upcoming <a aria-label=\"documentary (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/885037954\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">documentary</a>, helping her case get to trial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the conviction, Naveen said: &#8220;The justice that I hope to achieve through this trial not only concerns me personally but also our Yazidi community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I allow myself to speak on behalf of all survivors, stating that as individuals and as a Yazidi community, we can only process what happened to us if we experience justice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naveen, who testified in <span id=\"84c8d0c5-4aae-4d6a-a511-1f144d561910\" class=\"suggested-link\">court</span> over six days, was represented by a number of top lawyers &#8211; including British barrister <span id=\"a6b86efb-167f-4d14-b0b5-dda066c1b990\" class=\"suggested-link\">Amal Clooney</span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the third conviction of an ISIS member for genocide against the Yazidi community in Iraq and Syria since August 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amal said: &#8220;We have reached these milestones because of the bravery of survivors, like my client, who were raped and enslaved by ISIS but were determined to face their abusers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you to Germany, which has led the world in bringing ISIS to justice.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina&#8217;s lawyer, Zemfira Dlovani, is now urging Britain to follow suit and prosecute returning ISIS fighters who subjected Yazidis to horrifying abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Davis, as a British ISIS member, was involved in crimes against my client but also how many other crimes against the Yazidi women and children?&#8221; Zemfira told The Sun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now the British government must do all it can to investigate the crimes against my client and against all Yazidis by British ISIS members.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;More Yazidi witnesses must also be questioned and their statements included in <span id=\"dea9fac0-9462-4b55-ae60-a370004f07d6\" class=\"suggested-link\">court</span> proceedings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is what the Yazidi community wishes and expects. So far, the reference to the Yazidis and the terror against them has been completely missing in British judgements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The media can point the way here and focus the British jurisdiction on them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We Yazidi would like Britain to follow the German example and bring extensive proceedings against IS members with reference to the statements of the Ezidi victims of these IS henchmen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zemfira, the chairwoman of the Central Council of Yazidis, said more attention should also be paid to the women who went to Syria to fight for ISIS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She warned the use of the term &#8220;bride&#8221; often inherently downplays the involvements of the female fighters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The role of the woman was not just being a &#8216;bride&#8217; &#8211; but they were killing people, having slaves and beating people,&#8221; Zemfira said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They did everything the men did.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the world forgets about the plight of the Yazidi people, she added, then ISIS win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators with the Commission for International Justice and Accountability are gathering evidence to prosecute ISIS fighters for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the team said they had <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11680875/yazidi-sex-slaves-reveal-harrowing-details-of-being-abducted/\">identified 49 ISIS figures</a> who built and managed the slave trade &#8211; and nearly 170 slave owners who operated within it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have collected two million phone call records which they say will strengthen their case against the Yazidis’s perpetrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<div

between the second two images</figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence</a> investigation analysing <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a>’s facial features, gait and speech have concluded at least two body doubles have been taking his place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And his spokesman issued an <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24548517/vladimir-putin-seen-for-first-time-since-death-rumours/\">extraordinary denial </a>after an eminent professor and Kremlin “insiders” claimed Putin had died of a heart attack on October 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the categoric slapdown has failed to curb swirling rumours that unusually sprightly fake Vlads have been deployed by ruthless cronies left in a power vacuum by his sudden demise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An authoritative report by major Japanese TV network TBS used the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/\">latest AI</a> to examine facial recognition and body movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice analysis from the despot’s public appearances by Japan’s respected Institute of Audio Communication Laboratory also supported claims that doppelgangers were in play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">‘Corpse in storage’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Body double stories have circulated for years but were given credence — as the Putin health rumours spiralled earlier this year — by the Japanese team’s investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It concluded the real Putin hosted this year’s annual <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22293633/putin-prepares-victory-day-parade-kremlin-drone/\">Red Square Victory Day parade</a> on May 9 — but a different Putin may have inspected the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23462342/ukraine-missile-attack-crimea-bridge-holidaymakers/\">Crimean Bridge</a> 11 months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/technology/\">technology</a> found only a 53 per cent match of the pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TBS said: “Experts on face recognition would refer to this as ‘not matching’ in most cases, which leads us to the assumption this could be a double.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Putin appearance — on the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> War front line in Mariupol in March — produced only a 40 per cent match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Crimea and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19193066/inside-ukraine-mariupol-no-medicine-cholera-threat/\">Mariupol </a>Putins produced an even lower likeness score of just 18 per cent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report concluded: “Expert analysis is clearly displaying the high probability of at least two body doubles.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dupes are even said to have appeared at top-level meetings — infuriating allies who know the Russian leader personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24776577\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"

Putin</figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was said to be angry that one of the doubles mispronounced his name when sent to meet him in the capital Astana last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clearly grumpy Tokayev went on to address the formal session in the Kazakh language rather than Russian, leaving his guests scrambling for translation earpieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claims that Putin had collapsed and died last month first surfaced on messaging app Telegram’s General SVR channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It now has around 500,000 mainly Russian followers and claims inside knowledge from Putin’s circle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The channel has been reporting his ill-health for months — and says security council chief Nikolai Patrushev, 72, is now in charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia’s secret elite is even said to be planning to keep its grip on power by making a doppelganger run in next year’s presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doubles — with Putin features honed by plastic surgery — have been intensively coached on his views and how to respond at meetings and ceremonial occasions, it is claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former head of the FSB security service Patrushev is also said to be grooming his wealthy son, Dmitry, 46, to take over as president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last week he stunned an audience with what appeared to be a Putin eulogy — delivered in the past tense. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spymaster, dressed in a sombre black suit, said: “Tired of the dashing 1990s, Russian society was waiting for the solution of economic problems and strengthening security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It required a leader who could put the welfare of the population at the top of the agenda, display the highest human and organisational ­qualities, will and dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Such a leader was Putin, who first served as Prime Minister, then was elected President and, in accordance with the constitution, became Chairman of the Russian Security Council.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He knew in detail the state of affairs in the country, had a clear programme of action.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General SVR claims Putin’s corpse has been stored in deep freeze at the Valdai palace residence he shared with long-time partner Alina Kabaeva, 40.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinister theories — echoing the plot of the movie The Death Of Stalin in which the Russian leader’s death was covered up in 1953 — have also been fuelled by Kabaeva’s disappearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former Olympic gymnast has not been seen since the alleged date of her partner’s sudden death — and is claimed to be under house arrest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent Putin critic Professor Valery Solovey also believes Putin is dead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming inside knowledge, he alleged Putin had been given 18 months to live after being diagnosed with cancer and Parkinson Disease in February 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The professor said: “He died in the evening around 8.40pm on Thursday, October 26.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now he is in the refrigerator compartment of his residence in Valdai. Humiliating, isn’t it? Well, probably deservedly so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There is no doubt about his physical death. Absolutely none — not the slightest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shadowy climate of fear and secrecy created by Putin makes it impossible to pin down the truth behind the fantastical claims being whipped up by online conspiracists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/\">Kremlin </a>chiefs took the unusual step of denying their leader’s death the day after his alleged demise last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov branded the death and body double claims a social media hoax, adding: “Everything is fine with him.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading

of gunfire and kids screaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forty plates sat on the table on a street near Trafalgar Square — <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24602299/children-hostages-hamas-parents-release/\">each symbolising an innocent child held captive by terrorists</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cupcakes were handed out by teary-eyed organisers and birthday invitations had a photo of little Emily&#8217;s face. Yellow ribbons were handed to passers-by, with tourists stopping to look at birthday banners and kids&#8217; teddies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli graffiti artist Benzi Brofman painted a beautiful picture of her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily was abducted from the kibbutz she was living at. Last night, her cousin Suzie Golding, 43, thanked the public for their support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told The Sun: “This gives us hope. Emily&#8217;s name and face are at the forefront of so many people&#8217;s thoughts. I want people to keep Emily in their thoughts and prayers. She is an innocent child and has nothing to do with the conflict.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suzie, of Shoeburyness, Essex, added<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24658899/emily-tom-hand-gaza-hostage-israel-heartbreaking-wish/\"> Emily&#8217;s father Tom Hand</a>, 63, who was born in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/dublin/\">Dublin </a>but grew up in England, has now devoted his life to getting her freed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Yesterday&#8217;s event was organised by Hostages and Missing Families Forum UK and the Israeli Embassy. One of the organisers, Florit Shoihet, said: &#8220;Many Israelis and Jews in the world feel that the events of October 7 were not taken seriously enough.

region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the crude Russia tactic fails as the Soviet-era MT-LB hits a landmine triggering a giant explosion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The armoured vehicle had been loaded with two tons of TNT before being directed at the Ukrainian frontline, reported Krymskiy Veter Telegram channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The vehicle ran over an anti-tank mine &#8211; &nbsp;and caused an epic explosion,” reported the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/news/\">news</a> outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MT-LB is a Soviet-era multi-purpose, fully amphibious tracked armoured vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally built in Soviet Ukraine half a century ago, the museum piece is one of several old crocks <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a> had brought back to life due to a shortage of armoured vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chilling tactic is similar to that used by terror group <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/isis/\">ISIS</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/driving/\">driving</a> explosives-laden <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/suvs/\">SUVs</a> into <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iraq/\">Iraqi</a>

as Putin faces a failing war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, bungling <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22735137/russia-detonates-tank-explosives-ukraine/\">Russian troops sent a tank crammed with six tons of explosives</a> towards a Ukrainian position before detonating it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage showed a Soviet-era T-54 tank packed with explosives rolling towards a Ukrainian trench near Marinka, Donetsk Oblast, guided by a remote control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then hits a land mine before being struck by a Ukrainian rocket &#8211; causing it to burst into a raging ball of smoke and fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the tank embarrassingly missed its target, having detonated around 200ft from the Ukrainian troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian propaganda account &#8220;Romanov&#8221; claims the 70-year-old tank was stuffed with up to six tons of bombs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after Putin&#8217;s troops also <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24765989/russia-stop-ukraine-advance-dnipro-river/\">scrambled to stop a surprise Ukraine advance on the east side of the Dnipro river</a> after Moscow admitted losing ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western officials said troops have moved 2.5miles from the river into territory formerly held by the enemy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local Russian governor Vladimir Saldo said: “There is justifiable concern about Ukrainian armed forces on the left bank of the Dnipro.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western sources said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196713/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>&nbsp;had put hundreds of troops and armoured vehicles across the river— the site of the Khakovka dam, destroyed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196707/russia/\">Russia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One said: “This gives Ukraine a significant foothold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The fact the Russians are unable to push them back from there is encouraging and positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Where Ukraine see opportunity, they will exploit it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saldo admitted it was “more manpower than we can destroy”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The build-up of Ukrainian forces has forced Russia to pull troops from elsewhere to stop the advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier Andriy Yermak, President <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/volodymyr-zelensky/\">Zelensky</a>’s chief of staff, said troops had dug in in “against all odds”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24775658\" class=\"wp-caption

in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/\">German</a>, was installed in 2014 and the slide was 168ft high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It attracted a lot of media coverage and was voted the world&#8217;s &#8220;Best New Waterpark Ride&#8221; at the 2014&nbsp;Golden Ticket Awards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for Verrückt came from 63-year-old Jeff Henry, who co-owned the Schlitterbahn parks and acted as the company’s chief visionary, a conjurer of splashy joyrides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff was considered a genius in the water park business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author Tim O’Brien once wrote in his book: &#8221;&nbsp;Jeff was an out-of-the-box visionary of waterpark designs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff often used to say that his goal in life was to make Schlitterbahn customers happy and put a smile on their faces</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview, he once said: &#8220;I’m a water showman. That’s what I do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Verrückt, a ride that lasted only eighteen seconds, was considered to be his crowning achievement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the slide opened to the public, in July 2014, riders’ reviews were like a dream for the operators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But things went upside down after a gruesome tragedy forced the iconic water slide to shut down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 7, 2016, Caleb Schwab, the 10-year-old son of Kansas state representative&nbsp;Scott Schwab, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9727418/worlds-tallest-water-slide-decapitated-boy-dangerous-designer-survive/\">died while riding Verrückt</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The raft he was riding went airborne during the ascent of the second hump and impacted the metal support of the netting, decapitating him on the spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reportedly, Caleb, who weighed 74 pounds, had been allowed to sit in the front of the raft, rather than between the two women accompanying him who weighed more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This created an uneven&nbsp;weight distribution, which some experts concluded may have contributed to the raft going airborne. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two people with whom he was riding suffered minor injuries – one suffered a broken jaw, while the other suffered a facial bone fracture and needed stitches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the immediate aftermath, Schlitterbahn Kansas City was closed pending an inspection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the park reopened three days later, the ride remained closed for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking about the safety measures that were in place at the park, one former employee said: &#8220;The only inspections we&#8217;ve ever done is just people riding down slides one time, saying &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;re good to go for the rest of the day now.'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler Miles, the operations manager of the park, had reportedly received 17 separate staff reports during the 2015 and 2016 summer seasons about how the raft in which Caleb was riding when he died required maintenance, including five in that week alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Kansas City Park continues to operate, Verrückt has now been dismantled &#8211; making Kilimanjaro&nbsp;the tallest water slide again. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24771366\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 869px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/world-s-tallest-waterslide-higher-860287667.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=859\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24771366\" width=\"859\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Caleb Schwab, 10, died while riding Verrückt in 2016</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24771372\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2016-riding-verruckt-water-slide-257726666.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24771372\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>David Strickland</figcredit></figure>He was the son of Scott Schwab, a Kansas state lawmaker[/caption]"},{"title":"Sacha Baron Cohen tells TikTok ‘you’re creating biggest anti-Jew movement since Nazis’ as he leads celeb condemnation","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24770124/sacha-baron-cohen-tiktok-celebrities-antisemitism-israel-hamas-war/","pubDate":"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 13:21:12 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Ellie Doughty"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Apps"},{"#cdata-section":"Influencers"},{"#cdata-section":"Social Media"},{"#cdata-section":"Terrorism"},{"#cdata-section":"TikTok"},{"#cdata-section":"Twitter"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 24770124 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>SACHA Baron Cohen told TikTok execs they are &#8220;creating the biggest anti-Semitic movement since the Nazis&#8221;

in the meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presser agreed there was &#8220;truth&#8221; to Baron Cohen&#8217;s comments about social media companies taking more direct action in such situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese-owned company is battling escalating claims that it is promoting pro-Hamas and anti-Israel content on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said on Thursday that it was &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24766874/tiktok-delete-influencers-osama-bin-laden-israel-gaza/\">proactively and aggressively removing</a>&#8221; videos from the app showing influencers discussing bin Laden&#8217;s &#8220;Letter to America&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many creators &#8211; often American &#8211; have been posting clips on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/\">TikTok</a>&nbsp;where they discuss the manifesto and even encourage people to read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most watched clip, with over a million views, is a scrolling video of the PDF for people to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/al-qaeda/\">Al-Qaeda</a>&nbsp;leader&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4824770/osama-bin-laden-death-9-11/\">Osama Bin Laden</a>&nbsp;issued the twisted 4,000-word manifesto to lay out his hatred of the West a year after the horrific Twin Towers attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terror chief tried to justify the 9/11 atrocities on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/page/63/\">US</a>, railed against America and made a chilling demand for the Jewish state to be destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokesperson told The Sun: &#8220;Content promoting this letter clearly violates our rules on supporting any form of terrorism.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One TikTok user on Wednesday&#8217;s call said the letter had become the &#8220;talk of the app&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said: &#8220;In regards to trending topics right now as we speak, this trend needs to end. This app needs to ban this letter.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other users of the app said they reported harassment to the company but was not able to speak directly to any representatives, and waited three to five days for a response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presser said on the call: &#8220;To hear that this place, this platform, this community that has brought you so much joy and helps each of you as individuals is becoming a place that feels like somewhere that you’re not sure you want to spend time on, I mean, that’s devastating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is where we get the feedback, this is where we hear what isn’t working, he added towards the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then told others in the meeting that he was &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; to admit much of the information was new to him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several US lawmakers have called for the app to be banned, arguing that Beijing could be influencing content through certain algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both antisemitic and Islamophobic content has increased online since the Israel-Hamas war escalated following the October 7 attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jewish advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League has claimed that antisemitic content has increased by over 919 per cent on Twitter/X, and 28 per cent on Facebook since the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We recognise this is an incredibly difficult and fearful time for millions of people around the world and in our TikTok community,&#8221; TikTok told The Sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our leadership has been meeting with creators, civil society, human rights experts and stakeholders to listen to their experiences and feedback on how TikTok can remain a place for community, discovery, and sharing authentically.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24771542\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 802px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/debra-messing-speaks-march-israel-859618366.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=792\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24771542\" width=\"792\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Debra Messing, another celebrity present during the meeting with TikTok executives, speaks during a March For Israel in Washington DC in November[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24771566\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/general-view-tiktok-headquarters-october-860300605.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24771566\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>The company is fighting claims that it is promoting pro-Hamas and anti-Israel content on the app[/caption]"},{"title":"Inside abandoned 430-room luxury resort once visited by super rich complete with 18-hole golf course","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24767335/abandoned-430-room-luxury-resort-18-hole-golf/","pubDate":"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 11:58:18 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Sayan Bose"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Homes"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 24767335 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p><br>A LUXURIOUS high-rise hotel that dates back to the early 20th century has been left to rot after owners failed to pay taxes worth millions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Established in 1901 by famous hotelier Charles Slutsky, the Nevele Grande is situated in the picturesque Catskills region in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york/\">New York</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24769059\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ruins-nevele-grande-hotel-high-860268221.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24769059\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Nevele Grande was built in 1901 by famous hotelier Charles Slutsky[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24769087\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ruins-nevele-grande-hotel-high-860268298.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24769087\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>It is situated in the picturesque Catskills region in New York[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24769761\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/abandoned-hotel-nevele-grande-ski-860268080.png?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-24769761\" width=\"960\" height=\"429\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>You Tube / @theproperpeople</figcredit></figure>The hotel was made to cater to ultra-rich guests[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Surrounded by two lakes in a valley west of the Shawangunk Mountains, the extravagant property grew over time to become a vacation home for the super-rich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nevele Grande Resort lived up to its grandiose name &#8211; at its peak, it had 430 guest rooms and employed a staff of 800.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within two decades, the resort was extended with new wings and a lot of other lavish features exclusively available for the visiting guests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1964, architect Herbert D. Phillips designed a 10-storey dodecahedral tower, which became the resort’s crown jewel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sat at the main entrance, and its wings were connected by&nbsp;massive underground tunnels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tower soon got its famous moniker &#8211; &#8220;Presidential Tower&#8221; &#8211; after it was used by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/\">US </a>President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other lavish amenities included two magnificent&nbsp;ballrooms, several conference halls, and a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/hawaii/\">Hawaiian</a>-themed&nbsp;nightclub, which were excessive &#8211; even by Catskills standards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who wished to experience the natural beauty of the property could visit its two natural&nbsp;lakes, which are fed by a 35-foot waterfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/golf/\">golf</a> courses on the site, designed by Robert Trent Jones and Tom Fazio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first, an 18-hole course, opened in the 1940s and was later renovated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A smaller nine-hole course was built later with the Fallsview resort upon the two hotels merging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easternmost part of the property was home to the Waikiki indoor&nbsp;pool&nbsp;and a health club, beyond which was an extravagant ski chalet and slope. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guests had access to a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/24099251/abandoned-olympic-venue-ice-rink-winter-female-figure-skating/\">skating </a>rink, a roller rink, a skate and ski shop, a snack bar, and an ornate lobby filled with fireplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like all good things come to an end, Nevele Grande too met its dark fate soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2006, the resort was struggling financially &#8211; so much so that the Fallsview portion had to be sold to make up for the unpaid expenses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;managed to remain open for three more years before closing without notice in 2009 after owners Joel Hoffman and Mitchell Wolff failed to pay taxes on the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had accumulated $342,687.22 in property <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/22813503/council-tax-debt-5-billion-owed-arrears-your-rights/\">tax debt</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, an auction was set up to sell the resort, but was soon called off after a potential buyer expressed intent to seal the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the grand hotel remained unsold and eventually fell into disrepair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2012, Nevele Investors announced the Nevele Grande Resort would undergo a $500 million renovation to turn it into a resort and&nbsp;casino &#8211; but the proposal was rejected by the state due to gambling laws. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company later said it would repair the complex with an aim to reopen in March 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, just a year and a half later, the developer said the necessary funding hadn’t been secured. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This had left the property’s future uncertain, until earlier this year when 1100 Arrow LLC bought the complex for $5 million. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move was fueled by plans of a new facility with lodging, accompanied by a 126-unit housing development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the plan, developers now expect to construct a 68-room main lodge hotel, a 60-room condo hotel, and 10 rooms in ledge cottages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would also build  46 units of single-family homes, 44 units of townhouses, and 36 units of multi-family village estates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24769685\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\"

soldiers ducking amid an explosion[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as Palestinian civilians have been left fleeing for their lives as Israel attempts to destroy Hamas after the terror group massacred 1,200 civilians on October 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New dramatic video shows Israel Defence Forces (IDF) commandos in a brutal gunfight with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a> at the hotel in Mulched, in the north of the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soldiers can be seen combing through the site while wielding guns as they attempt to snare Hamas brutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF also unleashed a tank &#8211; using it to blast at buildings as troops stormed the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stockpile of weapons discovered by troops were destroyed, the IDF said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the IDF also released footage of another raid at the  Al-Shati refugee camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage shows soldiers working their way through an urban environment razed to the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Israeli forces can be seen making their way through the streets and going from building to building while opening fire on unseen targets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can also be seen conducting a raid inside a building as the footage ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF said: &#8220;Last week the fighters of the commando formation raided on foot in cooperation with armour, engineering and air support forces on the north of the Al-Shati camp, the most densely populated place the IDF has operated since the beginning of the fighting in Gaza.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after the IDF last night released footage of a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24766047/hamas-tunnel-gaza-hospital-video-idf/\">Hamas tunnel they found near the al-Shifa hospital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said: “<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24764332/hamas-al-shifa-tunnel-weapons-discovered-footage/\">Hamas’ tunnelling infrastructure</a>&nbsp;was exposed inside the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Furthermore, a vehicle for the<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">&nbsp;October 7 massacre</a>&nbsp;was discovered, containing weapons and ammunition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In searches in the Rantisi Hospital troops continued to unearth a tunnel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrances to the 311-mile “Gaza Metro” were suspected to be inside the hospital after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas terrorists</a>&nbsp;fled into the complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24751347/hamas-mri-gaza-hospital-idf/\">IDF troops seized the A&amp;E and MRI departments</a>&nbsp;at the al-Shifa hospital in a 2am raid and uncovered an arsenal of weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also seized laptops containing names of some of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of victims were kidnapped by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a>&nbsp;during the horror&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24612569/archive-footage-released-haunting-hamas-israel-attacks/\">October 7 massacre</a>&nbsp;&#8211; and haven&#8217;t been heard from since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today the IDF confirmed it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24763759/israel-finds-hostage-body-al-shifa-hospital-gaza-war/\">recovered two bodies of hostages</a> kidnapped during the October 7 massacre near the al-Shifa hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli&nbsp;troops discovered the body of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24730757/israeli-soldier-noa-marciano-dead/\">Corporal Noa Marciano, 19</a>, at “a structure adjacent to&#8221; the facility after she was killed by Hamas terrorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teenager was serving in the Nahal Oz base when it was overrun by militants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile Yehudit Weiss – who the IDF says was taken from her home in Be’eri – was found dead in a structure next to the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 65-year-old had been identified by forensic examiners and the family has been informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as families living in Gaza have been caught in the brutal crossfire, with regular accusations that the terrorists are attempting to use them as “human shields”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the northern part of the strip has been turned into a devastated warzone &#8211; with ruined buildings, dwindling supplies and horrific suffering for Gaza’s people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Red Cross estimates that some 1.5million civilians have been forced to flee south amid the Israeli onslaught from land, air and sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figures for the death toll remain unverified &#8211; but Hamas’ health officials claim more than 11,000 civilians, including more than 4,500 children have been killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel disputes these figures &#8211; and US President Joe Biden said he had “no confidence” in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Benjamin Netanyahu admitted Israel has &#8220;not been successful&#8221; in reducing civilian casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the deaths, however, must be blamed on Hamas &#8211; not Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as the horror continues there have been growing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24768443\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\"

relationship, which caused a huge scandal in the small town, continued to develop &#8211; but she put off marrying him for a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already married when she taught him, and with a daughter who was his classmate, Brigitte assumed he&#8217;d move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The French president&#8217;s parents sent him to Paris to another school, and she said she told herself that he would &#8220;fall in love with someone his [own] age&#8221;, once there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this turned out not to be the case as many years later &#8211; the pair, 24 years apart in age, were married.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brigitte&#8217;s son is just three years older than her husband, and her daughters are also close to him in age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently Macron&#8217;s parents even thought he was in love with Laurence, Brigitte&#8217;s daughter and his classmate before they found out the truth, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-book-idUSKBN17E21X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His father reportedly asked Brigitte to stay away from him until he turned 18, to which she tearfully said: &#8220;I cannot promise you anything&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She reportedly once said: &#8220;Nobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story. That belongs to us. That is our secret.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When her children were teenagers &#8211; like Emmanuel &#8211; Brigitte claimed she didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;wreck their lives&#8221; with her relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That lasted ten years, the time to put them on the rails. You can imagine what they were hearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on my life,&#8221; she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They married in 2007 when Macron was in his late twenties after her children were older and she had divorced her first husband,&nbsp;banker Andre Louis Auziere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Macron later hit the political limelight,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3399402/president-emmanuel-macron-wife-brigitte-trogneux-kiss-picture/\">footage of him&nbsp;kissing his future wife on the cheek</a>&nbsp;– when he was just a teen and she was his married teacher &#8211; emerged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is now step-father to his wife’s three adult children, including son Sebastien who is two years older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macron does not have any biological children with his wife, although he is also the step-grandfather of&nbsp;Brigitte’s seven grandchildren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He won the 2017 French presidential election for his centrist party La République En Marche!

forums on the internet, he thought he hit a jackpot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rutsch read that blaring heavy thrash metal music from underwater speakers may be the trick to scaring off the killer creatures and had to give it a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years orcas have started to frequently <span id=\"6b6709a2-8de0-4348-8661-44be5a8ea4ce\" class=\"suggested-link\">target</span> boats in the vicinity of the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22783828/orcas-attack-yachts-smashing-heads-biting-rudder-gibraltar/\">Strait of Gibraltar</a> and other areas surrounding the Iberian Peninsula.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts aren&#8217;t entirely sure why the apex predators have started attacking in these regions but some marine biologists believe a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22475189/killer-whale-attacks-revenge-white-gladis/\">notorious orca dubbed White Gladis</a> taught members of her highly intelligent species how to take revenge after she was involved in a collision with a vessel a few years back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the exact reason behind the relentless attacks remains unclear, sailors are now becoming desperate for an antidote &#8211; leading Rutsch to attempt the metal music method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through his research, the sailor came across a shared <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/spotify/\">Spotify</a> playlist, called Metal for Orcas, specially curated by other sailors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headbanging playlist included songs aptly titled The Blood of <span id=\"45af3de4-e8ff-4bd6-b12d-11d3fc463124\" class=\"suggested-link\">Power</span>, Infinite Terror, Stretched and Devoured, and Dead but Still Alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Rutsch was out at sea in November, he and his crew tried out the musical hack on a pod of killer whales who were slowly surrounding his boat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With high hopes, the sailor plunged his underwater speakers into the sea and blasted the thrash tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the killer whales succeeded in their attack, damaging the boat&#8217;s rudders and disabling the steering function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rutsch&#8217;s boat had to be towed back to shore by Spanish authorities who came to his rescue, according to the Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German sailor&#8217;s encounter is just one in a long string of recent incidents involving orcas attacking boats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24662848/boat-sinks-orca-attack-killer-whales-white-gladis/\">pod of killer whales attacked a boa</a>t in the Gibraltar Strait, sinking the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/yacht/\">yacht</a> in the fourth incident of its kind in just two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The orcas relentlessly pummelled the boat&#8217;s rudder and damaged the vessel beyond repair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ambush is believed to have come from a notorious pod of whales led by ringleader White Gladis which has <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22475189/killer-whale-attacks-revenge-white-gladis/\">been apparently attacking sailors</a> for at least three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orca attacks on boats travelling through the Strait of Gibraltar &#8211; also known as Orca Alley &#8211; were first reported in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ambushes, which range from orcas simply approaching boats to actively interfering with them, have repeatedly occurred in the stretch of water between <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196716/spain/\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/5759446/morocco/\">Morocco</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such attack happened just months ago when a 50ft yacht was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22614991/killer-whale-white-gladis-boat-attack/\">attacked by four killer whales in the same waters</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another, in August, even saw <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22386590/pod-killer-whales-sink-brit-boat-ramming-attack/\">a tourist boat rammed for an hour</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last three years have seen the number of attacks worryingly rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there were&nbsp;207 interactions between orcas and boats off the coast of Portugal and Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is up from 197 in 2021 and 52 in 2020 according to GT Atlantic Orca.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_23548797\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 573px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo-shows-moment-tourist-boat-838689262.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=563\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-23548797\" width=\"563\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>CEN</figcredit></figure>A pod of killer whales attacked a tourist boat in August[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_22615210\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NEW_AFP_33GM376jpg-JS821794284.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"A picture taken on May 31, 2023 shows the rudder of a ship damaged by killer whales (Orcinus orca) while sailing in the Strait of Gibraltar and taken for repairs at the &quot;Pecci Shipyards&quot;

past[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas after hundreds were killed and kidnapped during the October 7 attack &#8211; with Palestinian civilians left fleeing for their lives as Israel attempts to destroy Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noa was one of dozens hauled back over the border to Gaza after Hamas terrorists stormed over the border. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was serving in the Nahal Oz base when it was overrun by militants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas released footage of the teen soldier speaking to the camera four days after she was taken hostage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She identified herself and confirmed she was being held captive in the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza before it cut to vile images of what the terrorists claimed was Noa&#8217;s dead body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, the IDF confirmed Noa&#8217;s body had been discovered at a &#8220;structure adjacent to&#8221; al-Shifa hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heartbreaking pictures show her mum Adi sobbing over her beloved daughter&#8217;s coffin as she was laid to rest today in Modiin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge crowd filled the streets as Noa&#8217;s coffin, with the Israel flag draped over it, was carried by soldiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow military personnel were seen in tears as Noa&#8217;s dad Avi tried to comfort his wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A solemn image shows Adi, wearing a white T-shirt with her daughter&#8217;s photo on&#8217; standing over her grave with her husband.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after Yehudit Weiss – who the IDF says was taken from her home in Be’eri – was found dead in a structure next to the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 65-year-old had been identified by forensic examiners and the family has been informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Israeli military also claimed rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were found in the building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF said: &#8220;The national task before our eyes is to locate the missing and return the abducted persons home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The IDF is operating alongside and in full coordination with the relevant national and security institutions in order to pursue these tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will not cease from the mission until it will be completed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mum-of-five was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her husband, Shmulik Weiss, was found murdered in the safe room of their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of victims were kidnapped by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hamas-news/\">Hamas</a>&nbsp;during the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/horror/\">horror</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24612569/archive-footage-released-haunting-hamas-israel-attacks/\">October 7 massacre</a>&nbsp;&#8211; and haven&#8217;t been heard from since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is now fresh hope for the captives as Israeli soldiers say they have found photographic evidence of them at al-Shifa hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67436154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BBC</a>&nbsp;during a tour of the facility: &#8220;We uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the devices were found alongside a number of military <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/books/\">books</a> and pamphlets the IDF believe suggest Hamas terrorists were there &#8220;within the last few days&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lt Col Conricus said a map was also found that appeared to mark entry and exit routes from the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/israel/\">Israel</a>&nbsp;has claimed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24739513/united-states-hamas-al-shifa-hospital-israel-war-gaza/\">the hospital is the &#8220;beating heart&#8221;</a>&nbsp;of Hamas, and this week launched a raid to hunt down terrorists using it as cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF footage showed troops taking in humanitarian as thousands of patients, doctors and displaced Palestinians&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24737903/hamas-bunker-israeli-hostages-children-hospital/\">have been trapped inside the besieged&nbsp;complex</a>&nbsp;for weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF also claimed that it had successfully provided incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel said what is called a &#8220;precise and targeted&#8221;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">raid inside al Shifa</a>&nbsp;is a &#8220;military necessity&#8221; to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel-hamas-war/\">root out Hamas</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as families living in Gaza have been caught in the brutal crossfire, with regular accusations that the terrorists are attempting to use them as “human shields”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the northern part of the strip has been turned into a devastated warzone &#8211; with ruined buildings, dwindling supplies and horrific suffering for Gaza’s people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Red Cross estimates that some 1.5million civilians have been forced to flee south amid the Israeli onslaught from land, air and sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figures for the death toll remain unverified &#8211; but Hamas’ health officials claim more than 11,000 civilians, including more than 4,500 children have been killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel disputes these figures &#8211; and US President Joe Biden said he had “no confidence” in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Benjamin Netanyahu admitted Israel has &#8220;not been successful&#8221; in reducing civilian casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the deaths, however, must be blamed on Hamas &#8211; not Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as the horror continues there have been growing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_24771096\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img decoding=\"async\"
