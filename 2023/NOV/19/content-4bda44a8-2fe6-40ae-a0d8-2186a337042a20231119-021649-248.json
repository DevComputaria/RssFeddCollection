And North Korea continues to have a close relationship with Iran, having provided Tehran with rockets, missiles, and weaponry over the years, in return for needed cash for their nuclear and missile programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has been transparent in his relatively recent embrace of Russia, with his public visit to Russia for meetings with Vladimir Putin and the recent visit of Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, to Pyongyang for meetings with Kim.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members enjoy unlimited access to Cipher Brief content, including analysis with experts, private virtual briefings with experts, the M-F Open Source Report and the weekly Dead Drop &#8211;

What followed was Kim Jong Un enshrining nuclear weapons in North Korea’s constitution and last year proclaiming a “first use” policy for nuclear weapons if there is an imminent or perceived to be an imminent threat to the North’s leadership or its command-and-control infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the failed Hanoi Summit in 2019, North Korea has eschewed any talks with the U.S. or South Korea, while building more nuclear weapons and launching more sophisticated ballistic missiles, to include hypersonic and cruise missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea’s Defense Minister, Shin Won-sik, recently publicly expressed concern that North Korea could conduct a surprise attack on South Korea, like the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas.&nbsp; Shin said South Korea would have to enhance its surveillance of North Korea and suspend a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement – with buffer zones along sea and land boundaries and no-fly zones – in order to resume surveillance of an unpredictable North Korea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any intentional or accidental flare-up on the Korean Peninsula could escalate quickly, with the potential to destabilize the whole of Northeast Asia.&nbsp; And given the current alignment of North Korea with a revanchist Russia and Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, the chances are that North Korea may now feel emboldened to challenge South Korea and, as they did in March 2010, with the sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan, killing 46 seamen, they may perpetrate another act of aggression against the South.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Subscriber+Members</a> will receive invitations via email to a private virtual briefing with Ambassador Joe Detrani and former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Dr. Michael Vickers on Tuesday, November 21.&nbsp;

China’s current Foreign Minister and Politburo member, Wang Yi, hosted the talks and on September 19, 2005, North Korea agreed to dismantle all nuclear weapons and facilities in return for security assurances, economic development assistance and a path to normal relations with the U.S., South Korea, and Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco from November 11 to 17, during which President Joe Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, will be an opportune time for the two leaders to show the world that the U.S. and China can again cooperate on subjects as important as North Korea.

The October 7 massacre perpetrated against innocent Israelis, Americans and other foreign nationals by the terrorist group Hamas and enabled by its primary patron Iran represents a failure for U.S. intelligence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time the Intelligence Community (IC) has been surprised, nor will it be the last.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the scope of the Hamas attacks and the regional and global implications, this failure has been compared with al Qaeda’s attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001, as well as the Egyptian-Syrian attacks on Israel in October 1973.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to previous intelligence shortcomings, detailed post-mortem assessments were conducted to understand what happened and recommend remedial actions. For example, most Americans are familiar with the report of the national commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; Decades earlier, then-Director of Central Intelligence William Colby commissioned a multi-agency assessment of the performance of the IC before the October 1973 attacks on Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Declassified in 2009, that post-mortem concluded that intelligence on Egypt’s plans and capabilities had been “plentiful, ominous, and often accurate.”&nbsp; While some analysts considered the idea that Egypt might attack, IC analysts ultimately judged there would be no attack.&nbsp; As the assessment stated, the IC’s conclusions “were – quite simply, obviously, and starkly – wrong.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines should direct two separate after-action reviews. One review should assess the performance of individual IC organizations. Here, each IC agency director should be tasked to review their organization’s performance by determining what relevant information was collected, the analytic perspective(s) adopted and their basis, when and how that information was shared internally and externally, and what else might have been done to sound the alarm of the impending Hamas attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing?

That independent review team should look across the various agencies to assess broader IC-wide collection and analytic challenges that precluded timely and effective warning of the Hamas attacks and also make actionable recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of both reviews should be shared with the DNI and her staff as well as with members of the National Security Council and the Congressional intelligence and defense oversight committees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these reviews, the attacks should spur DNI Haines to reverse two decisions made by her predecessors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the National Intelligence Officer for Warning position should be reestablished. The purpose of this position, first established by DCI Stansfield Turner, was “to avoid surprise to the President, the National Security Council, and the Armed Forces of the United States by foreign events of major importance… The warning mission will give highest priority to warning of an attack on the U.S. or its allies”.&nbsp; Clearly, now is the time to resurrect the NIO for Warning position and the DNI should appoint a highly respected intelligence official in this position with the resources to effectively carry out a rejuvenated IC-wide warning function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the Foreign Denial and Deception Committee (FDDC) should be reconstituted. The absence of a dedicated IC cadre focused on adversary strategic and tactical denial and deception (D&amp;D) may have contributed to the lack of timely and effective warning of Hamas’ plans and operations.&nbsp; A few hours of annual D&amp;D training for select IC analysts is insufficient to inculcate a keen understanding of adversary D&amp;D tactics, techniques and procedures or their impact on IC collection and analysis. Resurrection of a robust FDDC with a strong leader appointed by the DNI will yield benefits as the U.S. faces increasingly sophisticated threats from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and their proxies, each of which is well practiced in the art of deception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some will argue that now – with ongoing hostilities – is not the time to conduct detailed reviews of the IC’s performance.&nbsp; We strongly disagree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar reviews were conducted in parallel with on-going military operations following the Egyptian-Syrian attacks, al Qaeda’s attacks on 9/11, and numerous other incidents. Stated simply, the sooner we understand how and why the IC got it wrong, the sooner we can implement much-needed remedial measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actions recommended herein may not eliminate the risk of strategic or tactical surprise in the future, but they will assist the IC in deciphering adversaries’ on-going, sophisticated efforts to deny the US and our friends and allies, information about their growing capabilities and nefarious plots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must learn from our mistakes and better position America’s absolutely vital intelligence services for future crises and conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?&nbsp;

Many analysts of global affairs play fast and loose with the term “game changer.” My somewhat curmudgeonly analysis of events like <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/israel-uae-agreement-game-changer-israel\">UAE-Israel normalization</a> or the assassination of Iran’s Quds Force Chief <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/has-iran-learned-its-lesson-about-crossing-donald-trumps-red-line-122166\">Qassem Soleimani</a> argued that the strategic environment, from Israel’s perspective at least, would remain largely unchanged after those events. What happened in Israel on October 7, 2023 is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes the brutal Hamas rampage in Israel distinct from other events is that is has fundamentally altered Jerusalem’s perception. Before UAE-Israel normalization, under-the-table cooperation had existed between the two countries for decades and the 1978 Egypt-Israel peace accord after decades of conflict was obviously a more significant shift in dynamics. In terms of the assassination of Soleimani, in years past the U.S. had assassinated many dangerous leaders of terror organizations and Israel had taken out Iranian nuclear scientists; the U.S.’s 2020 UAV strike in Baghdad may have been the more easily attributable and the target was a higher profile official than usual, but this was in a sense “more of the same.” Hamas’s recent terror attack which unleashed unspeakable horrors on the Israeli population, including burning people alive, decapitating infants, and other atrocities, changed how Israelis see their Gazan neighbors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Israelis viewed Hamas as two things at once. While it was certainly a radical jihadist terror group with a dangerous rocket arsenal, it also appeared to be a force for restraint in the Gaza Strip. When Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another Gaza-based terror organization associated with the “axis of resistance,” sought to stir up conflict with Israel, Hamas often remained passive or at times even actively prevented from them from doing so. The thinking was, Hamas ruled Gaza and therefore had an interest in seeing the enclave avoid humanitarian catastrophe – Israel could use carrots and sticks to ensure that the group did not take steps that would endanger Israeli national security. For more than a decade this appeared to work well, with only minor flareups every few years that stayed well below the threshold of “all-out war.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the slaughter that took place on October 7th, which was the single deadliest day in Israel’s history, Jerusalem’s perception of Hamas as a “useful irritant” changed. The death toll and the brutality stoked an existential angst in the country that will leave Jerusalem’s decisionmakers with little choice but to decimate the group and level much of Gaza. Initial news reports, including from <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/10/israels-netanyahu-has-little-choice-launch-gaza-ground-operation\">Al-Monitor</a>, indicate that the terrorist group did not expect the attacks to reach the proportions that they did – and now they will suffer the consequences of their “success.” It is existentially important for Jerusalem to leave Gaza and the rest of the region (especially Lebanese Hezbollah) with a sense that Hamas and the people under its rule deeply regret what was done. The tragedy of this is that Hamas’s defensive tactics include melting back into it the millions of human shields under its control in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members enjoy unlimited access to Cipher Brief content, including analysis with experts, private virtual briefings with experts, the M-F Open Source Report and the weekly Dead Drop &#8211; an insider look at the latest gossip in the national security space.&nbsp; It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.&nbsp; Upgrade your access today.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Within Israel, the country has largely set aside its political divisions but the lack of serious leadership from Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government is palpable. &nbsp;Netanyahu has been largely absent from the public eye and his speeches have been uninspired when compared with that of former Prime Minister <a href=\"https://x.com/danielamram3/status/1711040793404735923?s=20\">Naftali Bennet</a>, who even showed up to <a href=\"https://news.walla.co.il/break/3614274\">reserve</a> duty. Netanyahu’s ministers who contributed significantly to the internal strife over the past year have been largely absent or <a href=\"https://x.com/hasolidit/status/1711747560593936528?s=20\">marginalized</a>, but even without the rabblerousers attacking his political opponents the Prime Minister has failed to bring in all major centrist parties into his orbit to form a national unity government which disposes of the far-right extremists. &nbsp;Reforming the coalition from a collection of far-right of provocateurs into a collection of centrist experienced professionals would be especially useful in sending the message to Hamas that their moment of opportunity to strike a divided Israel has since passed. Netanyahu, however, is unwilling to part ways with the far-right members of his coalition and so only the State Camp Party has joined his emergency government, while the country’s second largest party Yesh Atid has refused. Reportedly, Netanyahu is concerned that doing what is necessary to form a national unity government during the current crisis could leave him without a coalition after the shooting stops in a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing?

The number of soldiers who showed up for reserve duty in the first 48 hours, at 300,000, is 150% of the number who have been called up. The networks of the protest movement, which previously served to organize demonstrations against the judicial reform, were repurposed to collect food and equipment to ensure that Israel’s soldiers have what they need and more. <a href=\"https://x.com/YairGolan1/status/1711236922306171209?s=20\">Private citizens</a>, including former generals, took heroic actions of their own accord in order to save countless individuals early on in the fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel is now set to deliver a punishing blow to Hamas, but whether fighting will spread to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, or Yemen, is difficult to foresee. For a moment, all the damage Netanyahu has done to the country’s internal cohesion and image abroad has been set aside – but this should hardly be mistaken for an extension of his political lifespan. Once the fighting ends, Israel will likely toss out its flawed strategy for the Palestinian arena based on the previous conception of Hamas along with the premier who was seduced into complacency by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?&nbsp; Send it to <a href=\"mailto:Editor@thecipherbrief.com\">Editor@thecipherbrief.com</a> for publication consideration.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">The Cipher Brief</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/why-hamass-attack-will-change-israel-as-we-know-it\">Why Hamas&#8217;s Attack Will Change Israel As We Know It</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/why-hamass-attack-will-change-israel-as-we-know-it/feed","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Why Did Israeli Intelligence Fail?

We will not have a definitive answer to this question for quite a while, but you can be certain that Israel will engage in a deep and agonizing study of this &#8212; as it did after the failure in 1973 to anticipate the attack by Egypt and Syria in the Yom Kippur war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, we can think about this in the context of history and of past intelligence failures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we look closely at them, intelligence failures are almost always more complicated than people expect.&nbsp; So, we should not be surprised to eventually discover that this one may have involved many of the things I mention below – not just a single cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common cause is simply seeing the adversary as too weak to attack, or not bold enough to risk a loss against a stronger force. This was one factor at work when Israel in 1973 was surprised by the Syrian and Egyptian attacks. Israel had proven itself strong and dominant in the 1967 Six Day War in which Israel routed the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan and crippled their air forces. Israelis assumed Syria and Egypt would know they were not strong enough to prevail, and therefore would not risk war. But through the eyes of Syria and Egypt, who led the 1973 attack, it was worth the risk just to show their publics and the broader Arab world that they were not permanently defeated or beaten down. They didn’t have to win; they just had to show they could still try, and not suffer catastrophic defeat, in order to improve their position and bring the Arab world more firmly behind them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some element of this was probably involved in the current situation.&nbsp; The Israelis no doubt understand the dangers Hamas presents but probably did not imagine that it could carry out the kind of multi-front attack Hamas just mounted, involving missiles, drones, raids on Israeli cities, paragliders, street fighting deep inside Israel, kidnapping, and maritime attack. It is always difficult to anticipate something that an adversary is doing <em>for the very first time</em> and that exceeds all the capabilities it has demonstrated in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are parallels here with the American failure to foresee the 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam, in which the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong did something <em>they</em> had never done before and which the U.S. military, convinced of enemy weakness, thought they were incapable of – – infiltrating without detection, invading into the hearts of cities nationwide, and attacking the American embassy – all in a carefully planned and highly coordinated way. And there is another aspect of Tet that Israel has to be mindful of, which is that the American and South Vietnamese militaries decisively defeated the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, but the enemy nevertheless came away with a decisive psychological victory that affected the outcome of the war &#8212; simply by surprising the world’s greatest military and intelligence power. Hamas has just brought off a Middle East version of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor contributing to failure is that the victim’s attention is often focused elsewhere. Here there may be parallel to both Vietnam and the American failure to anticipate the attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941. In both cases United States thought the enemy was focused elsewhere. In Vietnam, many thought, the North Vietnamese objective was to defeat the northern U.S. Marine combat base at Khe Sanh which was under a heavy siege, that in some respects appeared similar to the successful Vietnamese siege of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. And in 1941, the United States expected the Japanese to attack in Asia at locations such as the Philippines and assumed they were not strong enough or bold enough to attack the US directly. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members have access to their own <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">Open Source Daily Brief</a>, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security.  It pays to be a <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Subscriber+Member</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Some such attitudes may have been at play in Israel.&nbsp; Even though Israeli intelligence closely monitors Hamas, it appears recently to have been heavily focused on the West Bank. Another, perhaps critical, distraction has been that Israel’s attention has been riveted on an unprecedented domestic political conflict under the Netanyahu government’s policies. At least one military official has said it was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-judicial-overhaul.html\">negatively affecting military preparedness.</a>&nbsp; This may have been a factor in what many civilians are lamenting was a slow response by Israeli Defense Forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is always the role of deception.&nbsp; The United States failed to catch the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, partly because it interpreted Soviet movements as maneuvers rather than preparations to invade.&nbsp; This played a role also in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein told his FBI interrogator that of course he wanted the world to think he had WMD – as a deterrent to regional enemies such as Iran and global adversaries such as the United States and Europe. Chances are Israel saw Hamas movements that with hindsight will appear clearly as preparation for what occurred but which Tel Aviv interpreted in recent weeks as maneuver &#8212; especially if the Israeli mindset was that Hamas would never be able to carry out the combined arms attacks we’ve just witnessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deception is especially powerful when combined with communications discipline by an adversary.&nbsp; Case in point: the Cuban Missile Crisis.&nbsp; The United States did not detect the Soviet placement of missiles in Cuba until U-2 reconnaissance flights in &nbsp;October 1962, in part because the Soviets did not discuss this in electronic communications, instead doing all of their planning on paper.&nbsp; Signals intelligence can be extraordinarily effective – unless an enemy simply goes silent.&nbsp; We may learn that Hamas did just that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes intelligence services sense something terrible is about to happen but lack concrete hard evidence to make the case in a way that spurs policymakers to act – especially when the latter have other resource and political demands that may seem more compelling or actionable at that moment.&nbsp; This was to some degree a factor in the 9/11 surprise in the U.S..&nbsp; The CIA in the summer of 2001 saw a huge spike in threat reporting, along with other worrisome indications, and was convinced a big attack was coming – the “lights were blinking red” in the words of then CIA Director George Tenet. But the Agency lacked hard data on the timing, method, and specific target of the attack.&nbsp; We may eventually learn that Israeli intelligence smelled danger but lacked the specific and compelling data often required to galvanize policy level action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most insidious causes of intelligence failure is what Roberta Wohlstetter, in her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Wohlstetter\">classic book on Pearl Harbor</a>, called the “signals to noise” problem – meaning that sometimes the indications of attack may be small in number and hidden in a huge volume of reporting. This becomes more problematic if there are any database errors or mistakes in sharing information. Such issues have come to light in some U.S misses, such as the failure in 2009 to detect the <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/DF-2011-00039.pdf#page=17&amp;zoom=auto,-114,148\">nearly successful attempt</a> of a Nigerian recruit to al-Qaeda to bring down an American aircraft over Detroit.&nbsp; An Israeli investigation may turn up some of these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there is almost always someone in the system who will say afterward that they tried to warn but couldn’t get their message through.&nbsp; When I arrived as a junior US Army intelligence officer in Vietnam in early 1969, officers in my unit at Bien Hoa said they had warned U.S military HQs in Saigon that an offensive was coming but that this was unwelcome news to senior officers, who pushed lower-level warning aside because they were convinced the U.S. was winning and that the enemy was weak and off balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, don’t be surprised if in some future review in Israel, someone comes forward to say “I told them so”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Send it to <a href=\"mailto:Editor@thecipherbrief.com\">Editor@thecipherbrief.com</a> for publication consideration.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in <a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\">The Cipher Brief</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/why-did-israeli-intelligence-fail-history-suggests-many-causes\">Why Did Israeli Intelligence Fail?

There are no gaps.  Everyone is focused on winning this war. “Ukrainians have no way out, we will continue to fight,” is what many told me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Military, parliamentarians and the local population are all exhausted, physically, and mentally.  There is no rest after 18 months of combat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current War Fight</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine’s military has adapted quickly, which enhances their chances for success.&nbsp; But so have the Russians. We must not underestimate Russia&#8217;s military capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the modern technology, success in trench warfare is where progress is measured. Enhanced technology in the close fight is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine is now a world leader in drone warfare and is becoming a global center of excellence for drone warfare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines are fighting on the battlefield in two styles: one NATO/western and the other, the old Soviet style.&nbsp; This is a problem.&nbsp; Many senior officers have previously trained in Soviet style warfare.&nbsp; They know of no other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The battlefield in Ukraine is an invaluable laboratory for future warfare.&nbsp; The U.S. must have a process to capture these valuable lessons in Ukraine and not attempt to do it from a distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>F-16s are not a silver bullet to a victory but they can provide an edge by interdicting Russian Close Air Support and defending Ukraine’s territorial boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Read <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/fine-print/the-future-of-cyberwar-is-being-shaped-in-ukraine\">The Future of Cyberwar is being Shaped in Ukraine</a> by Cipher Brief Senior National Security Columnist Walter Pincus</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Manning</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recruiting around the country continues to be a challenge while maintaining the initial, intermediate, and advanced base of education for Ukraine’s military.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veterans who were discharged from the military many years ago, have been pressed into service for the current fight and are serving on the front lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your life depends on adaptability, learning quickly, and innovation, much is accomplished.&nbsp; That is why Ukraine’s training on NATO-provided equipment can and should be accelerated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maintain &amp; Sustain</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently little progress being made toward maintaining donated equipment on the battlefield. &nbsp;Fixing damaged equipment today is a concept, not a reality.

And if so, with what Consequences?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>OPINION / EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> &#8212; Since early on in the Ukraine war, practically every Western leader has said that this war marks an “inflection point” in world affairs &#8212; a turning point, a tectonic shift, or moment of transition from one era to another. I think we all sense that … but what does this mean and is it really true? And if it is, what does it tell us about the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are not many things in modern history that rise to such status.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 20th century, World War I would surely qualify as an inflection point, given that it was marked by the collapse of two empires – the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman – and the emergence of many new countries, including the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>World War II also has to make the cut, because it ushered in new institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund, along with decolonization, the European unification drive, and seventy years of global tensions during the Cold War.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, were other dramatic moments that certainly brought sweeping changes but arguably not of the magnitude of the two world wars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States homeland had transformational impact on U.S. national security policy and alliance relations, elements of which endure after more than twenty years – but still of lesser scope than the World Wars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is it about Ukraine that has so many people talking “inflection point”?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, there is the sheer surprise and shock of it. In most minds – Western minds at least – this sort of thing was not supposed to happen again, that is, a full-scale invasion of one major country by another in the heart of Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that almost no one, including the Ukrainians, believed it when U.S. intelligence predicted it would happen. So, Putin’s attack redefined the concept of threat among those who were wary of Russia but assumed Putin’s style was more careful, stealthy, and incremental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, there are all the widely-discussed changes that came in the wake of the war – Finland and Sweden joining NATO, Germany and Japan adopting more robust national security policies after 75 years of caution and restraint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the increased volatility of oil prices, food shortages, and the division globally between those who condemn Russia and those such as China, India and many other countries that remain focused on their own problems, blame both sides, or, like China, walk a fine line – simultaneously deploring the violence but offering at least rhetorical support to Russia. That’s enough to say that the war is having at least as much impact on global dynamics as the 9/11 attacks and possibly more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another big factor shaping the feeling that everything could change fundamentally.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the nagging fear that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is finally serious about forcefully integrating Taiwan into China in the near term, with all the attendant dilemmas this would pose for the U.S. and Asian allies who have pledged to oppose this.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing?

What if some concatenation of events, accidents, and miscalculations pulls NATO and the U.S. more directly into conflict with Russia? What if Xi moves on Taiwan while the U.S. is still preoccupied with Russia’s aggression? What if that pulls in Asian allies at just the moment that the Ukraine war becomes more demanding on European partners?&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, what if there is a partisan-driven change of administration in the U.S. in the midst of all this? If that all happened, it would indeed start to feel like a major discontinuity in international affairs, in which another global conflict would not be unimaginable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that is predictable of course, and most analysts would hesitate to say it is probable. But most would probably also say the chances are not zero.&nbsp; It is this ‘hard-to-articulate’ sense of looming catastrophe that contributes to the conviction that we are now standing at one of those watershed moments in modern history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In wondering whether the Ukraine war will really upend things, here is a key question to ask: what are the possible counterreactions to the reactions we’ve seen so far?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking back to times at CIA when we were surprised by something (often then charged with “intelligence failure”) the origins of surprise sometimes came in barely-noticed incremental changes. These are the small, hard-to-see shifts whose significance is obscured until they achieve the critical mass necessary to plainly reveal a major change. In other words, a surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, here are two areas that merit special attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One has to do with the way the Ukraine war has altered calculations about nuclear weapons. Nuclear weaponry has been a constant in international affairs for decades but in recent years, we’ve not witnessed the big nuclear ‘scares’ that were an ever-present possibility during the Cold War. However, Putin’s nuclear threats during the war have forced everyone to think anew about the dangers that nuclear weapons pose.&nbsp; War with nukes is still the ultimate nightmare. And it can become more likely, the more nuclear weapons spread.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief hosts expert-level briefings on national security issues for <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Subscriber+Members</a> that help provide context around today’s national security issues and what they mean for business.&nbsp; Upgrade your status to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Subscriber+</a> today.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In that regard, it cannot be lost on many countries that if Ukraine had kept the nuclear weapons stationed on its soil when the USSR collapsed (Kyiv gave up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/science/ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html\">5,000 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons</a> in 1994, under an agreement among Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.), Putin might have thought twice before launching his war.&nbsp; To date, there are no signs that Ukraine is moving to build nuclear weapons. And although some experts call rumors of this ‘<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/ukraine-building-a-nuclear-bomb-dangerous-nonsense/\">dangerous nonsense</a>’, an end to the war is still not in sight. If it does not end in a way that gives Ukraine total confidence in its future security, it’s hard to believe Ukraine would not consider regaining a nuclear arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine’s plight must also be causing policy debates in other countries with worries about their future security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran’s neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, have to confront the reality that Tehran is now at nuclear “break out”; early this year, a senior <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/politics/kahl-iran-nuclear-deal/index.html\">Pentagon official said</a> Iran was 12 days away from having enough enriched material for a bomb. And in 2018, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43419673#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia%20has%20warned%20that%20it%20will%20develop,follow%20suit%20as%20soon%20as%20possible%2C%22%20he%20added.\">plainly said</a> Riyadh would “follow suit” if Tehran succeeded in acquiring the bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Asia, Japan and South Korea must be impressed that China is likely by 2030, to more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/china-military-nuclear.html\">triple its nuclear weapons force</a> (to about 1,000) at a moment of great political uncertainty in the U.S. and therefore about Washington’s fidelity to “extended deterrence” &#8212; that is, provision of its protective ‘nuclear umbrella’. (It is almost impossible to exaggerate the anxiety expressed by foreign counterparts regarding the political turmoil they now see in the U.S. and the weakening effect that worry could have on long-standing U.S. commitments.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second development with potential to inject new currents of surprise into international affairs, is the hardening of opposing alliances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the US side, the tightening of NATO is by now obvious but just coming into view is a comparable tightening of U.S. ties with key Asian partners. This was most recently visible in a new <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/biden-japan-south-korea-summit.html\">tripartite security pact</a> between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, in which the three countries pledged to set up a crisis “hotline” and to cooperate more closely on missile defense and in joint military exercises. This is remarkable when set against the long history of suspicion and tension between South Korea and Japan tracing back to WW II. China has already <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-japan-south-korea-6c626a246219c6dc3915ed8a18f34c74\">blasted the pact</a> and my guess is we will see an increase in Sino-Russian military exercises in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mirroring this among the autocracies of the world&nbsp;is the growing cooperation the Ukraine war is stimulating among Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. These four countries are drawing together across the board, driven by opposition to US global preeminence and the sanctioning power of the U.S. dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Subscriber+Members have a higher level of access to Cipher Brief Expert Perspectives and get exclusive access to <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/dead-drop\">The Dead Drop</a>, the best national security gossip publication, if we do say so ourselves.&nbsp; Find out what you’re missing. <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus\">Upgrade your access to Subscriber+ now</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Tangible cooperation is most apparent in the weapons trade that Russia has initiated with North Korea and Iran.

It’s only logical to ask what Tehran and Pyongyang might seek in return for such assistance. One obvious quid pro quo is Russia’s help with the nuclear and missile programs of both countries.&nbsp; CIA Director William Burns has already <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-offering-iran-missile-program-help-exchange-weapons-ukraine-cia-2023-2#:~:text=Russia%20has%20turned%20to%20isolated%20nations%20for%20support,China%20may%20be%20planning%20to%20give%20Russia%20weapons.\">noted signs of Russian assistance</a> to Iran’s missile program. Russian assistance could enable the Iranian program to finally gain success with longer range missiles, including an intercontinental capability that has long eluded Iranian engineers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, some aspects of the Ukraine war have brought into closer alignment, the tangible interests of these four autocratic countries. These are likely to tighten the longer the war persists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third global alignment that is changing involves the grouping of nations called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brics.asp#:~:text=BRICS%20was%20created%20by%20Goldman%20Sachs%20as%20an,seeking%20to%20further%20economic%20ties%20with%20each%20other.\">BRICS</a> &#8212; Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. It took shape between 2001 and 2006, to increase economic cooperation and political clout among the five countries.&nbsp; Now, about 40 other countries are seeking to join, although only Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/24/five-brics-nations-announce-admission-of-six-new-countries-to-bloc\">were accepted</a> at the group’s meeting earlier this month.&nbsp; This is a big win for Russia and China both of whom have been pushing to make the group larger as a counterweight to what they see as a U.S.-dominated global order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expansion is another offshoot of the Ukraine war insofar as the surge of interest in BRICS represents opposition to the East-West split that the war has crystalized – and opposition to the dominance of the U.S. dollar and the power that gives the U.S. to sanction other countries. For now, BRICS expansion is mainly of symbolic importance, but key countries that desire a global order less driven by the U.S. – especially Russia, China, and India – have every incentive to try translating it into concrete power. One tactic would be <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/22/can-brics-create-a-new-world-order\">voting together</a> more often in forums such as the UN and the International Monetary Fund. At minimum, BRICS expansion shows that broadly-shared <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brics-summit-divergent-interests-undermine-impact-by-ana-palacio-2023-08?barrier=accesspaylog\">grievances with the current global order</a>, offers Russia another way to limit its diplomatic isolation, and gives China an arena in which to push for changes to the status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, whether or not the Ukraine war turns out to be the global inflection point many leaders foresee, it has already had a powerful impact on key aspects of what is commonly understood to comprise global order – especially thinking about nuclear weapons and the composition and direction of alliances and other international groupings. The question of whether these trends continue to evolve and mature has an unsatisfactory answer: it depends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, it depends on how and in what circumstances the Ukraine war ends.&nbsp; A war that grinds on or coincides with major conflict elsewhere or with a major political change in the United States, would probably open up a period of inconclusive maneuvering among all of the forces I’ve discussed here. If, on the other hand, Ukraine succeeds in expelling Russia, there is a good chance we will see regime change in Moscow, a loss of momentum among autocracies, and a recalibration of strategies in many of the arenas I’ve discussed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, tectonic plates are moving in global politics. The only question is how they will settle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have a perspective to share based on your experience in national security?&nbsp; Send it to </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:Editor@thecipherbrief.com\"><strong><em>Editor@thecipherbrief.com</em></strong></a><strong><em> for publication consideration.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.thecipherbrief.com/\"><strong><em>The Cipher Brief</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-driving-a-new-global-order\">How the War in Ukraine is Driving a New Global Order</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com\">The Cipher Brief</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-driving-a-new-global-order/feed","slash:comments":"0"}]}}}
