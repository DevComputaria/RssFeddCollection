On the other hand, DAST implements a black-box testing method, where security engineers parse simulated attack payloads through the application’s front end without exposing internal information on the application’s internal construct.  \nIn this blog, we will discuss SAST and DAST testing approaches, how they help detect vulnerabilities and application failures, their differences, and best use cases. \nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST) \nSAST…",

Just like financial debt, security debt accrues when organizations compromise security measures in favor of convenience, speed, or cost-cutting measures. Over time, this accumulated debt can pose serious risks to the organization's data, reputation, and overall stability. However, with a strategic approach and a commitment to proactive security practices, organizations can effectively reduce their security debt. In this blog post, we will explore the art of reducing security debt in three key steps, enabling organizations to strengthen their security posture and safeguard their valuable assets.\n \nStep 1: Assess and Prioritize Security Risks \n \nThe first step in reducing security debt is to conduct a thorough assessment of your organization's security risks. This involves identifying vulnerabilities, evaluating existing security…",

Sharing stories of women who have broken barriers in STEM is a reminder of what can be achieved when equity is embraced. As Scientific American writes, “...the findings are clear: for groups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps.” Let’s take a moment to honor some brilliant individuals who have made it possible for more diverse voices to be heard in STEM industries – from one of the first women in STEM until now.  \nElisa Leonida Zamfirescu \nIn 1912, before women in most countries could vote, Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu became one of the first women in the world to obtain a degree in engineering, inspiring generations of women who followed her. The World Record Academy quotes a newspaper from 1912 as follows: “In engineering, the future of women is great, Miss Elisa Leonida has passed the final exam with great success, obtaining the…",

Finally, in February 2023, the SnakeYAML 2.0 release was pushed that resolves this flaw, also referred to as CVE-2022-1471. Let’s break down how this version can help you resolve this critical flaw. \nExploring Deserialization \nSnakeYAML is a popular Java library to parse YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language format). The library can parse all YAML 1.1 specifications [1], native types [2] and supports serializing and deserializing Java objects. The Remote Code Execution vulnerability is due to the library not restricting Java types when deserializing objects using `Constructor`.\nJava Serialization has the great promise of taking the state of a full object graph and saving it externally, then magically restoring its state when we deserialize. This is a big promise as…",

Today's release of the Biden-Harris Administration's National Cybersecurity Strategy provides an extensive roadmap for impacting both public and private security efforts. In this blog post, we’ll take an in-depth look at three of the most software-related strategic objectives: software liability, open-source software usage, and cybersecurity workforce readiness. \nSoftware Liability Overview \nSoftware liability refers to the legal and financial responsibility of individuals or entities for any damages or losses caused by their software. This can include issues such as security vulnerabilities, bugs, or other defects that result in harm to users or their data.  \nThe National Cybersecurity Strategy states: “Poor software security greatly increases systemic risk across the digital ecosystem...

Using the right SAST tools at the right times, you can seamlessly integrate and scale security workflows throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). In this post, we’ll walk through examples of how easily you can work with Veracode’s SAST tools for first-party and third-party code scanning when using Azure DevOps and Visual Studio – and the different plugins available. \nTicket Follow Up \nLet’s start where all developers’ workdays begin: the ticketing system. In this scenario, it’s the Azure DevOps Workboard, and the idea is that you have run a SAST policy scan. A Veracode policy scan effectively tests at the integration or systems level. Through integration, the tool can automatically generate security bug tickets inside of Azure DevOps based on scan results.  \n\nFrom the ticket…",

It bundles an application’s code together with the related configuration files and libraries, and with the dependencies required for the application to run. This allows you to deploy cloud-native applications seamlessly across public, hybrid, or private cloud environments. \nFor example, just as shipping industries use physical containers to isolate different cargos—for example, to transport in ships and trains regardless of the cargo inside—containers also work in this way as they help us ship self-contained units of…",

Running a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan will help highlight dependencies and any issues in the OSS libraries being used. Here's six reasons why scanning OSS dependencies while you code helps in the long run. \n1. Save Yourself from Agitation Later  \nThe longer you wait for security checks, the harder they will be to fix later.

We dug into 17 years of data and analyzed three-quarters of a million applications to provide security and development teams with concrete steps they can act on together to minimize risk, protect applications, and meet industry regulations. Plus, we turn some conventional wisdom about open source on its head. Let’s dive in. \n1. 32 percent of apps contain security flaws at the first scan, and by the five-year mark, this jumps to 70 percent. \nBy the time they move into production, nearly one-third of all applications have security flaws, and applications grow by about 40 percent year on year irrespective of their…",
