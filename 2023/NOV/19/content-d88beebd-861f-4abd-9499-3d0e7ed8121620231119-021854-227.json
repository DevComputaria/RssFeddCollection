In that breach, which occurred in October 2020, a hacker using the handle “Ransom Man” threatened to publish patient psychotherapy notes if Vastaamo did not pay a six-figure ransom demand.</p>\n<p>Vastaamo refused, so Ransom Man shifted to extorting individual patients — sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes unless paid a 500-euro ransom. When Ransom Man found little success extorting patients directly, they uploaded to the dark web a large compressed file containing all of the stolen Vastaamo patient records.</p>\n<p>Security experts soon discovered Ransom Man had mistakenly included an entire copy of their home folder, where investigators found many clues pointing to Kivimäki’s involvement. By that time, Kivimäki was no longer in Finland, but the Finnish government nevertheless <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/hacker-charged-with-extorting-online-psychotherapy-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charged Kivimäki in absentia with the Vastaamo hack</a>. The 2,200-page evidence document against Kivimäki suggests he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle while on the lam, frequenting luxury resorts and renting fabulously expensive cars and living quarters.</p>\n<p>But in February 2023, Kivimäki was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/finlands-most-wanted-hacker-nabbed-in-france/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrested in France</a> after authorities there responded to a domestic disturbance call and found the defendant sleeping off a hangover on the couch of a woman he&#8217;d met the night before. The French police grew suspicious when the 6&#8242; 3&#8243; blonde, green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65661\" style=\"width: 692px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65661\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-65661\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kivimaki-romainianid.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"682\" height=\"466\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65661\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A redacted copy of an ID Kivimaki gave to French authorities claiming he was from Romania.</p></div>\n<p>Finnish prosecutors showed that Kivimäki&#8217;s credit card had been used to pay for the virtual server that hosted the stolen Vastaamo patient notes. What&#8217;s more, the home folder included in the Vastaamo patient data archive also allowed investigators to peer into other cybercrime projects of the accused, including domains that Ransom Man had access to as well as a lengthy history of commands he&#8217;d executed on the rented virtual server.</p>\n<p>Some of those domains allegedly administered by Kivimäki were set up to smear the reputations of different companies and individuals. One of those was a website that claimed to have been authored by a person who headed up IT infrastructure for a major bank in Norway which discussed the idea of legalizing child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Another domain hosted a fake blog that besmirched the reputation of a Tulsa, Okla. man whose name was attached to blog posts about supporting the &#8220;white pride&#8221; movement and calling for a pardon of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh</a>.</p>\n<p>Kivimäki appears to have sought to sully the name of this reporter as well. The 2,200-page document shows that Kivimäki owned and operated the domain <strong>krebsonsecurity[.]org</strong>, which hosted various hacking tools that Kivimäki allegedly used, including programs for mass-scanning the Internet for systems vulnerable to known security flaws, as well as scripts for cracking database server usernames and passwords, and downloading databases.<span id=\"more-65630\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65662\" style=\"width: 654px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65662\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-65662\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kos-org-bash.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"644\" height=\"866\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65662\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ransom Man inadvertently included a copy of his home directory in the leaked Vastaamo patient data.

Traces are left in the digital world too, even if it is very tedious for the police to collect them from servers all around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Antti Kurittu</strong> is an information security specialist and a former criminal investigator. In 2013, Kurittu worked on an investigation involving Kivimäki’s use of the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/zeus-trojan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zbot botnet</a>, among other activities Kivimäki engaged in as a member of the hacker group <a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/25306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hack the Planet</a> (HTP). Kurittu said it remains to be seen if the prosecution can make their case, and if the defense has any answers to all of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the public pretrial investigation report, it looks like the case has a lot of details that seem very improbable to be coincidental,&#8221; Kurittu told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;For example, a full copy of the Vastaamo patient database was found on a server that belonged to Scanifi, a company with no reasonable business that Kivimäki was affiliated with. The leaked home folder contents were also connected to Kivimäki and were found on servers that were under his control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Finnish daily <em>yle.fi</em> <a href=\"https://yle.fi/a/74-20059985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> that Kivimäki&#8217;s lawyers sought to have their client released from confinement for the remainder of his trial, noting that the defendant has already been detained for eight months.</p>\n<p>The court denied that request, saying the defendant was still a flight risk. Kivimäki&#8217;s trial is expected to continue until February 2024, in part to accommodate testimony from a large number of victims. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year sentence for Kivimäki.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/11/alleged-extortioner-of-psychotherapy-patients-faces-trial/feed/","slash:comments":"15"},{"title":"Microsoft Patch Tuesday, November 2023 Edition","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2023-edition/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2023-edition/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 23:00:59 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Security Tools"},{"#cdata-section":"Time to Patch"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36025"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36033"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36036"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36038"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36050"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36413"},{"#cdata-section":"CVE-2023-36439"},{"#cdata-section":"Microsoft Patch Tuesday November 2023"},{"#cdata-section":"sans internet storm center"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=65633"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Microsoft today released updates to fix more than five dozen security holes in its Windows operating systems and related software, including three \"zero day\" vulnerabilities that Microsoft warns are already being exploited in active attacks."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to fix more than five dozen security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and related software, including three &#8220;zero day&#8221; vulnerabilities that Microsoft warns are already being exploited in active attacks.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-56287\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"841\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-768x541.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-782x550.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-100x70.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px\" /></p>\n<p>The zero-day threats targeting Microsoft this month include <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36025</a>, a weakness that allows malicious content to bypass the Windows SmartScreen Security feature. SmartScreen is a built-in Windows component that tries to detect and block malicious websites and files. Microsoft&#8217;s security advisory for this flaw says attackers could exploit it by getting a Windows user to click on a booby-trapped link to a shortcut file.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Breen</strong>, senior director of threat research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, said emails with .url attachments or logs with processes spawning from .url files &#8220;should be a high priority for threat hunters given the active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.&#8221;<span id=\"more-65633\"></span></p>\n<p>The second zero day this month is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36033</a>, which is a vulnerability in the &#8220;DWM Core Library&#8221; in Microsoft Windows that was exploited in the wild as a zero day and publicly disclosed prior to patches being available. It affects Microsoft Windows 10 and later, as well as Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and subsequent versions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This vulnerability can be exploited locally, with low complexity and without needing high-level privileges or user interaction,&#8221; said <strong>Mike Walters</strong>, president and co-founder of the security firm <strong>Action1</strong>. &#8220;Attackers exploiting this flaw could gain SYSTEM privileges, making it an efficient method for escalating privileges, especially after initial access through methods like phishing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The final zero day in this month&#8217;s Patch Tuesday is a problem in the &#8220;Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver&#8221; tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36036</a> that affects Windows 10 and later, as well as Windows Server 2008 at later. Microsoft says it is relatively straightforward for attackers to exploit CVE-2023-36036 as a way to elevate their privileges on a compromised PC.</p>\n<p>Beyond the zero day flaws, Breen said organizations running <strong>Microsoft Exchange Server</strong> should prioritize several new Exchange patches, including <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36439</a>, which is a bug that would allow attackers to install malicious software on an Exchange server. This weakness technically requires the attacker to be authenticated to the target&#8217;s local network, but Breen notes that a pair of phished Exchange credentials will provide that access nicely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is typically achieved through social engineering attacks with spear phishing to gain initial access to a host before searching for other vulnerable internal targets – just because your Exchange Server doesn&#8217;t have internet-facing authentication doesn’t mean it&#8217;s protected,&#8221; Breen said.</p>\n<p>Breen said this vulnerability goes hand in hand with three other Exchange bugs that Microsoft designated as &#8220;exploitation more likely:&#8221; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36050</a>, <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36039</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36035\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2023-36035</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong> <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20November%202023/30400/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">points to</a> two additional bugs patched by Microsoft this month that aren&#8217;t yet showing signs of active exploitation but that were made public prior to today and thus deserve prioritization.

Attempts to log in to my account directly at Experian.com also failed; the site said it didn&#8217;t recognize my username and/or password.</p>\n<p>A request for my Experian account username required my full Social Security number and date of birth, after which the website displayed portions of an email address I never authorized and did not recognize (the full address was redacted by Experian).</p>\n<p>I immediately suspected that Experian was still allowing anyone to recreate their credit file account using the same personal information but a different email address, a major authentication failure that was explored in last year&#8217;s story, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/experian-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Experian, You Have Some Explaining to Do</a>. So once again I sought to re-register as myself at Experian.</p>\n<p>The homepage said I needed to provide a Social Security number and mobile phone number, and that I&#8217;d soon receive a link that I should click to verify myself. The site claims that the phone number you provide will be used to help validate your identity. But it appears you could supply any phone number in the United States at this stage in the process, and Experian&#8217;s website would not balk. <em>Regardless, users can simply skip this step by selecting the option to &#8220;Continue another way.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Experian then asks for your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, email address and chosen password. After that, they require you to successfully answer between three to five multiple-choice security questions whose answers are very often based on public records. When I recreated my account this week, only two of the five questions pertained to my real information, and both of those questions concerned street addresses we&#8217;ve previously lived at &#8212; information that is just a Google search away.</p>\n<p>Assuming you sail through the multiple-choice questions, you&#8217;re prompted to create a 4-digit PIN and provide an answer to one of several pre-selected challenge questions. After that, your new account is created and you&#8217;re directed to the Experian dashboard, which allows you to view your full credit file, and freeze or unfreeze it.</p>\n<p>At this point, Experian will send a message to the old email address tied to the account, saying certain aspects of the user profile have changed. But this message isn&#8217;t a request seeking verification: It&#8217;s just a notification from Experian that the account&#8217;s user data has changed, and the original user is offered zero recourse here other than to a click a link to log in at Experian.com.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65605\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65605\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-65605\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/expupdates.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"707\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you don&#8217;t have an Experian account, it&#8217;s a good idea to create one.

Nor do their PIN or account recovery question, because those have been changed also. Your only option at this point is recreate your account at Experian and steal it back from the ID thieves!</p>\n<p>In contrast, if you try to modify an existing account at either of the other two major consumer credit reporting bureaus &#8212; <strong>Equifax</strong> or <strong>TransUnion</strong> &#8212; they will ask you to enter a code sent to the email address or phone number on file before any changes can be made.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, Experian declined to share the full email address that was added without authorization to my credit file.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To ensure the protection of consumers’ identities and information, we have implemented a multi-layered security approach, which includes passive and active measures, and are constantly evolving,&#8221; Experian spokesperson <strong>Scott Anderson</strong> said in an emailed statement. &#8220;This includes knowledge-based questions and answers, and device possession and ownership verification processes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anderson said all consumers have the option to activate a multi-factor authentication method that&#8217;s requested each time they log in to their account. But what good is multi-factor authentication if someone can simply recreate your account with a new phone number and email address?<span id=\"more-65594\"></span></p>\n<p>Several readers who spotted <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111383547431806668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my rant about Experian on Mastodon</a> earlier this week responded to a request to validate my findings.

As detailed in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/11/russian-reshipping-service-swat-usa-drop-exposed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Nov. 2 story</a>, SWAT currently employs more than 1,200 U.S. residents, all of whom will be cut loose without a promised payday at the end of their first month reshipping stolen goods.</p>\n<p>The current co-owner of SWAT, a cybercriminal who uses the nickname &#8220;Fearlless,&#8221; operates primarily on the cybercrime forum <strong>Verified</strong>. This Russian-language forum has tens of thousands of members, and it has suffered several hacks that exposed more than a decade&#8217;s worth of user data and direct messages.</p>\n<p>January 2021 posts on Verified show that Fearlless and his partner <strong>Universalo</strong> purchased the SWAT reshipping business from a Verified member named SWAT, who&#8217;d been operating the service for years. SWAT agreed to transfer the business in exchange for 30 percent of the net profit over the ensuing six months.</p>\n<p>Cyber intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.intel471.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intel 471</a> says Fearlless first registered on Verified in February 2013. The email address Fearlless used on Verified leads nowhere, but a review of Fearlless&#8217; direct messages on Verified indicates this user originally registered on Verified a year earlier as a reshipping vendor, under the alias &#8220;<strong>Apathyp</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are two clues supporting the conclusion that Apathyp and Fearlless are the same person. First, the Verified administrators warned Apathyp he had violated the forum&#8217;s rules barring the use of multiple accounts by the same person, and that Verified&#8217;s automated systems had detected that Apathyp and Fearlless were logging in from the same device.  Second, in his earliest private messages on Verified, Fearlless told others to contact him on an instant messenger address that Apathyp had claimed as his.<span id=\"more-65541\"></span></p>\n<p>Intel 471 says Apathyp registered on Verified using the email address <strong>triploo@mail.ru</strong>. A search on that email address at the breach intelligence service <a href=\"https://www.constellaintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Constella Intelligence</a> found that a password commonly associated with it was &#8220;<strong>niceone</strong>.&#8221; But the triploo@mail.ru account isn&#8217;t connected to much else that&#8217;s interesting except a now-deleted account at <strong>Vkontakte</strong>, the Russian answer to Facebook.</p>\n<p>However, in Sept. 2020, Apathyp sent a private message on Verified to the owner of a stolen credit card shop, saying his credentials no longer worked. Apathyp told the proprietor that his chosen password on the service was &#8220;<strong>12Apathy</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A search on that password at Constella reveals it was used by just four different email addresses, two of which are particularly interesting: <strong>gezze@yandex.ru </strong>and <strong>gezze@mail.ru</strong>. Constella discovered that both of these addresses were previously associated with the same password as triploo@mail.ru &#8212; &#8220;niceone,&#8221; or some variation thereof.</p>\n<p>Constella found that years ago gezze@mail.ru was used to create a Vkontakte account under the name <strong>Ivan Sherban</strong> (former password: &#8220;<strong>12niceone</strong>&#8220;) from Magnitogorsk, an industrial city in the southern region of Russia. That same email address is now tied to a Vkontakte account for an Ivan Sherban who lists his home as Saint Petersburg, Russia. Sherban&#8217;s profile photo <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gezze.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shows</a> a heavily tattooed, muscular and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gezze-car.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently married</a> individual with his beautiful new bride getting ready to drive off in a convertible sports car.</p>\n<p>A pivotal clue for validating the research into Apathyp/Fearlless came from the identity intelligence firm <a href=\"https://mynetwatchman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">myNetWatchman</a>, which found that gezze@mail.ru at one time used the passwords &#8220;<strong>геззи1991</strong>&#8221; (gezze1991) and &#8220;<strong>gezze18081991</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Care to place a wager on when Vkontakte says is Mr. Sherban&#8217;s birthday?

Here&#8217;s a closer look at the Russia-based <strong>SWAT USA Drop Service</strong>, which currently employs more than 1,200 people across the United States who are knowingly or unwittingly involved in reshipping expensive consumer goods purchased with stolen credit cards.</p>\n<p>Among the most common ways that thieves extract cash from stolen credit card accounts is through purchasing pricey consumer goods online and reselling them on the black market. Most online retailers grew wise to these scams years ago and stopped shipping to regions of the world most frequently associated with credit card fraud, including Eastern Europe, North Africa, and Russia.</p>\n<p>But such restrictions have created a burgeoning underground market for reshipping scams, which rely on willing or unwitting residents in the United States and Europe to receive stolen goods and relay them to crooks living in the embargoed areas.</p>\n<p>Services like SWAT are known as “Drops for stuff” on cybercrime forums. The “<strong>drops</strong>” are people who have responded to work-at-home package reshipping jobs advertised on craigslist.com and job search sites. Most reshipping scams promise employees a monthly salary and even cash bonuses. In reality, the crooks in charge almost always stop communicating with drops just before the first payday, usually about a month after the drop ships their first package.</p>\n<p>The packages arrive with prepaid shipping labels that are paid for with stolen credit card numbers, or with <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/08/white-label-money-laundering-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hijacked online accounts at FedEx and the US Postal Service</a>. Drops are responsible for inspecting and verifying the contents of shipments, attaching the correct shipping label to each package, and sending them off via the appropriate shipping company.</p>\n<p>SWAT takes a percentage cut (up to 50 percent) where &#8220;<strong>stuffers</strong>&#8221; &#8212; thieves armed with stolen credit card numbers &#8212; pay a portion of each product’s retail value to SWAT as the reshipping fee. The stuffers use stolen cards to purchase high-value products from merchants and have the merchants ship the items to the drops’ address. Once the drops receive and successfully reship the stolen packages, the stuffers then sell the products on the local black market.</p>\n<p>The SWAT drop service has been around in various names and under different ownership for almost a decade. But in early October 2023, SWAT&#8217;s current co-owner &#8212; a Russian-speaking individual who uses the handle &#8220;<strong>Fearlless</strong>&#8221; &#8212; took to his favorite cybercrime forum to lodge a formal complaint against the owner of a competing reshipping service, alleging his rival had hacked SWAT and was trying to poach his stuffers and reshippers by emailing them directly.<span id=\"more-65479\"></span></p>\n<p>Milwaukee-based security firm <a href=\"https://www.holdsecurity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hold Security</a> shared recent screenshots of a working SWAT stuffer&#8217;s user panel, and those images show that SWAT currently lists more than 1,200 drops in the United States that are available for stuffers to rent. The contact information for <strong>Kareem</strong>, a young man from Maryland, was listed as an active drop. Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, Kareem agreed to speak on condition that his full name not be used in this story.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65513\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65513\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-65513\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule.png 1654w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule-768x398.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule-1536x797.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule-782x406.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/swatship-rule-267x140.png 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A SWAT panel for stuffers/customers.

Kareem was less than thrilled to learn he would probably not be getting his salary on the promised payday, which was coming up in a few days.</p>\n<p>Kareem said he was instructed to create an account at a website called <strong>portal-ctsi[.]com</strong>, where each day he was expected to log in and check for new messages about pending shipments.

In practice, all drops are cut loose within approximately 30 days of their first shipment — just before the promised paycheck is due. Because of this constant churn, each stuff shop operator must be constantly recruiting new drops. Also, with this distributed setup, even if one reshipping operation gets shut down (or exposed online), the rest can keep on pumping out dozens of packages a day.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ccsfp155-haoA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2015 academic study</a> (PDF) on criminal reshipping services found the average financial hit from a reshipping scheme per cardholder was $1,156.93. That study looked into the financial operations of several reshipping schemes, and estimated that approximately 1.6 million credit and debit cards are used to commit at least $1.8 billion in reshipping fraud each year.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see how reshipping can be a profitable enterprise for card crooks. For example, a stuffer buys a stolen payment card off the black market for $10, and uses that card to purchase more than $1,100 worth of goods. After the reshipping service takes its cut (~$550), and the stuffer pays for his reshipping label (~$100), the stuffer receives the stolen goods and sells them on the black market in Russia for $1,400. He has just turned a $10 investment into more than $700. Rinse, wash, and repeat.</p>\n<p>The breach at SWAT exposed not only the nicknames and contact information for all of its stuffers and drops, but also the group&#8217;s monthly earnings and payouts.

The findings come close on the heels of a report that identified .US domains as among the most prevalent in phishing attacks over the past year.</p>\n<p>Researchers at <strong>Infoblox</strong> say they&#8217;ve been tracking what appears to be a three-year-old link shortening service that is catering to phishers and malware purveyors. Infoblox found the domains involved are typically three to seven characters long, and hosted on bulletproof hosting providers that charge a premium to ignore any abuse or legal complaints. The short domains don&#8217;t host any content themselves, but are used to obfuscate the real address of landing pages that try to phish users or install malware.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65459\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65459\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-65459\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ppuma.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ppuma.png 892w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ppuma-768x526.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ppuma-782x536.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ppuma-100x70.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A graphic describing the operations of a malicious link shortening service that Infoblox has dubbed &#8220;Prolific Puma.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>Infoblox says it&#8217;s unclear how the phishing and malware landing pages tied to this service are being initially promoted, although they suspect it is mainly through scams targeting people on their phones via SMS. A new report says the company mapped the contours of this link shortening service thanks in part to pseudo-random patterns in the short domains, which all appear on the surface to be a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This came to our attention because we have systems that detect registrations that use domain name generation algorithms,&#8221; said <strong>Renee Burton</strong>, head of threat intelligence at Infoblox. &#8220;We have not found any legitimate content served through their shorteners.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Infoblox determined that until May 2023, domains ending in .info accounted for the bulk of new registrations tied to the malicious link shortening service, which Infoblox has dubbed &#8220;<strong>Prolific Puma</strong>.&#8221; Since then, they found that whoever is responsible for running the service has used .US for approximately 55 percent of the total domains created, with several dozen new malicious .US domains registered daily.</p>\n<p>.US is overseen by the <strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</strong> (NTIA), an executive branch agency of the <strong>U.S. Department of Commerce</strong>. But Uncle Sam has long outsourced the management of .US to various private companies, which have gradually allowed the United States&#8217;s top-level domain to devolve into a cesspool of phishing activity.</p>\n<p>Or so concludes <strong>The Interisle Consulting Group</strong>, which gathers phishing data from multiple industry sources and publishes an annual report on the latest trends. As far back as 2018, Interisle found .US domains were the worst in the world for spam, botnet (attack infrastructure for DDOS etc.) and illicit or harmful content.</p>\n<p>Interisle’s <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/why-is-us-being-used-to-phish-so-many-of-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newest study</a> examined six million phishing reports between May 1, 2022 and April 30, 2023, and identified approximately 30,000 .US phishing domains. Interisle found significant numbers of .US domains were registered to attack some of the United States’ most prominent companies, including Bank of America, Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, Citi, Comcast, Microsoft, Meta, and Target. Others were used to impersonate or attack U.S. government agencies.</p>\n<p>Under NTIA regulations, domain registrars processing .US domain registrations must take <a href=\"https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ustld2007_34_apph_nexus.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certain steps</a> (PDF) to verify that those customers actually reside in the United States, or else own organizations based in the U.S. However, if one registers a .US domain through GoDaddy &#8212; the largest domain registrar and the current administrator of the .US contract &#8212; the way one &#8220;proves&#8221; their U.S. nexus is simply by choosing from one of three pre-selected affirmative responses.</p>\n<p>In an age when most domain registrars are automatically redacting customer information from publicly accessible registration records to avoid running afoul of European privacy laws, .US has remained something of an outlier because its charter specifies that all registration records be made public. However, Infoblox said it found more than 2,000 malicious link shortener domains ending in .US registered since October 2023 through <strong>NameSilo</strong> that have somehow subverted the transparency requirements for the usTLD and converted to private registrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Through our own experience with NameSilo, it is not possible to select private registration for domains in the usTLD through their interface,&#8221; Infoblox wrote. &#8220;And yet, it was done. Of the total domains with private records, over 99% were registered with NameSilo. At this time, we are not able to explain this behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p>NameSilo CEO <strong>Kristaps Ronka</strong> said the company actively responds to reports about abusive domains, but that it hasn&#8217;t seen any abuse reports related to Infoblox&#8217;s findings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We take down hundreds to thousands of domains, lots of them proactively to combat abuse,&#8221; Ronka said. &#8220;Our current abuse rate on abuseIQ for example is currently at 0%. AbuseIQ receives reports from countless sources and we are yet to see these &#8216;Puma&#8217; abuse reports.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-65446\"></span></p>\n<p>Experts who track domains associated with malware and phishing say even phony information supplied at registration is useful in identifying potentially malicious or phishous domains before they can be used for abuse.</p>\n<p>For example, when it was registered through NameSilo in July 2023, the domain <strong>1ox[.]us</strong> &#8212; like thousands of others &#8212; listed its registrant as &#8220;<strong>Leila Puma</strong>&#8221; at a street address in Poland, and the email address <strong>blackpumaoct33@ukr.net</strong>. But according to <strong>DomainTools.com</strong>, on Oct. 1, 2023 those records were redacted and hidden by NameSilo.</p>\n<p>Infoblox notes that the username portion of the email address appears to be a reference to the song October 33 by the <a href=\"https://www.blackpumas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Pumas</a>, an Austin, Texas based psychedelic soul band. The Black Pumas aren&#8217;t exactly a household name, but they did recently have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Ap_7wjHls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a popular Youtube video</a> that featured a cover of the Kinks song &#8220;Strangers,&#8221; which included an emotional visual narrative about Ukrainians seeking refuge from the Russian invasion, titled &#8220;Ukraine Strangers.&#8221; Also, Leila Puma&#8217;s email address is at a Ukrainian email provider.</p>\n<p>DomainTools shows that hundreds of other malicious domains tied to Prolific Puma previously were registered through <strong>NameCheap</strong> to a &#8220;Josef Bakhovsky&#8221; at a different street address in Poland. According to <a href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=bakowski#:~:text=Bakowski%20Family%20History-,Bakowski%20Name%20Meaning,Compare%20Bonkowski%20.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ancestry.com</a>, the anglicized version of this surname &#8212; Bakovski &#8212; is the traditional name for someone from Bakowce, which is now known as Bakivtsi and is in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>This possible Polish and/or Ukrainian connection may or may not tell us something about the &#8220;who&#8221; behind this link shortening service, but those details are useful for identifying and grouping these malicious short domains. However, even this meager visibility into .US registration data is now under threat.</p>\n<p>The NTIA <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/01/2023-09180/introduction-of-accountable-measures-regarding-access-to-personal-information-of-us-registrants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently published a proposal</a> that would allow registrars to redact all registrant data from WHOIS registration records for .US domains. A broad array of industry groups have <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/docket/NTIA-2023-0006/comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filed comments opposing the proposed changes</a>, saying they threaten to remove the last vestiges of accountability for a top-level domain that is already overrun with cybercrime activity.</p>\n<p>Infoblox&#8217;s Burton says Prolific Puma is remarkable because they&#8217;ve been able to facilitate malicious activities for years while going largely unnoticed by the security industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This exposes how persistent the criminal economy can be at a supply chain level,&#8221; Burton said. &#8220;We&#8217;re always looking at the end malware or phishing page, but what we&#8217;re finding here is that there&#8217;s this middle layer of DNS threat actors persisting for years without notice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Infoblox&#8217;s full report on Prolific Puma is <a href=\"https://blogs.infoblox.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/prolific-puma-shadowy-link-shortening-service-enables-cybercrime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/us-harbors-prolific-malicious-link-shortening-service/feed/","slash:comments":"7"},{"title":"NJ Man Hired Online to Firebomb, Shoot at Homes Gets 13 Years in Prison","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/nj-man-hired-online-to-firebomb-shoot-at-homes-gets-13-years-in-prison/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/nj-man-hired-online-to-firebomb-shoot-at-homes-gets-13-years-in-prison/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 13:08:27 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"A Little Sunshine"},{"#cdata-section":"Ne'er-Do-Well News"},{"#cdata-section":"Patrick McGovern-Allen"},{"#cdata-section":"violence-as-a-service"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=65392"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"A 22-year-old New Jersey man has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for participating in a firebombing and a shooting at homes in Pennsylvania last year.

The threat actor was able to view files uploaded by certain Okta customers as part of recent support cases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Okta explained that when it is troubleshooting issues with customers it will often ask for a recording of a Web browser session (a.k.a. an HTTP Archive or <strong>HAR</strong> file). These are sensitive files because they can include the customer&#8217;s cookies and session tokens, which intruders can then use to impersonate valid users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okta has worked with impacted customers to investigate, and has taken measures to protect our customers, including the revocation of embedded session tokens,&#8221; their notice continued. &#8220;In general, Okta recommends sanitizing all credentials and cookies/session tokens within a HAR file before sharing it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The security firm <strong>BeyondTrust</strong> is among the Okta customers who received Thursday&#8217;s alert from Okta. BeyondTrust Chief Technology Officer <strong>Marc Maiffret</strong> said that alert came more than two weeks after his company alerted Okta to a potential problem.</p>\n<p>Maiffret emphasized that BeyondTrust caught the attack earlier this month as it was happening, and that none of its own customers were affected. He said that on Oct 2., BeyondTrust&#8217;s security team detected that someone was trying to use an Okta account assigned to one of their engineers to create an all-powerful administrator account within their Okta environment.</p>\n<p>When BeyondTrust reviewed the activity of the employee account that tried to create the new administrative profile, they found that &#8212; just 30 minutes prior to the unauthorized activity &#8212; one of their support engineers shared with Okta one of these HAR files that contained a valid Okta session token, Maiffret said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our admin sent that [HAR file] over at Okta&#8217;s request, and 30 minutes after that the attacker started doing session hijacking, tried to replay the browser session and leverage the cookie in that browser recording to act on behalf of that user,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Maiffret said BeyondTrust followed up with Okta on Oct. 3 and said they were fairly confident Okta had suffered an intrusion, and that he reiterated that conclusion in a phone call with Okta on October 11 and again on Oct. 13.</p>\n<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Okta&#8217;s Deputy Chief Information Security Officer <strong>Charlotte Wylie</strong> said Okta initially believed that BeyondTrust&#8217;s alert on Oct. 2 was not a result of a breach in its systems.

Those who are fooled into clicking the update button will have a malicious file dropped on their system that tries to install an information stealing trojan.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, researchers at the Tel Aviv-based security firm <strong>Guardio</strong> said they tracked an updated version of the ClearFake scam that included an important evolution. Previously, the group had stored its malicious update files on Cloudflare, Guardio said.</p>\n<p>But when Cloudflare blocked those accounts the attackers began storing their malicious files as cryptocurrency transactions in the <strong>Binance Smart Chain</strong> (BSC), a technology designed to run decentralized apps and &#8220;smart contracts,&#8221; or coded agreements that execute actions automatically when certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p><strong>Nati Tal</strong>, head of security at <strong>Guardio Labs</strong>, the research unit at Guardio, said the malicious scripts stitched into hacked WordPress sites will create a new smart contract on the BSC Blockchain, starting with a unique, attacker-controlled blockchain address and a set of instructions that defines the contract&#8217;s functions and structure. When that contract is queried by a compromised website, it will return an obfuscated and malicious payload.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These contracts offer innovative ways to build applications and processes,&#8221; Tal <a href=\"https://labs.guard.io/etherhiding-hiding-web2-malicious-code-in-web3-smart-contracts-65ea78efad16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> along with his Guardio colleague <strong>Oleg Zaytsev</strong>. &#8220;Due to the publicly accessible and unchangeable nature of the blockchain, code can be hosted &#8216;on-chain&#8217; without the ability for a takedown.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tal said hosting malicious files on the Binance Smart Chain is ideal for attackers because retrieving the malicious contract is a cost-free operation that was originally designed for the purpose of debugging contract execution issues without any real-world impact.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So you get a free, untracked, and robust way to get your data (the malicious payload) without leaving traces,&#8221; Tal said.<span id=\"more-65327\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65371\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65371\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-65371\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fakebrowser-guardio.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"814\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-65371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Attacker-controlled BSC addresses — from funding, contract creation, and ongoing code updates. Image: Guardio</p></div>\n<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, the <strong>BNB Smart Chain</strong> (BSC) said its team is aware of the malware abusing its blockchain, and is actively addressing the issue. The company said all addresses associated with the spread of the malware have been blacklisted, and that its technicians had developed a model to detect future smart contracts that use similar methods to host malicious scripts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This model is designed to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats before they can cause harm,&#8221; BNB Smart Chain wrote. &#8220;The team is committed to ongoing monitoring of addresses that are involved in spreading malware scripts on the BSC. To enhance their efforts, the tech team is working on linking identified addresses that spread malicious scripts to centralized KYC [Know Your Customer] information, when possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guardio says the crooks behind the BSC malware scheme are using the same malicious code as the attackers that McEoin wrote about in August, and are likely the same group. But a report published today by email security firm <strong>Proofpoint</strong> says the company is currently tracking at least four distinct threat actor groups that use fake browser updates to distribute malware.</p>\n<p>Proofpoint notes that the core group behind the fake browser update scheme has been using this technique to spread malware for the past five years, primarily because the approach still works well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fake browser update lures are effective because threat actors are using an end-user&#8217;s security training against them,&#8221; Proofpoint&#8217;s <strong>Dusty Miller</strong> <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/are-you-sure-your-browser-date-current-landscape-fake-browser-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. &#8220;In security awareness training, users are told to only accept updates or click on links from known and trusted sites, or individuals, and to verify sites are legitimate. The fake browser updates abuse this training because they compromise trusted sites and use JavaScript requests to quietly make checks in the background and overwrite the existing website with a browser update lure. To an end user, it still appears to be the same website they were intending to visit and is now asking them to update their browser.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More than a decade ago, this site published <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/05/krebss-3-basic-rules-for-online-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Krebs&#8217;s Three Rules for Online Safety</a>, of which Rule #1 was, &#8220;<em>If you didn&#8217;t go looking for it, don&#8217;t install it.</em>&#8221; It&#8217;s nice to know that this technology-agnostic approach to online safety remains just as relevant today.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/the-fake-browser-update-scam-gets-a-makeover/feed/","slash:comments":"27"},{"title":"Tech CEO Sentenced to 5 Years in IP Address Scheme","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/tech-ceo-sentenced-to-5-years-in-ip-address-scheme/","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/tech-ceo-sentenced-to-5-years-in-ip-address-scheme/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"BrianKrebs"},"pubDate":"Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:23:25 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Ne'er-Do-Well News"},{"#cdata-section":"Web Fraud 2.0"},{"#cdata-section":"American Registry for Internet Numbers"},{"#cdata-section":"Amir Golestan"},{"#cdata-section":"ARIN"},{"#cdata-section":"Micfo LLC"},{"#cdata-section":"spamhaus"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=65335"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Amir Golestan, the 40-year-old CEO of the Charleston, S.C. based technology company Micfo LLC, has been sentenced to five years in prison for wire fraud.

ARIN and Micfo settled that dispute in arbitration, with Micfo returning most of the addresses that it hadn’t already sold.</p>\n<p>ARIN&#8217;s civil case caught the attention of federal prosecutors in South Carolina, who in May 2019 <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/a-tough-week-for-ip-address-scammers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filed criminal wire fraud charges against Golestan</a>, alleging he’d orchestrated a network of shell companies and fake identities to prevent ARIN from knowing the addresses were all going to the same buyer.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors showed that each of those shell companies involved the production of notarized affidavits in the names of people who didn’t exist. As a result, the government was able to charge Golestan with 20 counts of wire fraud — one for each payment made by the phony companies that bought the IP addresses from ARIN.</p>\n<p>Golestan initially sought to fight those charges. But on just the second day of his trial in November 2021, Golestan changed his mind and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/tech-ceo-pleads-to-wire-fraud-in-ip-address-scheme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pleaded guilty to 20 counts of wire fraud</a> in connection with the phantom companies he used to secure the IP addresses. Prosecutors estimated those addresses were valued at between $10 million and $14 million.<span id=\"more-65335\"></span></p>\n<p>ARIN says the 5-year sentence handed down by the South Carolina judge &#8220;sends an important message of deterrence to other parties contemplating fraudulent schemes to obtain or transfer Internet resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those who seek to defraud ARIN (or other Regional Internet Registries) are subject to costly and serious civil litigation, criminal charges, and, ultimately, a lengthy term of incarceration,&#8221; reads <a href=\"https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/10/16/micfo-golestan-sentencing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a statement</a> from ARIN on Golestan&#8217;s sentencing.</p>\n<p>By 2013, a number of Micfo’s customers had landed on the radar of <a href=\"https://www.spamhaus.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spamhaus</a>, a group that many network operators rely upon to stem the tide of junk email. Shortly after Spamhaus started blocking Micfo’s IP address ranges, Micfo shifted gears and began reselling IP addresses mainly to companies marketing “virtual private networking” or VPN services that help customers hide their real IP addresses online.</p>\n<p>Golestan did not respond to a request for comment. But in a 2020 interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Golestan claimed that Micfo was at one point responsible for brokering roughly 40 percent of the IP addresses used by the world’s largest VPN providers. Throughout that conversation, Golestan maintained his innocence, even as he explained that the creation of the phony companies was necessary to prevent entities like Spamhaus from interfering with his business going forward.</p>\n<p>There are fewer than four billion so-called “Internet Protocol version 4” or IPv4 addresses available for use, but the vast majority of them have already been allocated. The global dearth of available IP addresses has turned them into a commodity wherein each IPv4 address can fetch between $15-$25 on the open market.</p>\n<p>This has led to boom times for those engaged in the acquisition and sale of IP address blocks, but it has likewise emboldened those who specialize in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/the-great-50m-african-ip-address-heist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">absconding with</a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/feds-allege-adconion-employees-hijacked-ip-addresses-for-spamming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spamming from dormant IP address blocks</a> without permission from the rightful owners.</p>\n<p>The U.S Department of Justice says Golestan will serve 60 months in prison, followed by a 2-year term of court-ordered supervision. The Micfo CEO also was ordered to pay nearly $77,000 in restitution to ARIN for its work in assisting federal prosecutors.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/tech-ceo-sentenced-to-5-years-in-ip-address-scheme/feed/","slash:comments":"25"}]}}/*
