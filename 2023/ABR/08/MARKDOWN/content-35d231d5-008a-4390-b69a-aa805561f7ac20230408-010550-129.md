<p>The new ISO/SAE
21434 standard, as well as the new UNECE WP.29 rule, are both met by AutoSec.
In April 2020, C2A became an AUTOSAR development partner.</p>



<p><strong>Connected Car Cybersecurity</strong></p>



<p>A connected car
is one that can communicate with other systems outside of the vehicle in both
directions (LAN). This enables the car to exchange internet connection and, as
a result, data with other devices both inside and outside the vehicle.</p>



<p>Connected
vehicles, in conjunction with other upcoming vehicular technologies such as
automated driving, electric automobiles, and shared mobility, are helping to
create a new type of future mobility: autonomous, connected, electric, and
shared vehicles.</p>



<p>A vehicle can
connect to its surroundings and communicate with them in three ways:</p>



<p><strong>(V2I) Vehicle
to Infrastructure Connectivity:</strong> This technology collects
data from the vehicle and gives the driver with information on the
infrastructure. Information concerning safety, mobility, or environmental
conditions is communicated using V2I technology.</p>



<p><strong>(V2V) Vehicle
to Vehicle connectivity</strong>: This technology uses a
wireless exchange of data to relay information about the speed and location of
nearby vehicles. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion, avoid accidents, and
have a positive impact on the environment.</p>



<p><strong>(V2C) Vehicle
to Cloud Connectivity</strong>: This technology communicates
with a cloud system information about and for vehicle applications. This
enables the car to access data from other cloud-connected industries, such as
energy, transit, and smart homes, which all make use of IoT.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>While linked
cars provide consumers with numerous benefits, manufacturers and suppliers must
evaluate what connected cars represent for consumer privacy and security. As
more connected automobiles hit the road, malevolent hackers will be able to
exploit software flaws via cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and hard-line connections.</p>



<p>Hackers&#8217; ability
to get illegal remote access to the vehicle network and undermine vital safety
systems puts not just users&#8217; personal information at danger, but also their
physical safety.</p>



<p>Vehicle manufacturers
must implement a cybersecurity strategy that covers not only visible
vulnerabilities in their vehicles&#8217; software, but also hidden vulnerabilities
presented by open source [or third-party] components.</p>

<p>
















As evident,
the US is one of the major contributors to EV sales globally and is growing linearly
in the EV market since 2015. However, not all states share an equal
distribution of technology. As per the data given by National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (last updated June 2021), <strong>California has the maximum number of
EVs, contributing to 42% of the total nationwide</strong>. While Florida has the
second-highest number of EVs followed by Texas, Washington, New York City, New
Jersey, and Arizona. It was noted that California has a total of 42,550 public
and private EVSE ports and Florida has 7,393 charging ports. From the data
available, the year 2021 showed a rapid increase in the number of charging stations
which grew by 55%. Many US states have laws and incentives related to the use
of electric vehicles which makes the EV adoption rate to be completely
different across all the 50 states.



</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cheapest-EV-charging.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2928"/><figcaption><em>Figure 1: From Left to Right – Number of Level 1 Chargers, Level 2 Chargers, and DC Fast Chargers</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>It is well known that even though the
country is governed by federal law, the states are responsible for their own
governing and decisions, which also include decisions pertaining to the expansion
of the charging vehicle infrastructure. It is evident that not all the states
are well equipped with charging facilities. Some states like California and
Florida have adopted EV technology and have set net-zero emissions goals for
2025, while the other states have not expanded in the technology as the sales
for ICE vehicles have been dominant over the electric vehicles and hence taking
the slower route for the EVCS deployment.</p>



<p>With the new EV infrastructure bill passed by the American government, the US is expected to have around 15 million electric vehicles by 2030. This huge increase is fueled by the decarbonization and net-zero emissions target of the government. Several prominent companies such as Tesla, Electrify America, and ChargePoint are also aggressively making moves to expand their <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">charging infrastructure</a> across American states. These initiatives involve the deployment of more Level 2 chargers as compared to the DC fast chargers along with other charging infrastructure and software upgrades. However, merely adding a large number of Level 2 chargers instead of Level 3 DC fast chargers will not be a correct pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.</p>



<h2>Different levels of EV Charging</h2>



<p>There are three types of charging levels,
namely Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3based on the output power levels. A vast
majority of the charging stations across the country are Level 2 chargers,
accounting for 80% of total chargers. While Level 1 and Level 3 comprise 5% and
15% of the total chargers respectively. The primary reason for such a
distribution is the low power level of Level 1 chargers and high pricing of the
DC fast chargers, due to which the EV users are more deviated to using the
Level 2 chargers. </p>



<p>As per Alternative Fuels Data Center, there
are currently 43,163 Level 2 chargers and 6,286 DC fast chargers, and only 285
Level 1 chargers. Most of the EVs across the US are compatible to charge with
Level 1 and Level 2 charging equipment. To address the rapid charging needs of
the EVs for long runs most EV manufacturers now ensure to make it compatible
with the CCS connectors which allow the EV charging to be compatible with all
levels of charging. The Tesla vehicles come with a J1772 adapter, which allows
them to use non-Tesla charging equipment spread across the US. It additionally
provides an adapter for its users to connect with the CHAdeMO adapter. These
charging levels can be explained as below:</p>



<p><strong>Level 1 Chargers:</strong> This charging is typically used at homes where 120V AC outlets are
available. Since most of the EVs come with a portable Level 1 cord set,
therefore no additional equipment is required and can be installed easily. It
usually takes 8 hours of charging at 120 V to work for about 40 miles of
electric range for a mid-sized electric vehicle. These chargers have a minimum
pricing structure and usually come along with the EV.</p>



<p><strong>Level 2 Chargers:</strong> It is the most common type of charging observed in residential
buildings. It offers charging through a 240 V or 208 V AC outlet and can
operate at up to 80 amps and 19.2 kW. The level 2 chargers need a constant dedicated
40-Amp circuit to work in accordance with the National Electric Code
requirements in Article 625. However, most of the residential equipment
operates at lower power ratings, therefore many of these units operate at up to
30 Amps, delivering 7.2 kW of power while charging the vehicle overnight. These
Level 2 chargers are easy to use and can be installed at home and have a
reasonable pricing structure when compared to the DC chargers. They are also a
preferred choice for workplaces, shopping malls, public charging places, etc. </p>



<p><strong>Level 3 Chargers:</strong> DC fast chargers also called Level 3 chargers operate at high power
values such as 250 kW and above. These chargers are mostly found in the heavy
traffic corridors at installed stations. There are three types of DC fast
charging systems based on the type of charging port on the vehicle namely, SAE
Combined Charging System (CCS), CHAdeMO, and Tesla. The CCS connectors used are
unique in the application as they can be used for all three types of charging
levels, the only difference is DC fast charging connectors have two additional
bottom pins. The only setback with the DC fast chargers is the high installation
and maintenance costs, which hinders its expansion.</p>



<h2>Miles per hour of charging time</h2>



<p>The charging time for an EV can be as long
as 8 to 12 hours and as short as 15 to 30 mins only depending on the type of
charger used. A typical electric car has a 60-kWh battery that can be charged
from zero to 100% within a duration of 8 hours using the 6.6 kW charging power
or can be charged under 30 mins by using a rapid DC fast charger. These DC fast
chargers are the fastest way to add up to 60 to 200 miles of range by mere
charging the EV for 30 mins or less.</p>



<p>The Level 1 chargers are very slow, adding nearly 5 miles of range per hour as compared to the Level 2 chargers which can add up to 25 miles of range per hour, therefore the EV drivers tend more towards using the Level 2 charging. For the DC fast charging, although it can speed up the charging process and can add up several miles, not all the EVs are compatible with such high-power values and therefore the chargers are less in number, comprising only 15% of the total public charging ports across the US.</p>

<p><em>Table 1: Comparison Table of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 chargers</em></p>



<h2>Which region is the cheapest for EV charging across the
US? </h2>



<p><strong>“What will be the charging cost for the electric car?” &#8211; </strong>This is the most asked question by EV users and new adopters of the technology and can only be answered by a thorough evaluation of the geography and the policies adopted by the region. The charging cost for electric cars in America depends on various factors such as geography, connectors, power consumed, charging time, type of battery, and many other such factors. In order to understand which US region has the cheapest <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charging price</a>, it can be understood by the monthly electricity rates and the number of charging points in the vicinity. </p>



<p>Based on the number of charging ports, it
is evident that California and Florida have the maximum number of charging
ports. However, the cost of electricity varies in different states of the US.
For instance, In the residential areas of California and New York have rates as
high as 26.71 and 19.74 cents per kWh respectively, while states like Florida,
Utah, Washington Oregon, and Montana have low electricity rates (Cents per Kilowatt-hour)
like 13.50, 10.55, 10.14, 11.01, and 10.76 cents per kWh respectively as per
the EIA electric Power Monthly. These costs vary for the transportation sector
region-wise. Further, the home charging prices are usually lower than the
public charging stations as the home charging prices do not include
installation, infrastructure development, maintenance, host fees, etc. </p>



<p>Through the above analysis, it can be
evaluated that a lower electricity consumption rate of 13.50 cents per kWh and
the number of charging ports across the region at regular miles make <strong>Florida
the cheapest region for EV charging as of now for the home EV charging</strong>.
While based on the US state electricity rates for the transportation sector and
the number of charging stations, Texas’s electricity rate for the
transportation sector is 7.27 cents per kWh and 5,372 public charging ports
which is the third-largest number of charging ports available across the US.
Therefore<strong>, Texas can be considered the cheapest region for EV charging.</strong></p>

<p>Electric vehicles offer several benefits
over conventional ICE-based vehicles. EVs are cheaper in the long run, easy to
maintain, and have a lower carbon footprint. With more users realizing the
benefits of the EVs, they are looking for charging options that are convenient,
time-saving, and easy to use. It was observed that a huge EV user base
preferred the home charging points over the commercial charging stations. The
probable reasons for the mass shift could be the advantages offered by the home
charging systems. The home or the residential chargers do not essentially mean
a private home connection, it may also mean a private workplace, shopping mall,
or home offering charging service to only a certain number of users. </p>



<p>EVs are usually charged at the <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">public charging stations</a> or with the home charging points. Through the data analysis done by companies, a majority of charging was done using the home charging points during the nighttime whereas the daytime charging was split between public charging stations and private charging stations at the workplaces or malls, etc. Even though the public charging stations offer a rapid charging facility and zero installation costs to the user, it also has some potential drawbacks. The long waiting queues and the time required to charge the vehicle thereafter cause great inconvenience, thereby deviating users towards adopting home charging systems. Another prominent setback of the public charging station is the DC fast charging ports, which when used constantly degrade the car batteries at a faster rate and come with premium pricing.</p>



<p>In contrast, the home charging points may have some initial deployment costs but offers several benefits over the public charging stations in the long term. The current home chargers are usually Level 1 and Level 2 chargers which provide charging through 120 V and 240 V AC circuits respectively. The Level 3 chargers i.e., the <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">DC fast chargers</a> are compatible only with certain car models and are available at the public charging stations only. The below-listed points further enlighten the three levels of charging and their throughput.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Level I Charger:</strong> Overnight charging using a 120-volt AC outlet</li><li><strong>Level II Charger:</strong> 4-6 hours to charge with 240 volts and 40 amps continuous load</li><li><strong>Level III Charger (DC Fast Charger):</strong> Capable of providing a 100% charging in less than 30 minutes (voltage and current rating vary according to the CPOs)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Top-Benefits-of-Charging-a-car-at-Home.jpg" alt="Types of charging connectors " class="wp-image-2922"/><figcaption><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Figure</span><em> 1: Types of charging connectors</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>With these charging options, most EV users are now able to meet the driving range requirements by easily charging their vehicles overnight through the home charging points. Some of the top benefits of having a <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">home EV charging point</a></strong> can be enlisted as:</p>



<p><strong>Charge at ease: </strong>The home charging points eliminate the need to wait in a long queue to charge the vehicle at the charging stations during peak hours. The EV consumers can easily charge their vehicles at their preferred time and convenience without investing a dedicated time at the <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">charging station</a>. Also, since most countries do not have a significant number of charging stations required to address the increasing sales of EVs, installing home chargers will give users a sense of reliability with EV usage.</p>



<p><strong>Affordable</strong>:
EV chargers at home only require a dedicated power outlet near the parking
location home and no other additional installation costs are required, unless
Level 2 chargers are installed which have minimal installation costs. The household
electricity rates per kWh are low as compared to the public charging station electricity
rates, therefore the users need to pay the high charging rates set by the
third-party energy companies like BP and Shell. Such eliminated overhead
charges at the public charging stations make the home charging system more
affordable. </p>



<p>It was observed that the users who used solar
panels for electricity saved more with the home charging solutions. These home
chargers also provide real-time time data using which the EV consumers can also
claim tax benefits in some countries.</p>



<p><strong>Battery Health Optimization: </strong>Any battery degrades over a certain period of time, however even if the
public charging station offers great charging at a faster speed, it may cause
potential damage to the car battery health due to its high-power charging
ports. The home charging points on the contrary charge the vehicle with minimal
voltage levels, leading to delayed battery degradation and optimized usage</p>



<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Most EV home chargers are compatible with a wide array of electric
vehicles. Such additional benefits add in terms of future EV purchases by the
user from a different manufacturer. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Faster and Safer Charging: </strong>Using a home charging point can be faster than the public charging
station unless the user is using the fast-charging port which has very high
prices. The home charge</p>



<p>Another major benefit of using the home
charging points is safety and security. At the public stations, leaving the car
for a longer duration may expose it to several risks of theft and vandalism,
therefore using home charging points assures the users with safe charging of
the vehicle.</p>



<h2>How Americans Charge EVs &#8211; At home or at Commercial EVCS</h2>



<p>As per the Alternative Fuel Data Center of
the US Department of Energy, the present American EVCS network consists of a
total of 48,298 public charging stations out of which only 6,265 are the DC
fast chargers and the rest mostly are equipped with the Level 2 chargers. About
80% of these charging points comprise Level 2 chargers. These Level 2 chargers
charge the vehicles ~6.8 times faster than the Level 1 chargers and come with
an optimized pricing structure as compared to the DC fast chargers, therefore
are the most widely preferred chargers across America. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As electric vehicles are getting ubiquitous in the US, the need for fast and accessible charging systems has also increased. Automakers like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen through its subsidiary Electrify America are investing in expanding the <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charging stations</a></strong> across America. However, the problem of accessible charging points will persist unless the deployments of these planned charging infrastructures are completed. To address this problem the state governments and the local authorities are figuring out ways to make the <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">electric charging systems</a> available to maximum EV users. For instance, to reach the target of net-zero emission by 2028, Los Angeles has started providing a rebate to developers and managers who are offering charging stations in the parking lots for buildings with multiple families. </p>



<p>In a densely populated area like New York
City, where owning a private space for parking is a luxury, maximum residents
cannot use private home charging systems. To ease such a problem, the local
government of the city launched a curbside charging network called PlugNYC,
through a partnership with Con Edison and Canadian charging station company FLO.
The PlugNYC has an initial installation of 34 stations with 100 plugs and
additional 4 stations with 20 plugs for the city’s fleet vehicles. It further plans
to install 40,000 public Level 2 chargers and 6,000 DC fast chargers by 2030. NYC
is focused on creating one of the largest municipal electric vehicle charging
networks to support the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. </p>



<p>As for the rural American areas, the US Department of Transportation has introduced the Rural <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV Infrastructure</a> Toolkit under the ROUTES Initiative to help rural entities plan the infrastructure and fund EV chargers. While in West Virginia, State Parks has installed electric charging stations where EV drivers get the complimentary service of free EV charging, while they rent the lodge or spend money in the shop. The Colorado Energy Office and Regional Air Quality Council have supported the installation of the first Level 2 charging station in the parking spaces. The Carbondale has expanded to 16 charging stations, of which 15 are free Level 2 charging stations.</p>



<p>Through such initiatives, it is evident
that the US government is working in its direction to achieve the target set by
the federal government of net-zero emissions. However, shifting the usage from
ICE-based vehicles to electric or hybrid electric vehicles will be a critical
factor in deciding the EV charging infrastructure of the US in near future. </p>



<h2>Growth Strategy Ahead &#8211; American Commercial EVCS Network</h2>



<p>During the period 2011 to 2013, the US
Department of Energy along with ChargePoint installed 17,000 AC Level 2
charging and over 100 fast charging ports in 22 regions of the country for
residential and commercial usage. Through this project, it was noticed that
despite the installation of several public charging stations, the major
population of EV consumers utilized the home or work charging stations.
However, now with the higher installations of public and home charging stations,
a survey conducted on the consumer behavior, reflected that around 57% of the
EV user population is willing to invest in the home charging Level 2 chargers,
while the rest of the EV drivers are tending towards paying a premium for DC
fast charging points.</p>



<p>In December 2021, the US government
announced the Electric Vehicle Charging Action Plan which is aimed at building
a national network of 500,000 EV charging stations. The plan includes a total
investment of USD 7.5 billion, where USD 2.5 billion will be utilized in rural
charging, improving local air quality, and increasing EV charging access in
disadvantaged communities and corridors. The government has also planned on
increasing the domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components. Such
initiatives by the US government in the EV charging systems are transformative
with an aim to touch down the net-zero emissions by the year 2050. Additionally,
companies like Electrify America are also extending their support in achieving
the net-zero emission target. The company is planning to invest USD 2 billion
in Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) infrastructure across the US, thereby supporting
increased adoption of ZEV technology.</p>



<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>



<p>The home charging points tend to offer
numerous benefits over the public charging stations. By charging the vehicles
overnight at home, the EV drivers can save their time and are able to drive conveniently.
It is not far that the advancements in the home charging solutions will reduce
this charging time and further accelerate EV adoption. However, it is to take
note that the users will still need to top up the charging while on the long-run
routes. A co-existing public and private charging infrastructure will foster
the growth of EV charging networks.</p>



<p>Even though the US has been an early adopter of electric vehicle charging technology, nearly half of the users still step back from buying an EV due to the limited network of <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">Level 2 charging stations</a></strong> and the premium price of the fast-charging systems. To increase the adoption rate of EV technology, more installation of home chargers will be critical as the EV drivers tend to charge their vehicles with convenience in line with the optimized pricing. </p>

<p><strong>Automotive Cyber security &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>Hackers can target up to fifty different automotive IoT devices (computers) in modern vehicles. As a result, vehicle cybersecurity is crucial for vehicle safety. There are dozens of computers in modern cars, and they are not simply for navigation or music. Nearly every system in a vehicle, including steering, brakes, and the engine itself, is monitored and controlled by computers. As a result, cyber security for automobiles is essential.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Vehicle-cybersecurity.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2912"/></figure></div>



<p>Hackers can steal data or even
take control of a car if the computer systems are not properly protected. As you
might expect, this makes vehicle cyber security a top priority for customers,
automakers, and OEMs.</p>



<p>Vehicle cybersecurity entails
putting in place proven defences to: </p>



<p>• prevent data theft (such as GPS
location information or data from your smartphone connected to the Bluetooth
speaker), </p>



<p>• prevent hackers from
controlling or manipulating your vehicle (for example, by disabling the burglar
alarm or fooling the collision avoidance system), and </p>



<p>• ensure that no one can damage
your vehicle (for example, by resetting your oil change counter so you do not
get your oil changed).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software"><strong>Automotive cybersecurity</strong></a> is a relatively new sector that is rapidly evolving to keep up with the industry&#8217;s fast-paced technological improvements and the growing number of cyber events. Traditional car safety laws and security standards, unfortunately, do not adequately encompass the cyber dangers posed by today&#8217;s connected vehicles.</p>



<p><strong>Automotive Cyber security
market&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>As connectivity advancements
alter the automobile industry, the global market for connected cars is expected
to rise dramatically over the next several years. Consumers benefit from a
variety of features, including high-definition streaming video, Wi-Fi access,
better entertainment systems, and the ability to manage components of the
vehicle remotely using mobile phone applications, such as the locking/unlocking
and ignition mechanisms.</p>



<p>However, much like any other gadget that connects to the internet, cyber thieves can pose a threat to car security. Leaked personal data, risks to a vehicle&#8217;s vital security and safety procedures, and, in extreme situations, full remote control of the vehicle can all come from security breaches. Because of the increased reliance on applications, connectivity, and more complex and integrated electronic components as the industry goes toward more autonomous vehicles, these dangers are only going to get worse. Consumer confidence, privacy, and brand reputation might all suffer if these issues are not addressed. Worse, client safety is jeopardised.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/automotive-cyber-security.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2913"/></figure>



<p>The market for automotive cyber security is presently valued at $1.75 billion. By 2026, the worldwide <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">automotive cybersecurity industry</a> is expected to rise from $2.0 billion to $5.3 billion. By 2028, the market for automotive cyber security is estimated to reach $7.89 billion.</p>



<p>With the daily increase in the number of vehicles on the road and the rapid advancement of the technology involved, it is critical to establish a strong <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software"><strong>cybersecurity system</strong></a>. If this is not paid attention to, one can hack into the system and start a slew of fraudulent operations. By recognising the risk, correcting it, and protecting the computer&#8217;s security system from future threats, an automotive cybersecurity system is an efficient and effective approach for dealing with cyber threats.</p>



<p>The increased demand for an
effective and efficient security system is due to the growing acceptance of
innovative technologies in the automotive industry. Rising cyber dangers in the
transportation and automobile industries will boost demand even more. The
vehicle cyber security market will continue to grow and expand as intercity
transportation and logistics services improve. In addition, rising demand for
commercial and passenger automobiles equipped with innovative technologies, as
well as rising personal income, will expand market potential.</p>



<p>Vehicle connectivity is rapidly
expanding, resulting in a plethora of new capabilities and appealing business
models. Simultaneously, the threat of cyber-attacks on vehicle networks is
increasing. Such attacks endanger the vehicle&#8217;s functioning safety and may
result in monetary loss.</p>



<p>In addition to long-established
technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and big data and analytics,
newer technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and blockchain have
several uses in the automotive industry.</p>



<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Cyber
security</strong></p>



<p>Because technology is rapidly
advancing, there is an increasing need to concentrate on the cyber security of
electric vehicles. Owners and the EV industry should boost up their efforts to
protect vehicles and charging infrastructure from cyber-attacks, given the rush
to migrate to electric cars and trucks.</p>



<p>The spread of potentially vulnerable <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station"><strong><em>EV charging stations</em></strong></a> around the world offers a significant cyber threat as electric vehicles become a larger part of the market. If cybersecurity is not prioritised, these stations might become a hacker superhighway.</p>



<p>There are a few key cybersecurity
best practises that serve as the first line of defence against hackers.</p>



<p>• It is critical to evaluate
firewall and router setups on a regular basis.</p>



<p>• Make a list of all the
components in EVCS and look for vulnerabilities on a granular level in each of
them.</p>



<p>• Public-facing web instances
pose a substantial threat to important sectors, yet security teams routinely
ignore them. As a result, the entire environment is more vulnerable to
cyberattacks. It is critical to keep track of your assets&#8217; exposure, especially
in certain industries.</p>



<p>• Have a robust password policy
in place.</p>



<p>• Limit access to assets based on
the employee&#8217;s clearance level.</p>



<p>• Employees and those working in
vital industries must receive cybersecurity awareness training.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, electric vehicle
charging infrastructure is a device (or set of devices) that waits for another
device to connect and begin communicating without the use of a third-party
firewall or other cybersecurity devices &#8211; all these technologies must be built
into the charging station itself. EV charging stations/technologies are
particularly vulnerable to attacks due to their complexity and quick
proliferation, as some security precautions may be disregarded. Hackers appear
to have a lot of access to electric vehicle charging facilities.</p>



<p>The global effort to extend the
use of electric vehicles is picking up speed, and 2021 saw a boom in EV sales.
Electric vehicle sales are at an all-time high as purchasers rush to switch
from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs due to rising fuel costs, which are
exacerbated by global geopolitical tensions. With the growing demand for electric
vehicles (EVs) around the world, malicious attackers will target the EV
industry to cause disorder among the citizens of a country and disrupt
day-to-day operations of a metropolis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charging infrastructure</a>, like any other connected device, is subject to cyber-attacks. Nonetheless, the complexity and rapid evolution of technology and connected gadgets endangers this technology. Whether on the device itself or through a third-party app, they will require the same level of monitoring and protection to ensure that they do not open doors for hackers to pass through. As the number of electric vehicles on the road increases and more EV charging stations are built around the world, it is vital that we focus on sophisticated cybersecurity measures to keep drivers safe and safeguard the critical data in our vehicles.</p>



<p>Keeping a continual eye on both
known and unknown threats is the best method for cybersecurity professionals to
protect charging stations from intrusions. Utilities, for example, rely on
IPKeys Cyber Partners&#8217; developing VSOC (Vehicle Security Operations Centre)
platform. This programme provides for cybersecurity during the post-production
phase. Protecting connected vehicles and the smart mobility ecosystem is
critical, as it allows companies to monitor their whole infrastructure and
vehicles in real time, as well as detect cyber threats using
automotive-specific analytics.</p>



<p><strong>Cybersecurity approaches and
solutions for commercial Vehicles</strong></p>



<p>For the commercial vehicle
domain, there are a range of cybersecurity techniques and solutions. Most
solutions appear to come from other disciplines, particularly the automobile
domain. However, due to the characteristics of the commercial vehicle area,
some adaptations will be required.</p>



<p><strong>Legacy Vehicles</strong></p>



<p>Improving the cybersecurity
characteristics of commercial cars that are already on the road is difficult,
if not impossible. To prevent the most likely attack scenario, either use a
fleet management solution to connect vehicles with known vulnerabilities to the
Internet and turn off all wireless interfaces or use a filter between all
external communication interfaces and the vehicle&#8217;s electronics network.</p>



<p><strong>Separation and Network
Architectures</strong></p>



<p>Modern network topologies use
gateways to divide networks and use firewalls and filters to separate network
segments. No network with external interfaces links directly to a
safety-critical network, such as the powertrain network, and all traffic is
routed through a gateway with a firewall first. There may be dedicated networks
connecting only two nodes, such as an ADAS controller and a camera.</p>



<p>The car industry is already
moving toward the next domain controller architecture, in which only a few
sophisticated domain controllers, often connected by Ethernet, connect to basic
electronics components. The domain controller design follows the same network
isolation paradigm for security reasons.</p>



<p><strong>On-Board Communication
Security</strong></p>



<p>One of the most important
security goals is to secure on-board communication. Authentication is usually
always the essential security purpose; however, encryption is also interesting
in a few circumstances. An adversary&#8217;s ability to develop further is highly
hampered by such authenticated on-board communication. For example, if an
adversary successfully compromises a telematics unit or an OBD dongle, the
attacker is only able to authenticate messages sent to components on a
pre-defined list but not to messages sent to any safety-critical component
provided the system is properly constructed.</p>



<p><strong>Platform for Secure Computing</strong></p>



<p>Vehicle electronics necessitate a
safe computer platform. Secure boot protects integrity during start up,
hypervisors or software containers with secure inter-process communication
separate software components, and a hardened kernel as well as memory
protection (e.g., address randomization) safeguard the kernel. There are also
mechanisms for monitoring the computing platform&#8217;s integrity, such as employing
a whitelist of binary files that are allowed to be executed.</p>



<p><strong>Anomaly Tracking</strong></p>



<p>Protecting a vehicle against
cyber-attacks and data extraction is a top priority. A second objective is the
capacity to monitor the vehicle&#8217;s network and computing platforms to identify
potential breaches and improve cybersecurity over time. The output of on-board
network anomaly detection systems and ECU platform integrity monitors can be
merged, used for local anomaly detection (which may result in a basic local
reaction), and then sent via telematics to a Security Operations Centre (SOC),
which then runs analytics over all data to find anomaly patterns in the big
picture. This information is then given to automobile manufacturers and
suppliers, who examine it and begin the incident response process.</p>



<p><strong>Centre for Security Operations</strong></p>



<p>The network anomaly detection
systems and ECU platform integrity monitors of vehicles send reports to the
security operations centre (SOC). The SOC then takes these reports, analyses
them, and looks for connections between the occurrences that have been
recorded. Human analysts investigate facts to determine whether filtered
occurrences are related to cybersecurity incidents, other abnormalities, or
false alarms, using automated algorithms. The fundamental system can be
rectified, and software can be updated via firmware over-the-air procedure
after a genuine cybersecurity event is proven and the mechanisms are
understood. Naturally, the more reports from various vehicles that a SOC
receives, the more successful it becomes.</p>



<p><strong>Over-the-Air Firmware Security</strong></p>



<p>FOTA (firmware over-the-air) is a
method of updating functionality and fixing faults, some of which may be
security-related. The use of FOTA has the potential to reduce recalls. However,
there are countless cases of FOTA systems being hacked in the PC network
environment. Flame malware, for example, exploited several cryptographic flaws
before hijacking the Windows update mechanism and distributing malware.</p>



<p>Software updates are usually
protected by digitally certifying the revised firmware, so that an ECU will
only update with it if the verification is successful. The OEM and/or supplier
sign the code, ideally on a secure computer that is offline and not easily
accessible. A secure communication connection between the cloud and the car,
such as the widely used transport layer security (TLS), can further improve
security. The Uptane framework for safe FOTA strengthens security and divides
duties of the relevant entities, allowing the complete system to recover even
if a single server is compromised.</p>

<h2><strong>USE Cases</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Use Case #1:</strong>
<strong>Charging at home</strong></h3>



<p>Even though the public charging stations offer the benefits of no installment cost, they come with some potential drawbacks such as long wait times, inconvenience caused to <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">locate charging stations</a> in the vicinity, and battery damage due to level 3 high charging output power.</p>



<p>Residential chargers are usually level 2 charging stations and deliver output power between 3.7 – 22kW through either phase 1 or phase 3 of the house.  The level 2 charging at home, most of the cars take overnight to charge, however, this speed of charging also depends on the phase to which the charger is connected and the conversion rate of the AC to DC power converter of the EV. These chargers are an economically viable option as they consume electricity from the residential energy power grid or through solar energy modules at home. Several <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charger manufacturers</a> have made compatible chargers such that they can easily charge other EV models and help through intelligent software and mobile applications.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Case #2:</strong>
<strong>Wireless Charging</strong></h3>



<p>Even with ongoing electric vehicle growth, there are several drawbacks to the traditional <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">wired charging stations</a>. For instance, connectors and charging cables can wear down over a period of time, reducing the charging efficiency. Next, the need for a unified charging cable has been constantly pointed out by EV users. Such features limit the overall charging capabilities.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">Wireless charging</a></strong> offers enormous benefits over traditional wired charging stations. There are different types of wireless charging technologies available which include, inductive wireless charging, resonant inductive coupling, capacitive wireless charging, microwaves, etc. By using these technologies, a <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">wireless charging system</a></strong> is installed where vehicles remain stationary such as in parking lots. In the near future, this wireless charging system can be embedded into the roads as well, such that it will become a commercially viable option and vehicles will be charged continuously without downtime.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Case #3:</strong>
<strong>Public Charging Stations</strong></h3>



<p>Electric vehicles using public charging stations only bear the usage costs and are saved from paying the huge installment costs. The public charging stations usually use the level 2 chargers such that they are compatible with all types of vehicles. Such <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">charging stations</a> are maintained by the manufacturers and are managed by management software. These systems are easy to use for the consumer with their simple plug-and-play interface. With public charging available at more locations, the USAge of electric vehicles is set to become mainstream.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Case #4: DC</strong> <strong>Fast Charging</strong></h3>



<p>The number of electric vehicles is growing
substantially. However, downtime for charging is the major pullback for the
wider adoption of the technology. Several automakers offer the swappable
battery option to consumers, but this option is not suitable for long-term
usage, and other levels 1 and level 2 charging options are time-consuming.</p>



<p>The DC fast charging technology offers higher charging rates which chargers the <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV battery</a> much faster than the conventional charging options available. These offer a much faster charging experience within a shorter time period and the output power ranges usually from 50- 350kW. The major benefit of using a DC fast charging charger is that once it charges the vehicle’s battery up to 80% it automatically slows down the charging rate, thereby reducing the overcharging of the battery and thus maintaining the life of the EV battery. There are currently rising thermal issues over DC fast charging to which several measures to handle the battery life are underway.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining huge momentum in the ongoing scenario of rising CO2 emissions and scarce fossil fuel resources. It is due to the ongoing research and development of fast charging solutions; users find electric vehicles as the most viable option. The electric vehicle (EV) charging systems are categorized as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 based on the output power delivered. Level 3 chargers are the real game-changer of electromobility. These level 3 chargers are designed to offer power ranging from 150 kW to 400 kW and more and are operated by private networks which directly connect the charging station to the electricity grid. Some of the prominent players active in the electric vehicle charging station include ABB, Electrify America, Voltempo, EVgo, ChargePoint, and others. </p>



<p>After the global pandemic, the year 2020
witnessed a major boom in the adoption of electric vehicles. Cars such as Tesla
Model 3, ID.3 Volkswagen, Kia EV6, Porsche Taycan, Hyundai Ioniq 5etc. were
seen to drive the fast-charging market. These cars are based on the concept of DC
fast charging and the batteries installed in these cars are capable of charging
from 10 percent to 80 percent in less than 30 minutes when connected to a 350-kW
charging line. </p>



<p>Currently, automakers are collaborating with other giant groups in order to expand ultra-rapid <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">charging infrastructure</a> across geographies. Hyundai for instance has collaborated with huge South Korean giant Lotte Group and KB Asset Management. Together the companies have targeted to add 5,000 ultra-fast chargers (UFC) by the year 2025. This involves leasing high-power charging stations to private operators. Another company Porsche has deployed 35 ultra-fast charging stations in partnership with Iberdrola in Southern Europe. The charging station has a capacity of up to 400 kW, capable of recharging car batteries in less than five minutes. Such initiatives by automakers will boost the electric vehicle mobility market.</p>



<h2>Types of EV charging at stations in North America </h2>



<p>The North American market is witnessing an
overwhelming surge in electric mobility due to Level 2 and fast charging
solutions, which allow EV users to charge vehicles with ease in their homes.
While the Level 1 chargers constitute about 2% of the total EV charger across
the US, Level 2 chargers comprise a majority of 80% of charging systems, mainly
due to the higher power rating as compared to the Level 1. It was observed that
by 2021, 15% of the public EVSE port in the US were DC fast chargers. </p>



<p>The Canadian market specifically is also pursuing the EVCS market potentially well. It has a huge deployment of the Level 2, and an increasing growth was observed in the adoption of DC fast chargers. Tesla is one of the most prominent EVCS vendors in Canada. Other prominent companies include ChargePoint, FLO, EcoCharge, Electrify Canada, Petro-Canada, Greenlots, and SWTCH Energy among others. These companies are expanding their infrastructure and have made several advancements in the roaming network agreements and application interfacing, therefore attracting a huge customer base.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/North-America-EV-Charging-Station.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2907"/><figcaption> <em>Figure1: Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (Level 2 and DC Fast Charging) Across North America</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Source: Alternative Fuels Data Center (<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC">https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC</a>
)</p>



<p>With more and more DC fast charging
solutions are being deployed across North America, the major contributor being
the US. It is anticipated that DC fast chargers will further accelerate EV
adoption across the US and Canada. Companies like Electrify America,
ChargePoint, Blink, Tesla, Volta, and EVgo are some of the prominent vendors of
ultra-fast charging systems in the North American market. These companies have
deployed numerous fast-charging stations across America thereby easing
interstate transportation through highways. Automakers like General Motors and
Porsche are partnering with several vendors to expand the production of their
latest EV models which are compatible and give high performance to the user
when the electric vehicle is charged using fast charging systems. </p>



<p>ABB another prominent <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">electric vehicle charging station</a></strong> manufacturer is seen to be expanding its footprint in the North American market by deploying ABB’s Terra 53 DC charging stations. </p>



<h2>EV Charging Station Business Opportunities</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">electric vehicle charging business</a> heavily relies on uniformity across the EV charging station standards and equipment. EVCS ecosystem consists of participants such as Charge Point Operators, Energy companies, and Automotive OEMs. In order to increase the adoption of EV technology, CPOs are focusing on offering DC fast charging systems that could rapidly charge the EV batteries within minutes. The Energy companies on the other hand are offering EV fast charging at their existing gas stations by adding the appropriate infrastructure. Further, the Automakers are also considering the EVCS business as a standalone opportunity to expand their business by both entering the new market and expanding their existing EV sales. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charging stations</a> come with an end-to-end customized solution offering. The additional support of backend power infrastructure, compatibility for different EV charging standards, and various software are now easing the usage of electric charging systems. Several places such as public malls, restaurants, workplaces, and housing societies are now having charging stations thereby providing more convenient options to charge their vehicle on the go. China, the US, and Germany are investing heavily in the research and development of the <strong><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station">EV charging infrastructure</a></strong>. </p>



<p>It is expected that the electric vehicle
will constitute about 30% of the total vehicles by 2025, and this trend will
keep on increasing majorly because of the efforts taken by both automakers and
users to reduce the CO2 emissions. This ultimately creates the need for
high-power and reliable charging stations for a mass number of users. EV users
are now leveraging the intelligent options used by the CPOs. These intelligent
features include dynamic power allocation, highway transit charging, locating
the charging stations, battery conditions, etc., further accelerating the EVCS
market.</p>



<p>It can be expected that with several options of AC and DC chargers for home and public charging stations and a wide geographic footprint, companies such as ABB, Tesla, <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station/chargepoint-inc">ChargePoint</a> will dominate the electric vehicle charging station market. Even though the ultra-fast charging system looks attractive for the electric vehicle market, it might not find major user adoption due to its high premium prices, thereby limiting the wider adoption of the technology. With more moderately priced charging systems, the CPOs can expect a major turn-on in the establishment of the fast-charging technology.</p>



<h2>The ultra-fast charging scenario</h2>



<p>ABB has been dominating the electric
vehicle charging station market with its Terra HP Generation III. Other
comparable systems such as Siemens’ SICHARGE D and Pantograph (for buses and
trucks), EV Box’s Utraoniq, Hypernova from WallBox, Electrify America’s DC Fast
Chargers and others have proven to be equally good when it comes to offering a
fast-charging system ranging from 300 kW to 350 kW in 15 minutes. However, what
sets apart the ABB is the wide range of charging and electrification solutions
for electric cars, hybrid buses, trucks, vans, ships, and railways and the
output power of 360 kW. ABB’s 3rd generation charger has a wide range of output
voltage ranging from 150 to 920 VDC and charges one EV at 350 kW or two
electric vehicles simultaneously at 175 kW. However, the only setback is the 350
kW or 175 kW (for two EVs) charging line is applicable only to the version with
two CCS connections.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In 2022, <strong>Voltempo</strong> a leading technology developer of electric automakers launched its <strong>HyperCharging</strong>. As per the company, the HyperCharging system can deliver 1,000kW of power which is around 2.8 times more than the power delivered by the other comparable charging stations. This solution is able to charge the compatible electric vehicle within 6 minutes and has a unique capability of charging 24 vehicles simultaneously. Through its demonstration, the charging system looks promising for now and Voltempo has further stated that it will be able to build a charging system with the efficiency that could match a similar time that it takes to refuel a conventional, petrol-driven vehicle. Another prominent company, <strong>Iberdrola</strong> has launched an ultra-fast charging hub for electric vehicles having a capacity of up to 400 kW and is capable of recharging car batteries in less than five minutes and can charge up to 16 vehicles simultaneously.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Analysis-of-the-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-System.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2908"/><figcaption><em>Figure 2: Analysis of the Electric Vehicle Charging System based on power and charging time taken</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though, with such high-power charging
technologies in place, how much the EV users will be able to leverage the
fast-charging technology will entirely depend on the vehicle since not all
types of EV batteries are designed to handle such high-power ratings. However,
it can be predicted that once the automakers develop the compatible EV
batteries and Voltempo expands its geographic presence with the 1000 kW power
technology, a major transformation across the electric mobility market is bound
to take place.</p>

<p><strong>USE Cases</strong></p>



<p><strong>Use Case #1: Network Security</strong></p>



<p>The underlying network architecture of an organization
consists of hardware and software systems that are highly susceptible to data
breaches, intrusions, and other cyber-attacks. Further, the advent of the 4G,
5G, and a more cloud-centric working structure have made organizations more
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, features like network security become
an essential aspect to protect the electronic network infrastructure of an
organization from unauthorized access, misuse, or malfunctioning of the entire system.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">Network
security</a> helps in identifying such malicious activities by deploying the
proper security architecture. This security architecture provides visibility
across the network and takes measures to prevent potential threats. <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">Network
security tools</a> such as firewalls, remote access VPN, zero-trust network
access, email security, etc. secure the networks, clouds, and other
infrastructure against the evolving vulnerabilities in the network.</p>



<p><strong>Use Case #2: Identity Access and Management</strong></p>



<p>Identity Access and Management are an important part of any enterprise.
As businesses are shifting toward a remote working model, data security becomes
critical. Such rapid transformation across organizations have pushed the
companies to incorporate proper identity and access management frameworks.</p>



<p>The identity access and management are automated frameworks that
manage the digital identities and users’ access to company resources both on
the premises and remotely. It also includes the management of technologies,
networks, and systems used for data processing. Now instead of conventional
password login systems, robust authentication techniques like multifactor
authentication, risk-based authentication, and zero-trust are in place to
combat the growing cyber-attacks. </p>



<p><strong>Use Case #3: Threat Intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>In the world of <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">cybersecurity software</a>, organizations are continuously under the threat of cyber-attacks. Cyber attackers gain access to the data through social engineering techniques or phishing emails, causing heavy security vulnerabilities. Such evolving cyber threat landscape puts immense pressure on the organizations to inculcate practices to detect and monitor the malicious activities in advance.</p>



<p>Threat intelligence constantly gathers information on
emerging and existing cyber threats from various sources. It efficiently
analyzes the data and provides insightful feeds to outmaneuver the threat
actors or agents. By using proactive monitoring techniques such as threat
intelligence organizations can ensure real-time security and be well informed
about the potential advanced persistent threats, thereby preventing any data
compromise.</p>

<p>When it comes to
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword, with defenders using
it to respond to and predict threats and attackers using it to execute even
more refined attacks. For example, AI systems can send &#8216;spear phishing&#8217; tweets
(tailored tweets sent to selected individuals to fool them into disclosing
critical information) six times faster and twice as effectively as a human.</p>



<p>AI has become a
major tool in stopping cyberattacks as the attack surface has become larger and
attacks have become more sophisticated. Organizations are turning to artificial
intelligence because cyber analysts are finding it increasingly difficult to
adequately monitor current levels of data volume, velocity, and variety across
firewalls.</p>



<p>Here is a look
at what 12 hot AI security companies is up to, from finding qualities that
several threats share to taking on well-camouflaged malware to advising
corporations on how to deploy security resources.</p>



<p><strong>1. Awake

<p>Artificial
intelligence detects and blocks attacks before they can take place, preventing
BlackBerry consumers from visiting spoofing pages that seem like real websites.
BlackBerry&#8217;s resilient AI model stops zero-day payloads from running, and the
company&#8217;s field-proven AI inspects any programme attempting to run on an
endpoint before it runs.</p>



<p>BlackBerry
Protect also uses artificial intelligence to recognise and block dangerous
URLs, including those that contain phishing components. According to
BlackBerry, the company&#8217;s AI-driven security endpoint offering provides
proactive protection, detection, and response, as well as integrated mobile
threat defence, continuous authentication, and adaptive risk scoring.</p>



<p><strong>3. Balbix</strong></p>



<p>Balbix&#8217;s
BreachControl technology employs artificial intelligence to provide continuous
risk projections, risk-based vulnerability management, and proactive breach
control. The platform assists <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">cybersecurity

organization&#8217;s extended enterprise inventory, as well as the business
criticality of each asset and user. Balbix is quite familiar with the numerous
security solutions and methods that <a href="https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software">top cybersecurity
companies</a> use as part of their overall breach risk reduction strategy.</p>



<p>Balbix also
provides prescriptive advice on how businesses can effectively setup and
upgrade their security policies and processes to maximise cyber-resilience
while minimising business disruption. Users, security operations, CISO,
auditors, CIO, CEO, and board members will benefit from the company&#8217;s
visualisations and reports, which explain calculations and provide
recommendations.</p>



<p><strong>4. Blue
Hexagon</strong></p>



<p>Blue Hexagon&#8217;s
deep learning models examine millions of attributes in payloads, protocols, and
headers in less than a second to identify threats. The business claims that
their cloud security and network detection and response (NDR) solution use deep
learning-based artificial intelligence to detect a wide range of known and
undiscovered file-based and protocol-based threats.</p>



<p>Blue Hexagon
claims that by using deep learning to scan all headers and payloads in real
time, it can detect cloud misconfigurations and defend cloud assets without the
need to deploy and manage agents. When applied to network traffic, Blue Hexagon
can make intelligent choices about whether the traffic is malicious, allowing
for near-real-time response.</p>



<p>Cloud
configurations, network traffic, cloud storage activity, and the complete
threat kill chain can all be analysed in real time using the company&#8217;s technologies.
Its agentless artificial intelligence is ready to use right now, requiring no
re-architecting, baselining, signatures, or sandboxing. Blue Hexagon claims
that its system can protect against zero-day exploits, ransomware, lateral
movement, C2, and exfiltration.</p>



<p><strong>5. Callsign</strong></p>



<p>Callsign uses
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to authenticate a person&#8217;s
identity based on swipes on a touchscreen, keystrokes on a keyboard, locations
visited, and other behaviours. The company&#8217;s hallmark platform, intelligence-driven
authentication, combines multi-factor authentication with fraud analytics
powered by deep learning technology to tackle everything from identity fraud to
SMS phishing.</p>



<p>The Intelligence
Engine from Callsign is a secure and compliant solution for any situation. It
analyses hundreds of data points in real time from devices, locations,
behaviours, and third-party systems. It warmly welcomes legitimate users while
leaving bad actors out in the cold, protecting you from malware, bots, sophisticated
scams, and telecom fraud.</p>



<p><strong>6. Darktrace</strong></p>



<p>Across email and
cloud services, industrial equipment, and the corporate network, the Darktrace
Immune System can detect what is harmful or malicious in real time. It enables
security teams to move away from a plethora of segregated point solutions with
limited visibility in favour of a single AI &#8220;brain&#8221; that benefits
from enterprise-wide context and leaves attackers with nowhere to hide.</p>



<p>Darktrace&#8217;s
Enterprise Immune System learns normal &#8216;patterns of life&#8217; to identify
unforeseen cyber-threats while providing total visibility across the
enterprise, from cloud and collaboration tools to endpoints and the corporate
network. And Cyber AI Analyst combines various security occurrences into a
single security incident and presents its results in a clear,
easy-to-understand narrative.</p>



<p>Meanwhile,
Antigena Network protects key data and operations autonomously around the
clock, surgically interrupting threats across cloud services, IoT, and the
corporate network. Antigena Email, on the other hand, leverages Darktrace&#8217;s
core artificial intelligence to stop the most complex email threats, and it
works for everyone from small charity to large enterprises.</p>



<p><strong>7. Fortinet</strong></p>



<p>Fortinet&#8217;s

abnormal in the local network, and link disparate occurrences to show the
bigger assault story. Vectra begins by identifying and analysing as many
threats as possible to determine what they have in common, which necessitates a
large-scale examination of malicious traffic as well as the skill to determine
what is genuinely important.</p>
