<p>The US government, worried about the continuing growth of cybercrime, ransomware, and countries including Russia, Iran, and North Korea hacking into government and private networks, is in the middle of drastically changing its cybersecurity strategy. No longer will it rely largely on prodding businesses and tech companies to voluntarily take basic security measures such as patching vulnerable systems to keep them updated.</p><p>Instead, it now wants to establish baseline security requirements for businesses and tech companies and to fine those that don’t comply.</p><p>It’s not just companies that use the systems who might eventually need to abide by the regulations. Companies that make and sell them, such as Microsoft, Apple, and others could be held accountable as well. Early indications are that the feds already have Microsoft in their crosshairs — they’ve warned the company that, at the moment, it doesn’t appear to be up to the task.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3690592/feds-to-microsoft-clean-up-your-security-act-or-else.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Mac, iPad, and iPhone users can choose to automatically install system security patches as they are released with a new Apple feature called Rapid Security Response.</p><p>Rapid Security Response aims to secure Apple’s platforms with automated security updates. The idea is that if every user automatically installs such patches, the entire ecosystem becomes inherently more secure.</p><p>Announced last year at WWDC 2022, Apple began testing the feature in October. During beta testing, it shared four content-free downloads to test its distribution system, including one <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/03/06/apple-releases-second-rapid-security-response-in-ios-164-beta" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent test in March</a>.

The proposal suggests that privacy protection will no longer be something big tech can argue against – companies will be required to prioritize privacy.
