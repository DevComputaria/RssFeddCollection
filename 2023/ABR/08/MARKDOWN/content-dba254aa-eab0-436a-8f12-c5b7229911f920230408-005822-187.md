US eyes aid to stop violence spilling into coastal West Africa

<p>Speaking to AFP, the officials said Western support was also critical to halting Russia's Wagner mercenary group which has made major inroads in violence-torn Sahel countries, including by allying with Mali's military junta.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, visiting Ghana last month as part of a growing US push in Africa, promised $100 million over 10 years to reinforce resilience in coastal West Africa. State Department officials are also looking at additional funding including from the counter-terrorism budget.</p>
<p>In a new global strategy to prevent conflict and promote stability, President Joe Biden's administration identified coastal West Africa as a priority for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The report, released in March, said that the Sahel to the immediate north had experienced more terrorist attacks than any other region and that it was critical to "prevent violent conflicts from emerging or further spreading across the region."</p>
<p>While coastal cities connected to the world through seaports have been unscathed, violence has been rising in areas bordering Mali and Burkina Faso.</p>
<p>"It's a significant and burgeoning threat," said Michael Heath, the deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of West Africa.</p>
<p>"It's something of concern to us because the capabilities of the governments in place -- they've never faced a threat like this before," he told AFP.</p>
<p>"They're trying to cope with this, and we're trying to see what kind of tools they need," said Heath, who recently returned from a trip to the region with other State Department officials to assess needs.</p>
<p>Heath said he has not yet seen a presence in the three countries of the Wagner Group, which has been accused of human rights abuses in several countries including Ukraine, where the unit has played a key role in the invasion.</p>
<p>"They're not yet in the coastal West African states, but we know they're looking for opportunities to take advantage of instability wherever they see it," he said.</p>
<p>US officials accuse Russia of stepping up disinformation in French-speaking Africa, seeing a ripe audience due to post-colonial resentments.</p>
<h1>'Holistic' approach</h1>
<p>Concerns in the Sahel about violence as well as Russia have grown in the months since France ended an eight-year campaign against jihadists, which some critics faulted as overly focused on military solutions.</p>
<p>US officials said that coastal West Africa would not be seeing violence without spillover from the north, but that instability can also be attributed to local factors and competition for resources as climate change aggravates scarcities.</p>
<p>US officials said assistance would focus in part on addressing economic gaps that would help extremists recruit.</p>
<p>"We want to obviously help these governments who are more interested in a holistic approach and good governance address the problems of the north, where the resources are sparser," said Gregory LoGerfo, a senior State Department counterterrorism official who was on the trip.</p>
<p>One key area, US officials said, will be helping West African governments build their legal systems so they can distinguish between legitimate refugees fleeing the Sahel and security threats.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of people with family ties across borders in Burkina Faso and back and so forth," LoGerfo said.</p>
<p>"You want a management system where you're not shutting off families or economies, but you also have to address the security problem," he said.</p>

<img src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33435550&width=980"/><br/><br/><p>The Russian arrest of American journalist Evan Gershkovich drew a rare joint statement from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who demanded the reporter’s immediate release on Friday. The Senate’s Democratic and Republican leaders said the March 29 jailing of Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was “wrongful” and marked the latest transgression in Russia’s “long and disturbing history of unjustly detaining U.S. citizens.” “Let there be no mistake: journalism is not a crime,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, and McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said...</p>

"Putin waited for applause as he finished talking but none came."</p><p>"This is a delicious moment. Putin clearly expected a polite applause, but he received none. The ambassadors—some having been scolded—expected at least a hand shake, and they got none," Swedish economist Anders Åslund wrote on <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

Monza is with you."</p><p>The declining health of the three-time prime minister has caused Berlusconi to be in and out of the hospital in recent years. His latest admission to San Raffaele Hospital came just a week after being discharged after a four-day stay.<br/></p><p>But on Friday, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, the No. 2 in Berlusconi's right-wing party Forza Italia, told Rai 3 television that the patient "had rested well and reacted well to his treatment".</p><p>As family members and close friends paid visits to the hospital, doctors on Thursday revealed that Berlusconi was being treated for a lung infection and was suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a rare type of blood cancer affecting mainly older adults.</p><p>The cancer was in a "persistent chronic phase" but not "acute", they said. Acute leukemia is more severe and can worsen more quickly.</p><p>Called "the immortal" for his longevity in politics, the self-made billionaire elicits either fervid admiration or disdain from Italians, with his many successes going hand-in-hand with decades-long legal battles.</p><p>In September, he was reelected to the Senate, nine years after being expelled following his conviction for tax fraud.</p><p>And last month, Berlusconi won a victory in one of the many trials linked to his notorious "bunga bunga" parties, with a court acquitting him of charges that he bribed witnesses to lie about the sex parties.</p><p>But the octagenarian is only seen in public on rare occasions, and appears physically diminished.</p><p>In September 2020, Berlusconi was in hospital for 11 days for Covid-related pneumonia, complications from which caused a series of hospital stays during 2021.</p><p>Forza Italia is a junior member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition government.</p><p>© 2023 AFP</p>

Today, people can order online on the 'dark web' in a few clicks and can decide what they want and have it delivered to their homes."</p><p>The false chocolate bunnies had been parceled up and posted in Belgium, addressed to a buyer in Hong Kong, only to be intercepted at the Brussels airport freight terminal.</p><p>Meuleneire pressed his handheld scanner -- which uses Raman spectroscopy to identify substances by their chemical fingerprint -- against one supposed chocolate rabbit and took a reading.</p><p>The screen flashed green and the analysis was clear: "Caution: MDMA (ecstasy)".</p><p>"So you see? It's pure MDMA," the 61-year-old said. "So here we have, bumpety-bump, one or two kilograms of this.

Mount Everest supply transports delayed amid high numbers of tourists

Sina Schuldt/dpa</figcaption></figure></div><p>Mount Everest's main expedition season is about to begin, and yet planned climbs are being undermined by delays in the transport of supplies for mountaineers.</p>
<p>Helicopters are currently only flying large items of equipment - such as large tents and tables - to the base camp of the world's highest mountain on the instructions of the local government.</p>
<p>Food, ropes, gas for cooking and medical equipment, for example, will be carried up by local porters or on animals, Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, the deputy mayor of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Municipality, told dpa ahead of the start of climbing season in April.</p>
<p>Traditionally, yaks and jopkyos (a cross between yaks and cows from the Himalayas) trained to carry loads are used for this purpose.</p>
<p>However, according to the general secretary of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, Mohan Lamsal, there are not enough people and animals who can carry small objects up quickly - also because many of them are currently being used for trekkers from abroad.</p>
<p>About 30 tonnes of material from various expedition companies are now stored in the small town of Syangboche, where the airport closest to Mount Everest is also located, he said.</p>
<p>In recent years, he said, expedition organisers have increasingly relied on helicopter transport because it is faster but similarly expensive.</p>
<p>Expedition companies are hoping for a solution soon. The season on Mount Everest lasts from about the end of April to the beginning of June.</p>
<p>The Expedition Operator's Association Nepal expects about 500 climbers from abroad to camp at Everest base camp for several weeks with approximately 1,500 to 2,000 local helpers, who cook for them, carry their luggage and guide them up the mountain.</p>
<p>After acclimatising to the altitude, the climbers try their hand at Everest and Lhotse, both more than 8,000 metres in height, and the 7,000-metre Nuptse.</p>
<p>Foreign Everest climbers pay around $40,000 each for an expedition, according to US mountaineer and blogger Alan Arnette. Around $10,000 of this is for a climbing permit from the Tourism Ministry.</p>

Daft Punk member who performed as robot says AI has him 'terrified'

David Ebener/dpa</figcaption></figure></div><p>Thomas Bangalter, formerly one-half of electronic music duo Daft Punk, said this week that his fear of artificial intelligence was a factor in why the group split in 2021.</p>
<p>Bangalter reflected on the duo's fictional persona in a recent interview with BBC News, saying that he always felt the group's thesis was about making sure there is an absolute line "between humanity and technology."</p>
<p>"It was an exploration, I would say, starting with the machines and going away from them," <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65140938" target="_blank">he said</a>. "I love technology as a tool [but] I'm somehow terrified of the nature of the relationship between the machines and ourselves."</p>
<p>Throughout their nearly 30-year career, Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo hid their faces under gold and silver robot masks, while on their way to nabbing Grammy Awards and putting out chart-topping hits and club anthems. Albums by the duo, who hardly ever broke character, created a universe for their fictional personas to live in.</p>
<p>Even so, Bangalter shared that many fans misinterpreted their act as an uncritical embrace of tech and digital culture.</p>
<p>"We tried to use these machines to express something extremely moving that a machine cannot feel, but a human can," Bangalter said in the BBC interview. "We were always on the side of humanity and not on the side of technology."</p>
<p>To express his concerns about "the rise of artificial intelligence," Bangalter referenced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film "2001: A Space Odyssey." He credited the filmmaker for asking "the question that we have to ask ourselves about technology and the obsolescence of man."</p>
<p>In recent post-Daft Punk work, Bangalter set electronic music production aside to collaborate with French contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, composing an orchestral score for a ballet that premiered in July. The score will be <a href="https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/mythologies" target="_blank">released as an album Friday</a>.</p>
<p>"As much as I love this character," Bangalter said of his helmeted Daft Punk persona, "the last thing I would want to be, in the world we live in, in 2023, is a robot."</p>
<p>Bangalter's wariness of AI aside, a 10th-anniversary reissue of the duo's final album, "Random Access Memories," is on the way. The album — which won four Grammys in 2014, including for album of the year — is due out <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/daft-punk-announce-new-random-access-memories-reissue-with-unreleased-music/" target="_blank">May 12</a> and will feature previously unreleased music.</p>
<p>But fittingly, given Bangalter's AI apprehension, the duo decided for the 2013 album to largely abandon the synths and drum machines that colored their previous work. Critics heralded their decision to rely on live musicians — real-life humans who plucked bass lines and banged out acoustic drum riffs.</p>

<img src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33429321&width=2000&height=1500&coordinates=114%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><div class="nordot-body"><br/><p>SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - U.S. agents arrested a retired Salvadoran military officer this week on charges of participating in a brutal massacre of civilians during El Salvador's grinding civil war in the 1980s, according to a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Roberto Garay on Tuesday in the state of New Jersey, the agency said.</p>
<p>Garay served as section commander of a special military unit known as the Atlacatl Battalion from 1981 to 1985.</p>
<p>Retired Salvadoran general Juan Rafael Bustillo acknowledged in 2020 that Atlacatl was responsible for the notorious 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which more than 1,000 villagers, mostly women and children, were slaughtered.</p>
<p>The battalion carried out extrajudicial executions at El Mozote, as well as in three other massacres in which "hundreds of noncombatant civilians" were killed, ICE said.</p>
<p>Garay then "willfully" misrepresented his involvement in the massacre from an immigration application he had submitted, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Reuters was not immediately able to locate Garay's lawyer.</p>
<p>One of several bloody Central American conflicts linked to the Cold War, El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war pitted the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels against the army of the U.S.-backed right-wing government.</p>
<p>The war left some 75,000 dead and another 8,000 missing.</p>
<p>Touting the agency's investigation team that aims to hold accused war criminals accountable, ICE stressed that individuals like Garay must be investigated, prosecuted and expelled from the United States.</p>
<p>"Individuals who have committed atrocities overseas will not find safe haven in the United States," Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John K. Tien said in the statement.</p>

Israeli strikes target Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza after rocket attack

<p>JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) -Israel's military hit sites in Lebanon and Gaza early on Friday, in retaliation for rocket attacks it blamed on the Islamist group Hamas, as tensions following police raids this week on the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem threatened to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Loud blasts rocked different areas of Gaza, as Israel said its jets hit 10 targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing and development sites of Hamas, which controls the blockaded southern coastal strip.</p>
<p>At around 4.00 a.m., the military said it had also struck three Hamas infrastructure targets in southern Lebanon, where residents around the area of the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern city of Tyre reported three loud blasts.</p>
<p>"We strongly condemn the blatant Zionist aggression against Lebanon in the vicinity of Tyre at dawn today," Hamas said.</p>
<p>Two Lebanese security sources said the strike hit a small structure on farmland near the area from which the rockets had been launched earlier.</p>
<p>The strike appeared to have left a large crater in farmland in the south, according to Reuters witnesses.</p>
<p>A member of Lebanon's Civil Defense at the scene on Friday morning said there were no casualties.</p>
<p>The strikes came in response to rocket attacks from Lebanon towards northern Israeli areas, which Israeli officials blamed on Hamas. The military said 34 rockets were launched from Lebanon, of which 25 were intercepted by air defence systems. It was the biggest such attack since 2006, when Israel fought a war with the heavily armed Hezbollah movement.</p>
<p>"Israel's response, tonight and later, will exact a significant price from our enemies," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said following a security cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>As the Israeli jets struck in Gaza, salvoes of rockets were fired in response and sirens sounded in Israeli towns and cities in bordering areas. However there were no reports of serious casualties and only one rocket hit a target, damaging a house in the southern town of Sderot.</p>
<p>The crossborder strikes came amid an escalating confrontation over Israeli police raids at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which this year coincides with the Jewish Passover holiday.</p>
<p>"We hold the Zionist occupation fully responsible for the grave escalation and the flagrant aggression against the Gaza Strip and for the consequences that will bring onto the region," Hamas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Although Israel blamed Hamas for Thursday's attack, which took place as Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh was visiting Lebanon, security experts said Hezbollah, the powerful Shi'ite group which helps Israel's main enemy Iran project its power across the region, must have given its permission.</p>
<p>"It's not Hezbollah shooting, but it's hard to believe that Hezbollah didn't know about it," Tamir Hayman, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati issued a statement condemning any military operations from its territory that threatened stability but there was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Earlier on Thursday, before the rockets were fired, senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine said any infringement on Al-Aqsa "will inflame the entire region".</p>
<p>UNIFIL, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, said it had been in contact with the parties and said both sides had said they did not seek war but it said the situation risked escalation and urged all parties to halt their actions.</p>
<p>An Israeli military spokesman said the Israeli operation was over for the moment. "Nobody wants an escalation right now," he told reporters. "Quiet will be answered with quiet, at this stage I think, at least in the coming hours."</p>
<p>U.S. CONDEMNS ROCKET ATTACKS</p>
<p>Palestinian factions in Lebanon, which have a presence in the refugee camps, have fired sporadically on Israel in the past. But the border area has been largely quiet since the 2006 war with Hezbollah.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department condemned the launch of rockets from Lebanon and earlier strikes from Gaza and said Israel had the right to defend itself.</p>
<p>But it also expressed concern at the scenes in the Al-Aqsa mosque, where Israeli police were filmed beating worshippers during raids that officials said were to dislodge groups of young men who had barricaded themselves inside the mosque.</p>
<p>The Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem's Old City is Islam's third holiest site, where hundreds of thousands pray during Ramadan. Known to Jews as Temple Mount, the location of the two biblical Jewish temples, it is also Judaism's most sacred site, although non-Muslims are not allowed to pray there.</p>
<p>It has long been a flashpoint for tensions. Clashes there in 2021 helped to trigger a 10-day war between Israel and Gaza.</p>
<p>There has been widespread anger among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza over the police actions as well as condemnation from across the Arab world.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday, police said there were also disturbances in a number of Arab cities in Israel itself, including Umm el-Fahem, Sakhnin and Nazareth.</p>
<p>PLUMES OF SMOKE</p>
<p>The worsening security situation adds a further complication for Netanyahu's religious-nationalist government, which has faced mass protests over its now-suspended plans to curb the powers of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>However, opposition leader Yair Lapid said the government could count on cross-party support following the rocket attack and Netanyahu said Israelis stood behind the security forces.</p>
<p>"The internal debate in Israel will not prevent us from taking action against them wherever and whenever necessary. All of us, without exception, are united on this," Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Thursday's rocket attack, TV footage showed large plumes of smoke rising above the northern Israeli border town of Shlomi, with wrecked cars in the streets. Israel Airports Authority said it had closed the northern airports in Haifa and Rosh Pina.</p>
<p>"I'm shaking, I'm in shock," Liat Berkovitch Kravitz told Israel's Channel 12 news, speaking from a fortified room in her house in Shlomi. "I heard a boom, it was as if it exploded inside the room."</p>
<p>The Israeli military said mortar shells were also fired across the border.</p>
<p>Amid fears that the confrontation could spiral further following a year of rising Israeli-Palestinian violence, the U.N. Security Council held a closed door meeting to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>"It's going to be important for everyone to do what they can to calm tensions," U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, told reporters on his way into the meeting.</p>
<p>Thursday's attack followed a number of rocket launches towards Israel from Gaza, most of which were intercepted. Israel responded to the launches with airstrikes on sites linked to Hamas, which it holds responsible for any attacks from the blockaded coastal strip.</p>
<p>Speaking from Gaza, Mohammad Al-Braim, spokesman for the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees, praised the rocket strikes from Lebanon, which he linked to the Al-Aqsa incidents, but did not claim responsibility.</p>
<p>He said "no Arab and no Muslim would keep silent while (Al-Aqsa) is being raided in such a savage and barbaric way without the enemy paying the price for its aggression."</p>

The significant announcement is believed to be the palace’s first instance of public support for research into the royal family’s much-debated involvement in the enslavement of African people. Charles, who ascended to the throne after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September, expressed support for the research after the British newspaper The Guardi...</p>

Karakulov was a captain in the Federal Protection Service before defecting to the west.</p><p>In the new interview, Karakulov said that he worked as an engineer in a division that gave secret communications to Putin. The division was also tasked with crafting the secure communications necessary for when Putin traveled to different locations. He was never a close Putin confidant, but spent years, beginning in 2009, watching as the leader escalated his attacks on Ukraine.</p><p><strong><em>IN OTHER NEWS: <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/alvin-bragg-fires-back-after-house-gop-issues-first-subpoena-in-probe-of-trump-indictment/" target="_blank">Alvin Bragg fires back after House GOP issues first subpoena in probe of Trump indictment</a></em></strong></p><p>"Karakulov said his main reason for leaving was the the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. He said that, after the invasion, he 'simply could not be in the service of this president,'" the report said. </p><p>“The president also has a talking booth that we take on every trip abroad. This is a place from which you can conduct negotiations with guaranteed secrecy. The booth, of course, is bulky. It’s such a cube about 2.5 m high. through which you can speak without fear that the conversation can be heard or read by foreign intelligence,” said Karakulov. </p><p>His descriptions of Putin are consistent with what experts have said. Namely that Putin is extremely paranoid about COVID-19, and creates a kind of sterile circle around him at all times.</p><p>“Now he is very closed. He has protected himself from the whole world with all sorts of barriers, the same quarantine, the lack of information. His perception of reality has been distorted,” Karakulov said.</p><p>Anyone who works in the same room as Putin must have a two-week quarantine. There were questions about Putin possibly being ill, but Karakulov said that he wasn't aware of anything involving the deterioration of Putin's health.</p><p>Then there's the matter of the isolation and paranoia. He didn't clarify if the paranoia was causing the isolation, but he claimed that the Russian leader from 2009 to now is like a completely different person. </p><p>“Now he is very closed off. He has protected himself from the whole world with all sorts of barriers, the same quarantine, lack of information. His perception of reality has been distorted,” Karakulov explained. </p><p>"All the information he receives is only from people who are directly close. He lives in a kind of information vacuum," said Karakulov.</p><p>He noted that Putin doesn't use a cell phone nor does he look at the internet. <br/></p><p>The paranoia extends beyond the health aspect, however. Putin refuses to travel by plane. In the past that hasn't been an issue for the younger Putin, but now he refuses to travel in anything other than an armored train. </p><p>"Putin ordered the construction of a bunker at the Russian Embassy in Kazakhstan outfitted with a secure communications line in October," the report also stated. </p><p>Putin was once a charismatic leader, taking photos of himself shirtless riding horses and other poses. Now he doesn't watch any other television other than Russian state news, controlled by his own government.</p><p>A 2022 U.S. intelligence report after the war began detailed an atmosphere in which Putin surrounded himself with "yes men," <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/31/russia-putin-advisers-lying-about-ukraine-invasion-scared-to-tell-him-truth-white-house-intel/" target="_blank">Fortune reported at the time</a>. At first, Putin was being lied to about the poor performance in Ukraine. </p><p>"The findings, recently declassified, indicate that Putin is aware of the situation on information coming to him and there now is persistent tension between him and senior Russian military officials," the report explained.</p><p>The U.S. thinks that he's not only being lied to about the military, but  also “how the Russian economy is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-asia-global-trade-7518cee1da8c51cf07979672c5b312a3" target="_blank">being crippled by sanctions</a> because, again, his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said.</p><p><span></span>Publicly, most of Karakulov's former colleagues are supportive of Putin, but behind the scenes he hopes that they think deeper about any criminal orders they're given. </p><p>"FSO officers are constantly around the president. You can just come in and make it clear that this is a crime. And in your hands is the ability to stop this madness very quickly," Karakulov explained.</p><p>One NATO source told the AP on condition of anonymity that a defection of someone like Karakulov “has a very great level of interest. That would be seen as a very serious blow to the president himself because he is extremely keen on his security, and his security is compromised."</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/vladimir-putin-2659750090/" target="_blank">See a clip of the interview with translations below or at the link here.</a></strong></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

Macron says he is 'counting' on Xi to 'bring Russia to its senses' on Beijing visit

President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he was counting on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to "bring Russia to its senses" over its war in Ukraine.</p><p>The French president, who arrived on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, has made clear he is seeking to dissuade China from supporting Russia's invasion of its neighbor.</p><p>"I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table," the French head of state told Xi during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.</p><p>And in a joint statement following those talks, the two leaders reaffirmed their call for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow "as soon as possible".</p><p>The two sides also reaffirmed their opposition to the use of nuclear weapons during the conflict.</p><p>To coincide with their meeting, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV released a report in which Xi hailed China's "positive and steady" ties with France as the world undergoes "profound historical changes".</p><h2>'Major role'</h2><p>Macron has said during his trip that Beijing can play a "major role" in finding a path to peace in the conflict and welcomed China's "willingness to commit to a resolution".</p><p>His visit to China -- his first since 2019 -- comes as Western pressure mounts on Beijing to help push for peace in Ukraine.</p><p>Though Beijing is officially neutral, Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion.</p><p>While he recently went to Moscow to reaffirm his alliance with Vladimir Putin -- framed as an anti-Western front -- Xi has not spoken on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Macron, who is accompanied on his visit by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, said he wants to "be a voice that unites Europe" over Ukraine, and that coming to China with her serves to "underline the consistency of this approach".</p><p>In a Thursday morning meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People, Macron stressed the importance of dialogue between China and France "in these troubled times".</p><p>"The ability to share a common analysis and build a common path is essential," he said.</p><p>And in a separate meeting with Li, von der Leyen told the premier that relations between the EU and China had grown "complex in recent years".</p><p>"It is important that we discuss all aspects of this relationship together today," she said, especially in the current "volatile geopolitical environment".</p><p>Following Macron's talks with Xi, the pair will give statements to the press, followed by a meeting with von der Leyen and then a state dinner.</p><p>Macron will travel to Guangzhou in southern China to meet students on Friday, taking with him a broad delegation of top politicians, business leaders and even celebrities, including composer Jean-Michel Jarre.</p><h2>Taiwan tensions</h2><p>The visit comes in the face of mounting Chinese pressure on Taiwan, with the island's President Tsai Ing-wen meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California on Wednesday.</p><p>Tsai hailed the talks, saying they showed the self-ruled island was "not isolated" on the international stage.</p><p>Beijing baulks at any official contact between Taipei and the rest of the world, insisting there is only "one China".</p><p>Macron told journalists Wednesday he did not think his Chinese counterparts had "a desire to overreact" to the Tsai-McCarthy meeting.</p><p>China had repeatedly warned both sides that the meeting should not take place and deployed an aircraft carrier near Taiwan hours before the talks went ahead.</p><p>Three additional warships were detected in waters separating the island from China, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence said on Thursday.</p><h2>'Strongly interconnected'</h2><p>Beyond talks on Ukraine, Macron's trip has an important economic component, with the French leader keen to firm up a crucial trade partnership.</p><p>Macron is accompanied by more than 50 French business leaders on his visit, including top bosses of Airbus, EDF and Veolia.</p><p>And Airbus announced Thursday that it would open a second final assembly line in China that will double its production capacity in the country, with the framework for the deal signed by CEO Guillaume Faury in Beijing.</p><p>Asia has become a key market for both Airbus and its US rival Boeing as demand for air travel climbs with an expanding middle class.</p><p>"It makes a lot of sense for us, as the Chinese market keeps growing, to be serving local for the Chinese airlines, and probably some other customers in the region," Faury said.</p><p>Von der Leyen has also pledged to raise the EU's yawning trade deficit with China during her meetings this week.</p><p>"Our economies are strongly interconnected but the EU trade deficit is increasing due to discriminatory practices," she said in a tweet.</p><p>© 2023 AFP</p>

<p>China has not been notified by Mexico about any seizure of fentanyl from China, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing.</p>
<p>"U.S. needs to face up to its own problems and take more substantive measures to strengthen regulation within its borders and reduce demand," Mao said, referring to drug abuse as a problem "made in the U.S.".</p>
<p>Mexico's president said on Tuesday he had written to Chinese president Xi Jinping, urging him to help control shipments of fentanyl as he fended off criticism in the U.S. that Mexico is not doing enough to stop trafficking of the synthetic opioid.</p>
<p>Fentanyl, widely used in hospitals during anaesthesia and for pain relief, has become a major black market narcotic in the United States. Mexican drug cartels have increasingly taken part in the illegal business.</p>
<p>Overdoses of the opioid killed more than 100,000 people in the 2022 U.S. fiscal year, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended in the March 22 letter efforts to curb supply of the drug, while rounding on U.S. critics, some of whom want Washington to intervene militarily in Mexico.</p>
<p>The letter and China's response did not mention supplies of the precursor chemicals used to make the powerful sedative.</p>
<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says both finished fentanyl and precursors are transported from China to Mexico, the United State and Canada, often by international mail.</p>

<p>Russia introduced severe punishments for discrediting the armed forces after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, laws that have snared dissidents, journalists, actors, musicians and even comedians.</p>
<p>Just hours before a court was due to hold a hearing over the parental rights of the girl's father, Russia's children's rights commissioner said that she had spoken to the girl's mother who had collected her from social care.</p>
<p>The girl's father, Alexei Moskalyov, was convicted of discrediting the armed forces and given a two-year jail term, leaving his daughter Maria, or Masha in the diminutive, in the hands of the state as her mother, according to legal documents seen by Reuters, had lost all contact with her daughter.</p>
<p>Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova said she had spoken to the girl and to her mother, named Olga.</p>
<p>"Masha did not want to go to her mother at first, and her opinion is legally required to be taken into account. Now her position has changed – she told me this herself on the phone," Lvova-Belova said.</p>
<p>"Olga has already taken Masha from the social rehabilitation center," she said. "Let's hope that everything will work out for mom and daughter."</p>
<p>Lvova-Belova posted a picture of the girl and her mother sitting on a bed, looking into each other's eyes. Both were smiling.</p>
<p>"I am glad about the beginning of the reunion of daughter and mother," Lvova-Belova said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear why Maria's mother had not lived with the family for so long. Official custody documents from earlier in the year showed her mother uses a different surname.</p>
<p>'NO TO WAR'</p>
<p>The problems for Moskalyov began after his daughter drew a picture in a school art class last year that featured Russian missiles flying towards Ukraine and the slogans "Glory to Ukraine" and "No to Putin, no to war".</p>
<p>Secondary School Number 9 in Yefremov, 290 km south of Moscow, alerted the police who discussed the matter with both Moskalyov and his daughter, then 12.</p>
<p>More ominously, officers from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era Committee for State Security (KGB), also spoke to both father and daughter, Moskalyov's lawyer told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, social services got involved and Moskalyov was accused of poor parenting and fined. He was accused of discrediting the Russian armed forces in social media posts. He said his account had been hacked.</p>
<p>On March 1, he was detained and the next day a court placed him under house arrest. Maria was taken away and put into a children's home, despite a request from a detective that she be returned home.</p>
<p>Moskalyov went on the run and was arrested in Minsk. While on the run, he was sentenced in absentia to two years in a penal colony for discrediting the armed forces.</p>

Timeline: Saudi-Iranian ties - A history of ups and downs

<p>After years of hostility that fuelled conflicts across the Middle East, Tehran and Riyadh agreed to end their diplomatic rift and re-open embassies in a major deal facilitated by China last month.</p>
<p>Beijing's secret role in the breakthrough between Tehran and Riyadh shook up dynamics in the Middle East, where the United States was for decades the main mediator, flexing its security and diplomatic muscles.</p>
<p>1979 - IRANIAN REVOLUTION</p>
<p>\- Saudi Arabia’s rulers watch aghast as Iran's Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a fellow dynast, is toppled by Shi’ite Muslim clerics seen in Riyadh as determined to export their Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>1980-1988 - IRAN-IRAQ WAR</p>
<p>\- Iranians fume over Saudi support for Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, in which Baghdad uses chemical weapons.</p>
<p>1987-88 - MECCA</p>
<p>\- Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran are badly strained in July 1987 when 402 pilgrims, 275 of them Iranian, die during clashes in the Muslim holy city of Mecca. Protesters in Tehran occupy the Saudi embassy and set fire to Kuwait’s embassy. A Saudi diplomat dies in Tehran of wounds sustained when he falls out of an embassy window and Riyadh accuses Tehran of delaying his transfer to a hospital in Saudi Arabia. King Fahd severs ties with Iran in 1988. Relations are restored only in 1991.</p>
<p>1997 - SUMMIT</p>
<p>\- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah visits non-Arab Iran for an Islamic summit in December, becoming the highest-ranking Saudi to do so since the Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>1999 - BETTER TIMES</p>
<p>\- Saudi King Fahd congratulates Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on his election victory in 2001, saying it is an endorsement of his reformist policy. Khatami had worked for rapprochement with Riyadh after his first landslide win in 1997. Khatami visits Saudi Arabia, the first such trip since 1979. Better relations are sealed with a security pact in April 2001.</p>
<p>2003-2012 - RISE IN REGIONAL TENSIONS</p>
<p>\- The 2003 U.S.-led invasion that topples Saddam Hussein in Iraq empowers the country’s Shi’ite majority and results in a shift in its political alignment towards Iran.</p>
<p>\- The 2005 assassination of Lebanon's Rafik al-Hariri, a close Saudi ally, sets the stage for a power struggle in Beirut pitting Iran and its allies on the one hand, including Syria, and U.S.-allied, Sunni-led Gulf Arab states on the other. Lebanon falls increasingly under the sway of the heavily armed, Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Some 15 years later, a U.N.-backed court convicts three Hezbollah members in absentia over the Hariri killing. The group denies any role, describing the tribunal as a tool in the hands of its enemies.</p>
<p>\- The 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah hardens Saudi suspicions that Tehran is creating new regional alliances threatening Saudi interests.</p>
<p>\- Iran’s disputed nuclear energy programme deepens Saudi fears that Tehran, under Khatami’s hardline nationalist successor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is bent on dominating the Gulf region.</p>
<p>\- According to a Wikileaks cable, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah tells his own diplomats in 2008 that he wants the United States to “cut off the head of the snake”.</p>
<p>2011 - ARAB SPRING</p>
<p>\- Saudi Arabia looks on in horror as pro-democracy uprisings moved eastward from Tunisia and Egypt to the Gulf. Protests in Bahrain are seen as a red line because of fears the island’s Shi’ite majority will take power and ally with Iran.</p>
<p>\- Saudi troops help put down Bahraini Shi’ite unrest at the request of Bahrain’s Sunni royal family.</p>
<p>\- Saudi Arabia accuses some Shi’ites in its Eastern Province of cooperating with a foreign state - meaning Iran - to sow dissent, after clashes between police and Shi’ites.</p>
<p>\- The United States says it has uncovered an Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Riyadh said the evidence was overwhelming and Tehran would pay a price. Iran rejects the report as a fabrication aimed at driving a wedge between Tehran and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>2011 - SYRIAN WAR, U.S.-IRAN THAW, NUCLEAR TALKS</p>
<p>\- Moderate Hassan Rouhani is elected Iranian president in June 2013 and turns Iran’s hitherto confrontational foreign policy in a conciliatory direction. Iran strikes an interim deal with big powers in November to limit its nuclear activity. Relations between Iran and most Gulf Arab neighbours improve.</p>
<p>\- The Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council calls in December for good neighbourly relations with Iran based on “non-interference in internal affairs”.</p>
<p>\- But Iranian-Saudi ties remain icy, with their regional power struggle reflected in the Syrian civil war. Riyadh is a leading supporter of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is a close ally of Tehran.</p>
<p>\- In 2015, Saudi Arabia intervenes in Yemen at the head of a Western-backed coalition against the Houthi movement after the Iran-aligned group ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa. The war has been in military stalemate for years.</p>
<p>2016 - TIES DETERIORATE</p>
<p>\- Saudi Arabia executes nearly 50 people including prominent Shi'ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr on Jan. 2, 2016. Protesters in Tehran storm the Saudi embassy and Shi’ite Iran’s top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vows "divine vengeance" for Nimr's execution.</p>
<p>\- Saudi Arabia cuts ties with Iran on Jan. 3.</p>
<p>\- Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of air strikes on its embassy in Yemen on Jan. 7. Saudi officials dismiss the claim as propaganda.</p>
<p>\- On May 29, 2016, Iran bans its pilgrims from attending the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage, blaming Saudi Arabia for "sabotage" and failing to guarantee the safety of pilgrims.</p>
<p>2019 TO PRESENT DAY</p>
<p>\- On Sept. 14, 2019, Saudi Arabia blames Iran for attacks on its oil installations that knocked out half of the kingdom's supply. Iran denies involvement; Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group claims responsibility for the attacks.</p>
<p>\- On Jan. 3, 2020, Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian military commander, is killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.</p>
<p>\- On April 9, 2021, Iran and Saudi Arabia hold their first direct talks since the rupture, hosted by Baghdad. Between April 2021 and September 2022, four rounds of talks are held, mostly mediated by Iraq and Oman.</p>
<p>\- Iran pulls out of the talks on March 13, 2022, ahead of a planned fifth round, a day after mass executions in Saudi Arabia that activists said included 41 Shi'ite Muslims.</p>
<p>\- Iran and Saudi Arabia hold a fifth round of talks on April 21, 2022.</p>
<p>\- On Oct. 19, 2022, the top adviser to Iran's Khamenei calls for reopening of Saudi, Iranian embassies.</p>
<p>\- Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Saudi Arabia on Dec. 9, 2022, and holds talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>\- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi visits China on Feb. 16, 2023, to meet Xi.</p>
<p>\- Iran and Saudi Arabia on March 11, 2023, agree to re-establish relations in deal brokered by China after years of hostility.</p>

Access to cheap Russian crude has boosted output and profits at Indian refineries, enabling them to export refined products competitively to Europe and take bigger market share.</p>

Mexican president criticizes Trump felony charges

<img src="https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33417532&width=980"/><br/><br/><div class="nordot-body"><p>By Brendan O'Boyle</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday said he does not agree with the criminal charges brought against former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"Supposedly legal issues should not be used for electoral, political purposes," Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. "That's why I don't agree with what they are doing to ex-President Trump."</p>
<p>Trump was charged on Tuesday with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a historic case over allegations he orchestrated hush-money payments to two women before the 2016 U.S. election to suppress publication of their sexual encounters with him.</p>
<p>Trump, the first sitting or former U.S. president to face criminal charges, pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Leftist populist Lopez Obrador compared Trump's case to the December ouster of former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office and arrested after trying to dissolve congress.</p>
<p>"It should be the people who decide," said Lopez Obrador, who said he could not say whether Trump was guilty or not.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador, who took office in 2018, developed a friendly working relationship with then-counterpart Trump, despite the U.S. president launching his election campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans rapists and drug runners and promising to make Mexico pay for a border wall.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador in November publicly called for Twitter to reinstate Trump's then-banned account on the social media platform.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador's motivations for defending Trump may be personal.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2004, Lopez Obrador, then the mayor of Mexico City and the frontrunner for Mexico's presidential election in 2006, was the subject of a judicial process that he said was a political plot by Mexico's then-President Vicente Fox.</p>
<p>The federal government's ultimately unsuccessful effort to put Lopez Obrador on trial for charges of contempt of court threatened to keep him from running for president.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador went on to lose the 2006 and 2012 presidential election - results he did not accept, alleging massive voter fraud.</p>

"And the blocking vote (against the far-right) would be much lower."</p><p>He said Le Pen's gains were "spectacular" and "she would progress in all electoral categories."</p><p>Sananes stressed that the polling was hypothetical and the results should not be over-interpreted, given that the next presidential election is four years away and Macron will be ineligible to run again.</p><p>But the results give a snapshot of changing dynamics in French politics, with Le Pen widely seen as the biggest winner from months of protests over Macron's unpopular bid to raise the retirement age to 64 from 62 currently.</p><p>Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has backed protesters and strikers, has lost support, the Elabe poll and another on Monday by the Ifop-Fiducial survey group suggested.</p><p>The Ifop-Fiducial survey group also found a sharp increase in support for Le Pen, who has made clear she intends to stand for president for a fourth time in 2027.</p><p>Politicians across the spectrum have repeatedly warned in recent months that the 54-year-old stands to gain from the turmoil sweeping the country, as well as longstanding concerns about crime and immigration.</p><p>Le Pen has kept a relatively low-profile during huge protests and strikes, keeping her public statements to a minimum and maintaining discipline among her 88 MPs in parliament who form the largest single opposition group.</p><p>"At least I've succeeded in winning over my political opponents," Le Pen quipped to AFP in an interview last month. "They seem to spend their lives telling everyone that I will be the next president."</p><p>The prospect of the far-right leader succeeding Macron at the next election in 2027 is said by allies to gnaw at the 45-year-old president.</p><p>"It's the issue that haunts Emmanuel," a senior lawmaker who knows the president well told AFP recently.</p><p>© 2023 AFP</p>

<p>Now the ancient Egyptian ruler is back in France to go on display in Paris as part of the travelling exhibition "Ramses and the Gold of the Pharaohs."</p>
<p>The exhibition, which has already stopped in San Francisco and Houston in the US, is the only site where the sarcophagus will join the tour.</p>
<p>France greatly appreciates this trust by Egypt, said French Minister Rima Abdul Malak on Monday at the unveiling of the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>The fact that it is back in Paris after more than 40 years is also proof of the excellent relationship between the two countries, she added.</p>
<p>The wooden coffin was taken out of a high-security transport crate at the Grande Halle de la Villette, where it will be the highlight of the exhibition from April 7 onwards.</p>
<p>Until September 6, over 180 objects from the reign of Ramses will be presented, including royal masks, statues and jewellery. Ramses II is considered one of the most important pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>He was born around 1303 BC and died in 1213 BC. Ruling for 66 years, he was one of the longest reigning heads of state in the world. He had numerous palaces and temples built, such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel.</p>
<p>In 1976, the sarcophagus was received like a head of state - with a red carpet and much pomp. While the wooden coffin was on display in the Grand Palais in Paris, scientists treated the mummy with radiation against its increasing decay caused by bacteria and moisture.</p>
