<h3><strong><em>How Cisco Secure Endpoint can protect you now and into the future</em></strong></h3>
<p>As the way the world works continues to shift, we are driving towards the delivery of the <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/how-to-leverage-cisco-security-cloud-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Security Cloud</a>. Our cloud-based, integrated platform will secure and connect organizations of any shape and size to accommodate constant changes in business, technology, and the threat landscape. It will enable organizations to be more adaptable and flexible while remaining protected and resilient.</p>
<p>Leading up to this transformation, I have used <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/author/eletzeri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blogs</a> to highlight some of the key pillars that will make up our integrated platform — including SASE, XDR, and zero trust. One technology that cuts across all these main focus areas, which I haven’t discussed much before, is <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/endpoint-security/secure-endpoint/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Secure Endpoint</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b>The evolution of endpoint security</b> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/endpoint-security/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endpoint security solutions</a> safeguard desktops, laptops, mobile, and IoT devices from compromise. Since endpoints are a popular attack vector for gaining access to the network and sensitive assets, endpoint defense has become a critical component of a comprehensive security portfolio. Trends such as cloud computing, hybrid work, increasingly sophisticated attacks, and a cybersecurity skills shortage put endpoints and unsuspecting users at risk.</p>
<p>With a greater attack surface and a wider variety of threats, endpoint security has had to evolve over the years. Point solutions for every type of threat no longer work. Today’s security solutions must combine more than one technology for complete protection. Furthermore, they must integrate with other types of security capabilities to deliver the end-to-end visibility and context needed to secure a modern, multi-cloud environment.</p>
<p>Cisco Secure Endpoint provides protection, detection, response, and user access coverage in a single solution. The cloud-native technology blocks malware, and swiftly detects, contains, and remediates advanced attacks that evade front-line defenses. Through <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/advanced-malware-protection/at-a-glance-c45-731874.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multifaceted prevention and detection techniques</a>, Cisco Secure Endpoint continuously works to eradicate threats from endpoints and stop them from infiltrating other parts of the network.</p>
<p>Blocking threats at the earliest point in time ensures minimal damage to endpoints and less downtime after a breach. However, thwarting all attacks before they take hold is no longer a reality, so we combine our prevention techniques with <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/endpoint-security/what-is-endpoint-detection-response-edr-medr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endpoint detection and response (EDR)</a> to rapidly contain threats that find their way into your ecosystem.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-secure-endpoint-crushed-the-av-comparative-epr-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test by AV–Comparatives</a>, Cisco Secure Endpoint was <strong>ranked as a Strategic Leader in endpoint prevention and response</strong> for both its efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Secure Endpoint was the only product tested that stopped 100% of 50 targeted attack scenarios, and was also found to have the lowest total cost of ownership over a five-year period.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b>Comprehensive endpoint protection </b> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Secure</a> leverages advanced functionality including machine learning, forensics, threat hunting, and automation to speed investigation and mitigation. Secure Endpoint also offers a variety of additional features that go beyond other industry solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure Endpoint is powered by the unparalleled global threat intelligence of <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-talos-our-not-so-secret-threat-intel-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Talos</a>, delivering continuously updated coverage for the latest attacks. With Talos, we stop more threats than any other security provider.</li>
<li>Built-in <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-xdr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDR capabilities</a> ensure that Secure Endpoint is not working in a silo. Instead, insights across various Cisco and third-party security technologies are correlated and analyzed for more holistic threat visibility and containment.</li>
<li>If you don’t want to manage endpoint security operations on your own, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/secure-mdr-for-endpoint.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Secure MDR for Endpoint</a> provides always-on operations managed by Cisco experts. The team will investigate every threat and respond in minutes, keeping your devices secure while you focus on other priorities.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/announcing-risk-based-endpoint-security-with-cisco-secure-endpoint-and-kenna-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration with Kenna Security</a>, customers gain risk-based vulnerability context within Cisco Secure Endpoint. This additional level of insight allows for better prioritization and accelerated investigation and remediation of endpoint threats.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b>Boosting resilience through the endpoint </b> </span></h2>
<p>Cisco Secure Endpoint has recently garnered <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/third-party-validation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant industry recognition</a> for its advanced functionality that increases organizational resilience.</p>

<p>Customers are sharing their successes as well. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/case-studies-customer-success-stories/pima-community-college.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pima Community College</a>, for example, is securing nearly 10,000 endpoints with Cisco. “Higher education is an inherently unique environment because every day we face the dichotomy between open access for students and teachers, whose work requires broad access to the internet, and our back-end systems, where we need to keep things a bit tighter and similar to a corporate environment,” says Scott McGowan, security architect at Pima Community College.</p>
<p><strong>With Cisco, the college’s security alerts have been reduced from 300 a day to just two or three. </strong>“Secure Endpoint&#8217;s powerful EDR capabilities provided accurate telemetry for [our] devices,” said McGowan. “And, in one case, detected an artifact of a ransomware infection simply based on the encrypted file for that ransomware.”</p>

<p>Cisco Secure has also enabled <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/case-studies-customer-success-stories/procellis-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Procellis Technology</a> to strengthen its security. In a short time, <strong>Secure Endpoint has helped the company stop over half a dozen potential compromises per month and identified dozens of vulnerable applications.</strong></p>
<p>“There are a bunch of different attack vectors that are prevented, and anything that blocks an attack doesn’t bring our resources down in the first place, which improves our uptime, which makes us more productive,” said Nate Haleen, the lead developer and division lead for programming at Procellis.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b>Safeguard your devices, enhance your defenses</b> </span></h2>
<p>Through robust functionality and deep integrations, Cisco Secure Endpoint customers can <strong>reduce remediation times by as much as 85 percent</strong> (or up to 97% when combined with built-in XDR capabilities). And according to a <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/forrester-tei-of-endpoint.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by Forrester Consulting</a>, customers can achieve a <strong>287% return on investment for Secure Endpoint in three years, with a payback period of less than six months.</strong></p>
<p>As we get closer to unveiling the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/security-cloud/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Security Cloud</a>, the foundational capabilities and new enhancements in Secure Endpoint will play a pivotal role in delivering the next generation of security.

Set out to define what security resilience means in the real world—with real programs—and more importantly, codify how organizations are building it successfully.
## content:encoded
## #cdata-section
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With technology advancement at our heels and years of global pandemic pandemonium mostly (hopefully) behind us, resilience has fast become a hot topic. Why? Because organizations are searching for </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">solutions that will help them respond</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to intensifying changes and threats in ways that protect all the investments they&#8217;ve made in their business. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But what does resilience mean anyway, especially to security professionals? Cisco set out to define what </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-resilience.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">security resilience</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> means in the real world—with real programs—and more importantly, codify how organizations are building it successfully.

The findings uncovered </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">seven success factors to achieving security resilience—factors so essential that, if all are successfully implemented, they could push an organization&#8217;s resilience levels from the bottom 10th percentile to the top 10th.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> (I mean, which percentile would you rather be in?)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Those seven factors are:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<li><span data-contrast="auto">Executive support</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

</ol>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Resilience is more than a buzzword, and this report backs up that assertion with some compelling findings. To dig deeper into those findings, I sat down with Cisco Secure’s CISO Helen Patton (one of my personal idols). We discussed her perspective on key elements of the report. Here’s what Helen had to say.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="1"><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Helen Patton’s takeaways from the Security Outcomes Report, Vol. 3 </strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>Tell us about the report! Can you give us some background information?</i></b> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Three years ago, we started with the </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomes-report-vol-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">first version of the security outcomes series</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to find out what actually worked in security and what actions led to positive outcomes. We came up with a list of what people were doing that had a positive security program outcome. Then we did </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomes-report-vol-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">another study the following year</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> where we dove deep into those top five actions to better understand how they achieved those positive outcomes. But over time, we’ve seen a lot of executive awareness of cybersecurity and what that means for the business. So, </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomes-report.html?utm_medium=web-referral&amp;utm_source=blog5&amp;utm_campaign=umb-fy23-q2-content-ebook-security-outcomes-report-v3&amp;utm_content=umb-fy23-q2-content-ebook-security-outcomes-report-v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">for the report</span></a><b><span data-contrast="auto">,</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> we are really exploring what it means to be security resilient, what activities security teams can do to help an organization be resilient, and most importantly, what actually works.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>Why do you think “security resilience” has become such a buzzword?</i></b> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You see it everywhere! I think everyone struggles with what the value of security is. A lot of the time we think we do security because we have to, or because a regulator is telling us to. But the point of security is that if we do it well, an organization is free to do what an organization does. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">How do we use security as an underpinning and enabler for all the things an organization does? In short, we build security resilience.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>Do you mind sharing some of those key resilience priorities that organizations are looking to achieve?</i></b> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomes-report.html?utm_medium=web-referral&amp;utm_source=blog5&amp;utm_campaign=umb-fy23-q2-content-ebook-security-outcomes-report-v3&amp;utm_content=umb-fy23-q2-content-ebook-security-outcomes-report-v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The outcomes report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> came out with seven things that an organization could do that would really make a difference in terms of their security program. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">One of the main things is getting executive buy-in and sponsorship</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. If an organization isn’t completely all-in with your security program, it really isn’t secure. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Others were </span><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/why-zero-trust-helps-unlock-security-resilience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">maturing zero trust</span></a> <span data-contrast="auto">and moving to the cloud. But moving to the cloud quickly. There’s certainly resilience if you’re 100% on-premise or 100% in the cloud, but if you’ve got hybrid space, actually organizations’ resilience scores went down by about 15%. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">The report didn’t suggest you not go to the cloud, but be intentional when you do. Don’t end up in that mushy, hybrid middle of the road, which is actually really hard to secure</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. What last year’s report would suggest is to have a specific program to get rid of old security technology and adopt something that is more protected and more updated that will allow things like automation and new solutions to be deployed across your organization to help with resilience. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>In light of the global cybersecurity talent shortage, why do you think it ranks lowest as a priority?</i></b> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I suspect it&#8217;s because solving the talent shortage is the hardest thing to do. </span><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/can-you-hire-your-way-to-security-resilience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Hiring and retaining security talent</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> was ranked the most difficult of these seven security resilience activities for everybody across the board, no matter the size of the company or the location. It’s easier to talk about having the right tooling, the right architectures, the right kind of board engagement. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The problem of security talent retention is impacting everybody everywhere and it’s a difficult, thorny problem. But we all know if we don’t have that talent, we can’t be resilient. So, we need as a collective community to be able to resolve this problem. And that’s going to take </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">partnership between government, academia, and the private sector to bring in and train up people to be security people</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">—whether or not they’ve got security in their title.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>Any recommendations for hiring and retaining cybersecurity talent? You talk about this a lot in your book,</i></b> <a style="color: #6abf4b;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigating-Cybersecurity-Career-Path-Insider/dp/1119833426"><b><i>Navigating the Cybersecurity Career Path</i></b></a><b>.</b> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s been a number of reports industry-wide on this. It’s really hard to train an employee to be curious, innovative, and self-studied. So you hire for that and you train on the job. If you don&#8217;t have people with the skills to train someone on the job, then you reach out to resources like </span><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_sg/partners/cisco-networking-academy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Cisco Academy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or someone like me who comes in and talks with your teams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">We need to hire for capability and potential, not tech or security background</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Don’t get me wrong, there are some jobs where you absolutely need security experience. But there are plenty of people who have project management experience, business analyst experience, and math experience.</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> Some of my best security people were musicians by trade.</span></b> <b><span data-contrast="auto">We need to be moving people laterally into security, not only straight up through high school. We’ve got to be coming in from both directions because the need is too great. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><b><i>How do the experiences of executives and security professionals in the field differ when it comes to security resilience?</i></b> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One finding I thought was interesting came from asking both C-suite security people and professionals who are the “doers” of security what resilience outcome they valued the most. We found that the </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">security executives’ highest priority was actually not preventing incidents, but mitigating the risk</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> and financial cost of an incident actually occurring. Whereas the s</span><b><span data-contrast="auto">ecurity doers wanted to prevent any bad thing from happening at all</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Both of those things were valuable, but we do have a bit of a mismatch in priorities. This also explains why it’s sometimes hard for security people to talk about security with executives, because what they want from programs is a little different. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><i>As a CISO, do you have any personal thoughts about the findings?</i> </span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re a CISO and you’re trying to roll out a security program, often executives will come to you and ask you how what you’re doing compares to what other people are doing. They ask you to benchmark your work. And the challenge with benchmarking is that every organization does security differently because the business they’re in is different.  Even if it’s the same industry, your risk appetite is different. Let’s say you’re in healthcare—the risk appetite of your hospital might be different from the risk appetite of another hospital. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So trying to benchmark by looking at other organizations is not comparing apples to apples, but here in Australia it’s apples to marsupials.</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> This report doesn’t limit you to a numerical benchmark but gives you the ability to look at what similar organizations are doing that statistically generate positive outcomes</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So now I can choose my own path from the report. If I want to improve executive buy-in, this is how I might do it. If I want to improve the cloud, this is how I might do it. If I need to then sell that to my executives, rather than saying I’ve done a benchmark, </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">we can choose a strategy that’s got the rigor of this report backing it up</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. So that’s how I would use this report as a practitioner.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>These findings are actionable. </strong></span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What we love about the Security Outcomes Report is that it takes more than a data-centric approach—the </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">results are completely actionable</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">We practice good security hygiene, communicate between executives and front-liners, move forward with tech advancements, train up new cybersecurity professionals, and so much more to achieve security resilience</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. But why? What is all this effort for?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I think Helen really drove the answer home. To paraphrase this wise CISO, we’re taking these actions because if we do them well, we’re enabling organizations to do what they do best, unencumbered. That, after all, is why a resilient security function is so vital.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s safe to say that workplace cybersecurity is complicated. Hybrid work is the norm, with millions of remote workers connecting to applications and resources from places all over the globe every day, as well as contractors and vendors logging on from unmanaged devices.

<p><span data-contrast="none">And, most businesses are deep into the transition to a multi-cloud world, where IaaS resources and SaaS applications dominate. With each of these trends and transitions, complexity increases, and potential gaps in security open.

<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">The SSE promise </span></strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/sase-and-sse-what-you-need-to-know"><span data-contrast="none">Security service edge (SSE)</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> represents a new converged, cloud-centric approach that delivers a unified set of security capabilities that provide secure access to the web, cloud services, and private applications. It combines capabilities like secure web gateway (SWG), zero trust network access (ZTNA), firewall-as-a-service technologies, and cloud access security broker (CASB) into one cloud-delivered service.  SSE can protect your organization from threats, can scale easily, and can reduce complexity — no matter where employees log in. In many ways, it’s the answer to the security challenges of a dynamic, hybrid workplace. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">Where SSE is today</span></strong></h2>
<p>SSE has delivered some great outcomes, there are still some shortcomings where there’s room for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficacy: SSE solutions today focus on a handful of security capabilities, such as SWG, CASB, etc. These are vital, no question. Yet in many cases, they’re not enough. Other capabilities like DNS-layer security, remote browser isolation (RBI), extended detection and response (XDR) increase the protection. If these aren’t part of the SSE solution, organizations will add other products, increasing integration and orchestration challenges. When multiple vendors are involved, these challenges grow further, leading to inconsistency in security policy definition and enforcement which opens security gaps.</li>
<li>Complex IT user experience: IT leaders are plagued with the challenges of integrating solutions from different vendors, such as juggling multiple management consoles and many agents/clients. They struggle to define and enforce policies consistently when managing multiple vendors and solutions. Providing secure access to private apps often requires multiple approaches, likely VPN alongside ZTNA, to enable protection of all (not just some) apps.</li>
<li>Inconsistent end user experience: Users expect the same experience and performance when they access the apps and data they need to do their jobs, from wherever they work, whether it’s the office or the airport. Yet with most SSE solutions today, users must use multiple access methods, deal with inconsistent connectivity processes, and may get poor performance from some locations. This leads to frustration and lack of productivity, yet traditionally, end user experience concerns haven’t been high on the SSE priority list.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">Cisco’s way: Reaching the full potential of SSE</span></strong></h2>
<p>Deeply encoded in Cisco&#8217;s DNA is a drive to push past the fundamentals and dig deep into what&#8217;s possible.  As we develop SSE solutions, we are constantly pushing ourselves to think beyond just delivering the basics of SSE. We wrestle with questions that push us to design solutions that are better for users, easier for IT, and safer for everyone. Here are a few core thoughts that we think are essential.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSE is a crucial part in a much bigger picture: Connectivity and security are two sides of the same coin, which is why SD-WAN cloud networking and a <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/solutions/secure-access-service-edge-sase/index.html">secure access service edge</a> (SASE) architecture are often talked about as the fully realized version of modern security and networking.</li>
<li>It is about convergence, but in a much wider sense: Converging security functionality in the cloud, in a single service, improves security while simplifying management. But it&#8217;s more than this. Vendor consolidation further streamlines and simplifies the security landscape by deepening integration, increasing coordination of threat detection and response, and simplifying management via centralized approaches.</li>
<li>Looking beyond traditional SSE: For a product to be an SSE solution, it has to include a handful of core functionality. But why stop there? How much simpler and safer would security be if you could also deliver XDR, EDR, RBI, pervasive threat intelligence, end-to-end visibility, and even more from one security cloud platform?</li>
<li>Secure access you can trust across every point of service: Our goal isn’t just to deliver a certain set of security capabilities, but true secure access across the whole ecosystem. Our <a href="https://umbrella.cisco.com/cisco-umbrella-global-cloud-architecture">global cloud architecture</a> delivers high performance and low latency for users, while processing more than 5 billion web reputation requests per day and blocking more than 170 million malicious DNS queries per day. Our security efficacy is part of why we’re trusted by 100% of the Fortune 100.</li>
<li>Driving customer outcomes: As a technology company, we can create solutions with dozens of capabilities, but if we’re not solving real issues and protecting organizations from actual threats, then we haven’t been successful. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/hitachi-ltd-case-study.html">Hitachi</a>, for instance, was looking to secure a hypermobile workforce of 167,000 employees, along with an abundance of devices, systems, and data inside and outside of their corporate network. With Cisco, they were able to build a scalable zero trust architecture with behavior detection and access control on computers, smartphones, factory devices, and network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether your security challenges include the need to protect all site locations and roaming users, flexibly pivot with business shifts, or simplify and integrate across your security environment, SSE can help you achieve the security resilience needed today and into the future.</p>

Learn about the 2023 Gartner® Market Guide for Network Detection and Response trends and why Cisco is listed as a Representative Vendor.
## content:encoded
## #cdata-section
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2CO7LHSM&amp;ct=230224&amp;st=sb">2023 Gartner</a></span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2CO7LHSM&amp;ct=230224&amp;st=sb"><span data-contrast="none">®</span></a><span data-contrast="none"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2CO7LHSM&amp;ct=230224&amp;st=sb"> Market Guide for Network Detection and Response</a>, Cisco is listed as a Representative Vendor. A Market Guide defines a market and explains what clients can expect it to do in the short term. With the focus on early, more chaotic markets, a Market Guide does not rate or position vendors within the market, but rather more commonly outlines attributes of representative vendors that are providing offerings in the market to give further insight into the market itself. If you&#8217;re trying to figure out how a new market might fit in with your company&#8217;s present and future technological needs, we believe the Gartner Market Guide report</span><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="none"> are a great place to start.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to Gartner, network detection and response (NDR) refers to tools that perform behavioral analytics on data collected from a network&#8217;s traffic in order.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p>The trusted analysts from Gartner observe that the network detection and response (NDR) market continue to grow steadily at 22.5%, despite increased competition from other platforms. The steady growth of the NDR market is a sign that the reach of these tools includes enhanced analytical capabilities and response tactics, thanks to the development of machine learning. In addition to the use of sophisticated machine learning models, cloud architectures make it possible to perform extensive real-time analysis on the large volumes of data produced by enterprise networks. What this means is that security experts are beginning to take notice of the technology as it begins to fulfill its promise.</p>
<p>Trends in the NDR market, according to Gartner, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New sensors:</strong> By building or integrating with endpoint sensors, such as EDR, ingesting third-party logs like SIEM, analyzing software/platform/infrastructure-as-a-service events through their monitoring APIs, or adding support for OT use cases.</li>
<li><strong>New detection techniques:</strong> By adding support for more traditional signatures, performance monitoring, threat intelligence and sometimes malware detection engines. This move toward more multifunction network detection aligns well with the use case of network/security operations convergence, but also with midsize enterprises.</li>
<li><strong>Incident response workflow automation:</strong> NDR technologies already aggregate individual abnormal events into security incidents. By enriching alerts to provide better context and applying ML to semiautomate the incident response process, NDR vendors encourage large SOC teams to rely more on the NDR console, rather than forwarding alerts directly to a SIEM.</li>
<li><strong>Managed NDR: </strong>Some of the large vendors have started offering more services on top of the NDR product and subscriptions, ranging from proactive notifications from the vendors in case of incident to fully managed threat detection. Many of these services are recent and supported by small but growing teams.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving architecture: </strong>More vendors provide ML analytics only in the cloud now, as the centralized approach facilitates improvement of ML detections.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you oversee or work in the trenches of security operations today, you are most likely using a slew of detection products from various vendors, which can be perplexing. This necessitates manually hunting and investigating incidents across multiple toolkits, which can take a long time and frequently leads to dead ends or roadblocks. The Gartner Market Guide for Network Detection and Response mentions that Security and risk management leaders should prioritize NDR as complementary to other detection tools, focusing on low false positive rates and detection of anomalies that other controls don’t cover.</p>

When we design for vulnerable groups, we get a better product for all. Learn how we collaborated with Schoolab. 
## content:encoded
## #cdata-section
<p>When we design for underrepresented communities, we get a better product for all. This principle is the north star of inclusive design and is deeply connected to Cisco’s purpose. Cisco strives to design and build technology in ways that respect human rights, promote inclusion, and protect privacy and security, so that everyone can benefit from a more connected world.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;When we design for vulnerable communities and personas, we end up having a better product that more people can benefit<br />
from. This is why Inclusive and accessible design plays a critical role in and across the product development lifecycle</em>.” </strong><br />
<strong>—Maulie Dass, Cisco Innovation Labs Director</strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>One team creating this connected world through inclusive design is the Cisco Secure Design team. Their Accessibility Research Program teaches Cisco Duo designers to conduct interviews and usability tests with people with disabilities, exposing them to a foundational understanding of assistive technology and how people use products, beyond the usual focus on sighted users with a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8220;We empower people to think critically about task flows and features by engaging closely with people who use assistive technology. It&#8217;s great for empathy building, but more importantly, it challenges the preconceived ideas of how one might complete a task on an app or website.&#8221;<br />
</em><strong><em>—Kaush Ganesh, Senior Duo Design Researcher for Cisco Secure</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Including the voices of people with disabilities in the product development process helps ensure Cisco Secure is designing products that don’t just meet legal requirements but give everyone a great, well thought out user experience.”<br />
</em><strong><em>—Colin Fulton, Duo Accessibility Specialist in Cisco Secure</em></strong></p>
<p>Currently, Duo’s authentication process has screen reader capabilities, but Cisco prioritizes creating an experience that excels basic functionality to provide the best experience with our products. Always looking for ways to optimize authentication, the Cisco Secure team joined forces with <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/country-digital-acceleration.html">Country Digital Acceleration</a> (CDA) and <a href="https://eti.cisco.com/cil">Cisco Innovation Lab</a> to partner with university students for an inclusive design opportunity. Schoolab’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifi6zP_fn8AhW1GTQIHdiAAHUQFnoECA0QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.theschoolab.com%2Fexpertise%2Fequitable-design-lab%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw31e9du04UyFXn1xpcA8TB1">Equitable Design Lab</a>, a course ran through the University of California, Berkeley, teaches students to center on the importance of equity in the design process through a collaboration of students and industry experts in tackling real-world challenges. Cisco took the opportunity to ask the question to the students of how we might make cybersecurity more accessible and inclusive for users with visual disabilities.</p>
<p>Tasked with this equitable opportunity statement, the two student teams: Team 1 and Team A, spent three months following an inclusive design process by conducting user research with blind and hard-of-seeing communities, including Cisco’s Connected Disabilities Action Network members. In the culmination of a semester proximate to their target user, the student teams proposed user-driven solutions leveraging proximity authentication and haptic feedback authentication.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><em>“We were excited to work with the Berkeley design students because even though we are creating an inclusive design program internally, having an outside perspective helps find new solutions and discover opportunities we have missed.”<br />
<strong>– Colin Fulton, Duo Accessibility Specialist in Cisco Secure</strong></em></p>
<p>While Cisco Secure won’t be immediately implementing the projects due to security standards and implementation complications, these projects have sparked conversations about related improvements and will influence future product work. The proposals inspired the team to reevaluate the design of some parts of verified pushes, they are investigating authentication methods that can improve security while also being easier for people with and without disabilities to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><em>“I was impressed by the caliber of questions the students asked when exploring the challenge. Security design is an exciting space to explore, and being inclusive is extremely important because security and usability go hand in hand.”<br />
<strong>—Kaush Ganesh, Senior Duo Design Researcher for Cisco Secure</strong></em></p>
<p>Beyond new design considerations, collaborating with Berkeley’s students gave Cisco a chance to support the next generation of designers by introducing them to the questions they should be asking in their careers to create inclusive products for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">“Designing something for someone that we do not identify with taught us how to question, listen, observe, and empathize. It was heartwarming and proud to hear the people we interviewed respond so positively to our ideas on creating a better user experience. “<br />
<strong>—UC Berkeley Equitable Design Lab Masters Student</strong></p>
<p>Accessibility work is never done. As seen through the value of Cisco&#8217;s multi-team collaboration with Schoolab, organizations must tackle inclusive design opportunities with a lens of empathy for the users and intentionality of whose voices are and are not considered. It is through this discipline that we can improve our technology and design for a world to empower all.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Cisco Secure is always open to customer feedback concerning accessibility. If anyone encounters accessibility issues with Duo products, please ask your Cisco Secure representative to put you in touch with Duo’s accessibility research team. Your feedback helps Cisco Secure democratize security and create great user experiences for everyone.</p>

## #cdata-section
<p>Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) hasn’t been around for <em>that</em> long but it has been around long enough that if you aren’t familiar with it, it can be a bit intimidating to learn the basics and get your questions answered.</p>
<p>The good news is that Cisco understands this predicament and is offering a one-hour webinar called “ISE 101 Basics”. The informal discussion will address Bridging Security and Enterprise Networking with ISE.</p>
<p>Whether you are new to ISE or just want a quick rehash of what the next generation Network Access Control (NAC) solution is all about, this webinar is must-see TV. Not only will you receive a better understanding what ISE is and how it can strengthen the security of your network, but you’ll also see why ISE is the market leader and learn all about the most recent ISE innovations.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you aren’t sure about the industry itself. In addition to focusing on ISE, the webinar will be sure to define NAC buzzwords and discuss where the industry will be heading in the future. The “ISE 101 Basics” agenda will touch on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How ISE is the foundation to Zero-Trust in network security.</li>
<li>How cloud-enabled ISE 3.2 is more competitive than ever.</li>
<li>The differentiators between Corporate and Guest users and their devices.</li>
<li>How to use ISE probes and Cisco network devices to classify endpoints and authorize them appropriately.</li>
<li>Creating a simple onboarding process that allows employees to use their own devices to access network resources.</li>
<li>Allowing group-based policies for segmentation of the network through the use of Scalable Group Tags and ACLS instead of VLAN/ACL segmentation.</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from all of the terrific information that you’ll absorb during the hour, the best thing about this webinar is that it will be presented by a pair of Cisco experts. Not only are they the tops in their field, but they will be answering your questions live during the call. It’s not often that you get a chance to talk to an expert about their product, so make sure you come with all of your questions.</p>

Learn from hiring managers and fellow engineers at Cisco about the soft skills that are most valuable in the field and how to showcase them in an interview.
## content:encoded
## #cdata-section
<p>We know that technical skills are essential for site reliability and software engineering positions. However, hiring managers take note when candidates display soft skills or qualities that are necessary for collaboration and innovation. Jaya Sistla, a site reliability engineering (SRE) manager, uses three words to describe the qualities she seeks in candidates and colleagues regardless of title or level: humble, hungry and skilled.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/derdr-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/derdr-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/derdr.jpg 935w' sizes='(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429831" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/derdr.jpg"   alt="" width="935" height="529" /></p>
<p>To ascertain these qualities, Sistla wants to know, “Are you a person who gets along with others in the team? Are you hungry to learn? Are you hungry to teach? Are you hungry to grow our business? Given a task, are you able to learn and perform?” she said. “Tech is always rapidly changing and growing, so if you have these three things in your character, then you will be able to catch up with technology.”</p>
<p>Read on to learn the top soft skills that site reliability and software engineering hiring managers seek out at Cisco — and if you’re humble, hungry and skilled, visit our <a href="http://duo.sc/security-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open roles</a>.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">1. Openness to differences of opinion.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Discussing not only what work is being done, but also how, is an important part of being an engineer in cybersecurity. That’s why, “it&#8217;s helpful to have a willingness to see other perspectives,” said Hanna Fernandez, a software engineer.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to be able to have a dialogue on other options&#8230; Luckily I feel like most of the people I work with are always super willing to engage with you in, ‘Well, this is where we’re coming from, this is what we were thinking of.’ And also, if you do propose an alternative, it’s going to have to meet these considerations,” she said.</p>
<p>Site Reliability Engineering Manager <a href="https://duo.com/blog/how-to-become-site-reliability-engineer-never-stop-growing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stacey Young</a> looks for people, “who are willing to have real discussions and people who like to learn. If you assume that you know all that there is to know about yourself, about the world in general, about the job that you do, you’re going to miss out on a lot,” she said.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdcfvgh-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdcfvgh-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdcfvgh-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429832" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdcfvgh-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">2. A love of learning, especially from others.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Learning is required to excel as an engineer in cybersecurity. While textbooks and courses provide excellent information and education, learning beyond the books stands out to hiring managers. “Throughout your career, it will always be an advantage to make sure that you are up to date and that you are always learning something new,” Guillaume Dury, an SRE manager, said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>“If you’re not willing to learn, you are not going to grow and the people around you aren&#8217;t going to grow either.” &#8211; Stacey Young</strong></span></h3>
<p>One way that Young has learned throughout her career is through relationships. “I love getting to know people, allowing them to get to know me, and being willing to learn in those relationships. If you’re not willing to learn, you are not going to grow and the people around you aren’t going to grow either,” she said.</p>
<p>For Mario Lopez, a senior software engineer, continuously learning is a vital part of the field. “You can’t know everything, and you don’t want to have learned everything. You want to constantly be improving and learning. There are so many different aspects to this field. It’s not just knowing how to program or code one specific aspect,” he said.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdfgh-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdfgh-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdfgh-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429833" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sdfgh-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<p>Learning doesn’t end with you. “It’s not just you learn yourself, but helping other folks and lifting them and learning and understanding and then collaborating is very important. A lot of the things that I’m looking for when I’m interviewing is, it’s not what you know, but what you will eventually learn and know and help others learn, too,” Lopez said.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>3. Responsibility and accountability.</strong></span></h2>
<p>When people take responsibility for and hold themselves accountable to previous work and processes, they stand out to hiring managers. David Rines, a senior engineering leader, wants people who are comforting using ‘we’ a lot when talking about their team and steer away from blame.</p>
<p><a href="https://duo.com/blog/what-site-reliability-engineering-for-duo-looks-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blake Ellingham</a>, an SRE manager, shared that sentiment. <strong>“</strong>Aside from the technical requirements that we have, it’s accountability and being able to take responsibility for things that go well and for things that don&#8217;t go well,” he said.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sezxdrcftvgybhuji-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sezxdrcftvgybhuji-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sezxdrcftvgybhuji-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429834" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/sezxdrcftvgybhuji-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<p>SRE Nick Aspinall explained that a resume is all about one’s successes, while an interview affords an important opportunity to talk about when things went wrong, how you’ve grown, and what you’ve learned from the experience. “I always like when people show that if they made a mistake, they’ve not only been able to take ownership of that mistake, but [also] been able to see how it occurred and how they can prevent that kind of thing from happening in the future,” he said. “A lot of the times I like to talk about people’s successes, but the failures are where people are defined, and that’s where you learn more about people than the successes.”</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">4. Working collaboratively to overcome challenges.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Challenges are a common part of any meaningful work, and how you handle them matters most. &#8220;We are always going to have issues that come up — that could be interpersonal, it could be technical, there’s going to be challenges —and how you work with team members through conflict and through challenges is really important,” shared Ellingham.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/awsxdrcftvgybhunj-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/awsxdrcftvgybhunj-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/awsxdrcftvgybhunj-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429835" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/awsxdrcftvgybhunj-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<p>Customer Data Experience Engineering Leader <a href="https://duo.com/blog/how-good-company-culture-shapes-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Vazquez</a> explained that part of working through challenges is combining kindness and honesty. “Folks who can be empathetic and sympathetic and kind, and care about others, and who can figure out how to deliver difficult feedback, or have a challenging conversation — those are good skills to have,” she said.</p>
<p>That capacity to approach challenges thoughtfully extends to asking questions when you need support. Lopez explained that the team is very open about sharing resources and knowledge. “Please don’t suffer in silence. Ask that question. Someone else may know the answer and will be happy to help you,” he said. “If they don’t know, other folks will jump in and say, ‘Let&#8217;s tackle this together.’ You don’t just spin your wheels trying to figure out something that you know shouldn’t try to be figuring out by yourself.”</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>5. Not a cultural fit, but a cultural add.</strong></span></h2>
<p>Contributing to our workplace culture matters a lot to hiring managers. “Whoever I’m hiring is going to impact team dynamics. They’re going to add to our team culture. It’s important to be aware of that and think about that,” said Vazquez.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zzesxrdctfvygbhu-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zzesxrdctfvygbhu-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zzesxrdctfvygbhu-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429836" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zzesxrdctfvygbhu-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<p>Sharing your perspectives and experiences <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/how-to-prepare-for-a-security-engineering-interview-be-yourself">in an interview</a> lets hiring managers see you more fully. “We look for people who are going to add to our culture, who have unique diversities that they can bring,” Ellingham said. “So, bring your full self. I’d love to hear more about what you can contribute to the culture and what your joys and what your passions are.”</p>
<p>Lopez put it this way: “It’s important to have those different perspectives and experiences, because when we all have those, we’re all learning from each other and we’re all growing together.”</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">6. Being humble.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Learning together, without ego, leads to healthy, growing, innovative teams. Vazquez explains: “The focus has to be on the work, understanding the problem that we’re trying to solve, and finding the right solution for that initiative,” she said. “Anything that’s not that is just really distracting.”</p>
<p>Of his experience at Cisco, Dury said, “All my colleagues are very humble and very curious about things. Whenever we work together, it’s not about who’s the smartest in the room; it’s about how we can solve technical problems all together, and also how we can learn together while maintaining a very high quality of engineering for the organization.”</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/esxrdctfvygbh-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/esxrdctfvygbh-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/esxrdctfvygbh-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-429837" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/esxrdctfvygbh-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">7. Having curiosity.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Given the nature of engineering and evolving demands for cybersecurity, being curious about the field and process is vital. Senior SRE Bernard Ting explained: “SRE is what happens after you create the application. How do you get it into the hands of your customers? How do you make sure that it’s reliable? How do you make sure it’s secure? How do you make sure that you can roll things out quickly? All of those questions are what defines SRE, so those are the kind of things that I would encourage you to be curious about.”</p>
<p>Ting says that if you’re working on an application and are concerned it can fail in certain ways, “be curious and dig into it to see how you can improve it. What are other people doing out there? That will help you build up that technical expertise and also that mindset of always thinking what could go wrong and how could I make it better.”</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">8. Communicating effectively.</span></strong></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/10-surprises-of-remote-work-from-security-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote and hybrid work environments</a>, communicating across channels and while collaborating is especially important. “Having a more concise way of communicating can help prevent those 45-minute meetings from becoming hour-and-a-half meetings,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>In terms of coding, while it’s a necessary skill, “being able to explain your decisions and to look at something and question why it was done in that way and possibly find better options” is also essential, Fernandez said.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">9. Recognizing the impact you’ve had and the impact you want to have.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Being mission-driven is also important to hiring managers. One way they determine that is by looking for individuals who “understand what they’ve accomplished and how those translate into other things,” Rines said.</p>
<p>In interviews, Rines looks for “examples where they can translate what they did and the impact it made somewhere else, because that’s the type of person that’s going to be really jazzed to work on Duo because with how we focus on users, they’re going to see that impact, they’re going to know that impact, they’re going to be able to redirect their work to improve that impact and optimize that impact. That’s the type of person we want,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">10. Adeptly adapting to ambiguity and navigating change.</span></strong></h2>
<p>Given the changing nature of our world, having the capacity to adjust to change and accept ambiguity has become increasingly important. “The past couple years have shown us that having a tolerance for ambiguity is a good skill to develop. Folks who are adaptable and can figure out how to navigate change successfully is a really great skill,” said Vazquez.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #6abf4b;">A final piece of advice from a hiring manager?</span></strong></h2>
<p>“I think that the last one would be: Come <a href="http://duo.sc/security-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with us</a>,” said Dury.</p>
<p><a href="http://duo.sc/security-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zsexrdctfvygbhu-300x170.jpg 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zsexrdctfvygbhu-768x435.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zsexrdctfvygbhu-1024x580.jpg 1024w' sizes='(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-429838 size-large" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2023/03/zsexrdctfvygbhu-1024x580.jpg"   alt="" width="640" height="363" /></a></p>
