<p>Malware is one of the most common cyber security threats that organisations and individuals face. Whenever someone talks about their computer being infected, encountering bots or even falling victim to a scam email, malware is normally involved.</p>



<p>It’s why anti-malware software is usually considered a top priority for staying safe online. However, those tools are not flawless. For example, they can only spot known types of malware, and <a href="https://www.av-test.org/de/statistiken/malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the AV-Test Institute</a>, almost half a million new types of malware are detected each day.</p>



<p>But how exactly does malware work? In this blog, we explain everything you need to know about it, including our top 8 tips for preventing malware attacks.</p>



<center><hr></center>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>What is malware?</strong></h2>



<p>Malware, or malicious software, is a broad term that refers to any type of code that intends to harm a computer.</p>



<p>It can do this in a number of ways, such as:</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;">
<li>Stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive information;</li>



<li>Hijacking or altering core system functions;</li>



<li>Monitoring user activity; and</li>



<li>Spamming the device with adverts.</li>
</ul>



<center><hr></center>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Types of malware</strong></h2>



<p>There are many different types of malware, but there are <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/7-types-of-malware-you-need-to-look-out-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven types</a> that are extremely common:</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;">
<li><strong>Adware</strong> displays ads on your computer – typically in the form of popups and windows that can’t be closed.</li>



<li><strong>Spyware</strong> monitors Internet activity and gathers information, which can either be sold to a third party or used to target you with adware.</li>



<li><strong>Bots</strong> run automatic and often repetitive tasks over the Internet. This might not necessarily be for criminal purposes (think, for example, of Twitterbots, which tweet and follow other accounts), but bots can be used to harness multiple computers in a botnet and create a more powerful threat.</li>



<li><strong>Ransomware </strong>spreads through a target’s systems, encrypting files as it goes. The criminal behind the attack then demands a payment in exchange for the decryption key.</li>



<li><strong>Trojan horses</strong> are malicious programs that masquerades as something useful in an attempt to trick people into downloading it.</li>



<li><strong>Viruses</strong> copy themselves and spread, undetected, to other victims. It can do this by attaching itself to programs, script files, documents and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps.</li>



<li><strong>Worms</strong> are self-contained and self-propagating viruses. They usually show up via email and instant messages, and spread over networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<center><hr></center>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How is malware distributed?</strong></h2>



<p>Malware is delivered in one of several ways, but the most common method by far is <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/5-ways-to-detect-a-phishing-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phishing</a>. This is a type of fraud in which bogus messages appear as though they have come from a genuine source and encourage the user to follow a link or download an attachment.</p>



<p>For instance, an email might look as though it is from Amazon with an order confirmation for a product the individual hasn’t made. Or perhaps the email contains an invoice attached and is sent to an employee’s work address.</p>



<p>Whatever form the message takes, it’s almost always designed to create a sense of urgency and pressure the recipient into acting immediately.</p>



<p>If the email contains an attachment, there will be malware hidden within it – often contained in a macro on a Word file – which is unleashed as soon as the user opens the file or approves the macro.</p>



<p>By contrast, phishing emails that direct users to another website are typically designed to capture  login credentials, but the bogus website might also use another method of malware delivery: drive-by downloads.</p>



<p>Compromised websites can be laced with malware, which infect users&#8217; devices after they inadvertently click a pop-up window that gives the site permission to download an attachment. The windows usually mask as something genuine, such as an error message that looks as though it’s part of the computer’s operating system.</p>



<p>A subset of this is social network spam. Cyber criminals include bogus links on these platforms that direct visitors to a compromised website. For example, a video link might ask you to install a bogus video player plugin, which contains malware.</p>



<center><hr></center>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How to prevent malware attacks in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve explained, malware can attack you in many different ways, so there’s no one way to prevent infections. However, there are certain measures you can take to protect you from an array of threats.</p>



<p>Here are eight things you can do to get started:</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;">
<li><strong>Install antivirus and anti-malware software</strong>: These tools help protect your computer from viruses and other types of malicious software. Make sure to choose reputable software and keep it updated.</li>



<li><strong>Update software and operating systems</strong>: Keeping software and operating systems updated is important because updates often include security patches and bug fixes that help protect against vulnerabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Disable macro scripts in Microsoft Office files</strong>: Macro scripts can be used to execute malicious code, so it&#8217;s a good idea to disable them in Microsoft Office files unless you know that they are safe.</li>



<li><strong>Back up important data</strong>: Backing up important data is important in case of a data breach or other type of cyber attack. Make sure to keep backups in a secure location.</li>



<li><strong>Use a VPN</strong>: Using a VPN can help protect your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address.</li>



<li><strong>Provide staff awareness training</strong>: Educating employees about cyber security best practices is important to help prevent cyber attacks. Make sure to provide training and resources to help employees understand the risks and how to protect themselves.</li>



<li><strong>Implement access controls</strong>: These ensure that only authorised personnel can view sensitive information, and can protect data if an employee’s account it compromised.</li>



<li><strong>Use email filters</strong>: These can identify known malware hidden within emails and block those messages from employees’ inboxes.</li>
</ul>



<center><hr></center>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Covering the essentials</strong></h2>



<p>If you want more advice on preventing malware attacks, we recommend Cyber Essentials. It’s a UK government-backed scheme that outlines the basic measures that organisations can take to secure their systems.</p>



<p>It contains five controls, one of which focuses on malware protection, and when they’re implemented correctly they can prevent 80% of common cyber attacks.</p>



<p>IT Governance offers a <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/solutions-for-ces-certification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">range of solutions</a> to help you understand and implement the framework. We’re one of the founding Cyber Essentials certification bodies and remain one of the largest in the UK.</p>

<p>It’s almost time to wrap up your prized possessions and put them in a safe place, because this Friday marks World Backup Day.</p>



<p>The international event takes place on 31 March and aims to raise awareness of the importance of securing valuable data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the event’s organisers</a>, 21% of people have never made backups of important files, whether that’s family photos, business documents or work files.</p>



<p>It’s a baffling statistic, because digital media is ubiquitous in our everyday lives and there is always a chance of those files being compromised.</p>



<p>For instance, documents can be corrupted in a hardware failure or compromised in a cyber attack, they can be lost or tampered with, or the devices that they’re kept on can be damaged.</p>



<p>If you have only one copy of those files, they will be permanently lost. That’s a big risk given how easy it is to back up your files.</p>



<p>Understanding these risks should be a cornerstone of our education, because almost everyone these days keeps digital files as part of their job or personal life.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/steps-for-securing-business-data-begin-with-first-identifying-it/article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Databodi CTO Carl D’Halluin explains</a>: “Failing to backup your data can have catastrophic consequences, as a single hardware failure, cyberattack, or natural disaster can wipe out all your valuable information, leaving you with no way to recover it.</p>



<p>“This means that years of hard work can all be lost in an instant, with no chance of retrieval. Even the cost of losing just a portion of your important data can be immeasurable, with potential financial, legal, and reputational implications that can last for years.”</p>



<p>Given how important data backups are, you’d be forgiven for thinking that experts had detailed technical advice for securing your information. However, the process can be as simple or as complex as you like.</p>



<p>Individuals might be content to email copies of sensitive files to themselves, keeping them in a server controlled by their email provider. Meanwhile, organisations will probably have more robust measures that automate the process.</p>



<p>As part of its campaign, World Backup Day urges people to make the following pledge:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1015" height="192" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44653" srcset="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png 1015w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-300x57.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-768x145.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /></figure></div>


<div style="height:24px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Although that’s a great start, you need to get in the habit of backing up your data on a regular basis. Any time you create a new file or amend an existing one, you must ensure that the data is secured.</p>



<p>It’s therefore worth taking the time to figure out a system that suits your needs. The information you save should be stored in a secure location that enables you to find the documents you need easily.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Online vs offline backups</strong></h2>



<p>The most common solution for backups is to store your data in the Cloud. Apple iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive are common Cloud storage providers, which enable people to quickly save duplicates in an online server.</p>



<p>The process is often automatic, and it comes with the added benefit of allowing people to access data on one device that was created in another. This is handy if you have a photo saved on your phone that you want to display on your laptop, or if you want to share a file with someone else.</p>



<p>However, the benefits of the Cloud have seen it take on mythic status among its proponents. There is a mistaken belief that you can simply put whatever information you like into the Cloud and it’ll be safe forever.</p>



<p>But like any other Internet-connected system, the Cloud contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This means that servers can be rendered temporarily unavailable, or the data can viewed by unauthorised parties. Worse still, it could be permanently wiped.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the Cloud is an ideal way to conveniently secure your files, particularly if you need to regularly access or amend them.</p>



<p>However, if you have highly classified data or want to be certain that the information won’t be compromised, we recommend storing another set of backups offline.</p>



<p>For example, you might keep your data on a USB stick or a portable hard drive. This ensures that you have versions of the data that are protected from cyber criminals or third-party technical failure.</p>



<p>This isn’t a foolproof solution because these devices can also be damaged or lost, but there is a much lower risk of this happening.</p>

<p>Organisations are always looking for ways to improve their security practices, and one of the most effective ways to achieve this is by providing employees with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybersecurity-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyber security training</a>.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929005323/en/Lucy-Security-Study-Demonstrates-Cybersecurity-Awareness-Increases-IT-Security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lucy Security study</a> found that 96% of respondents agreed that a greater level of awareness over cyber security threats contributed to overall improvements in their defences.</p>



<p>Despite that, comparatively few provided adequate training to help staff mitigate the risks of data breaches and cyber attacks.</p>



<p>For example, only 81% of respondents said they conduct phishing simulations, and only 51% say their organisation has a mechanism to report suspicious emails.</p>



<p>There has never been a better time is there to boost your organisation’s knowledge of effective information security practices. Here are three reasons to consider it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>1. You’ll reduce the risk of data breaches</strong></h2>



<p>Almost all <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-breaches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data breaches</a> are caused by a mistake somewhere in the organisation. So if you want to keep your organisation secure, your employees to know what they’re doing.</p>



<p>That doesn’t only mean negligence – it could also be mistakes that you don’t even know are mistakes, such as gaps in your policies, ineffective processes or a lack of proper technological defences.</p>



<p>Placing staff on information security training courses will help them understand the mistakes they’re making and teach them to work more effectively.</p>



<p>This is especially useful if you intend to commit to a framework such as <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISO 27001</a>, the international standard for information security, as there are specific courses that teach you how to follow the Standard’s requirements.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>2. You’ll meet compliance requirements</strong></h2>



<p>Cyber security laws and regulations inevitably contain complex requirements, so organisations need employees with specialist knowledge to achieve compliance.</p>



<p>For example, organisations that are required to appoint a <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DPO (data protection officer)</a> under the <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a> must find someone with an in-depth understanding of data protection law.</p>



<p>The stakes associated with the position are huge; if the DPO doesn’t perform their tasks in accordance with the GDPR’s requirements, the organisation is liable to face <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulatory action</a>.</p>



<p>It’s therefore paramount that the DPO is given every resource available to do their job properly, and training courses should always be sought where possible.</p>



<p>They are not only the quickest way of studying but also usually include exams, which reassures employers that the individual is qualified.</p>



<p>The same advice applies for individuals in roles that involve compliance with the <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/pci_dss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</a>, ISO 27001 or any other law or framework.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>3. You’ll foster career growth</strong></h2>



<p>Training courses enable employees to pick up new skills and gain more advanced qualifications, which will help them move into more senior roles.</p>



<p>This isn’t only beneficial for them but also their employers. It’s getting increasingly hard to find qualified information security professionals, with <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-cyber-skills-shortage-rises" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">82% of UK-based organisations saying that there is a cyber security skills shortage</a>.</p>



<p>Finding qualified personnel isn’t the only problem. A small pool of skilled workers also means job candidates can command a higher salary and more benefits.</p>



<p>As such, organisations might not be able to afford qualified professionals even if they can find them.</p>



<p>They should therefore do whatever they can to support employees who want to go on training courses. Organisations will almost certainly benefit from the extra knowledge, and it eases the pressure of finding skilled personnel in the job market.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Which course is right for you?</strong></h2>



<p>Cyber security is a broad industry, so you need to decide which area suits you best. To help you make that choice, here are some of our most popular training courses:</p>

<p>Confidentiality, integrity and availability. These are the three components of the CIA triad, an information security model designed to protect sensitive information from data breaches.</p>



<p>The CIA triad is a widely accepted principle within the industry, and is used in <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISO 27001</a>, the international standard for information security management.</p>



<p>It’s also referenced in the <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a>, with Article 32 stating that organisations must “implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services”.</p>



<p>But what exactly do mean by confidentiality, integrity and availability, and how does they help protect organisations from security incidents?</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Components of the CIA triad</strong></h2>



<p>The first element of the CIA triad is <strong>confidentiality</strong>. This describes an organisation’s ability to keep sensitive information private and secure.</p>



<p>The goal is to prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing the data – whether that’s cyber criminals or employees who don’t have a legitimate reason to access the files. To protect the confidentiality of data, organisations need security measures that can identify unauthorised personnel and keep them out.</p>



<p>The second element of the CIA triad is <strong>integrity</strong>. This refers to the completeness and accuracy of data, as well as the organisation’s ability to protect it from corruption.</p>



<p>Data integrity plays an essential and unique role in data protection. We often think of it in relation to who has (or doesn’t have) have access to information. However, it’s just as important to consider whether the information itself is correct.</p>



<p>If there are mistakes within the data, organisations might accidentally share classified information with the wrong person. There is also the possibility that the information won’t be delivered at all.</p>



<p>The third element of the CIA triad is <strong>availability</strong>. This refers to an organisation’s ability to access information when needed. This might be the case, for example, if a power cut knocks out an organisation’s servers or if a Cloud hosting provider’s systems are disrupted.</p>



<p>Although data availability often refers to these sorts of organisation-wide issues, it can also apply to individual circumstances. For instance, an employee might have a technical problem that prevents them viewing a sensitive file, or they don’t have keys to a filing cabinet.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Examples of the CIA triad</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<h4 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidentiality</strong></h4>



<p>Data confidentiality is most likely to apply in relation to personal data, such as customers’ names, contact details and payment card information. These details should be stored in relevant databases and made accessible only to those who need it.</p>



<p>This might mean password-protecting files or setting up access controls. You should also consider storing different pieces of information in the separate databases.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t, for instance, keep the customer account details, such as their username and password, in the same files as their other personal data. You should also silo highly sensitive data, such as credit card information and health records.</p>



<p>Confidentiality doesn’t only refer to personal data, though. It encompasses any information of a sensitive nature. This might include things such as intellectual property and corporate records. These too must be given adequate protection to ensure that only authorised personnel can gain access.</p>



<h4 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>            Integrity</strong></h4>



<p>An example of data integrity would occur in relation to a healthcare firm mailing a patient information about their medical condition.</p>



<p>The organisation must be certain that their records are correct, otherwise the recipient will receive incorrect information about their health status, or they might not receive an update at all. Meanwhile, the person who inadvertently received the communication will be privy to a third party’s health condition.</p>



<p>Data integrity can also refer to corporate data. For example, an organisation must ensure that the price of products on their e-commerce site are listed correctly. If they inadvertently undercharge someone for an item, they are obliged to fulfil their order, which will have financial ramifications for your business.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform: none;"><strong>            Availability</strong></h4>



<p>An organisation’s systems, applications and data must be accessible to authorised users on demand. If, for example, the organisation suffers a power outage that knocks their systems offline, their operations will grind to a halt.</p>



<p>Likewise, if cyber criminals encrypt the organisation’s files in a ransomware attack, they will face major disruption.</p>



<p>Availability can also apply to a specific employee’s ability to view information. If there is a problem with their account or hardware, they might not be able to access information necessary to perform their job.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Why is the CIA triad important?</strong></h2>



<p>Each aspect of the CIA triad represents the foundational principles of information security. Between them, they cover every possible way that sensitive data can be compromised.</p>



<p>But the triad is about more than the individual aspects of data protection; the three components work together to become more than the sum of their parts.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44472" width="267" height="224" srcset="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2.png 719w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2-300x252.png 300w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-2-70x60.png 70w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/01/16/drive-compliance-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There is a reason that confidentiality, integrity and availability are thought of in a triangular pattern.</p>



<p>Each element connects with the others, and when you implement measures to ensure the protection of one, you must consider the ramifications it has elsewhere.</p>



<p>For example, say an organisation implements multifactor authentication on a piece of third-party software.</p>



<p>Doing so protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, making it harder for unauthorised actors to compromise an employee’s login credentials and view information on their account.</p>



<p>But doing so hampers the availability of data, because employees now need to complete an authentication process to access the software.</p>



<p>Without the means to complete the authentication process – whether it’s a hardware token, an app on one’s phone or a functional biometric scanner – employees cannot continue.</p>



<p>Considering the three principles together within the framework of a triad helps organisations understand their needs and requirements when developing information security controls.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Implementing the CIA triad</strong></h2>



<p>The CIA triad runs through the heart of information security best practice. If you’re implementing the requirements of ISO 27001, the GDPR or any other framework, you are bound to run into the concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p>



<p>One thing that these frameworks have in common is the emphasis they place on risk assessments. ISO 27001 and the GDPR in particular mandate that organisations analyse their operations to measures the risks, threats and vulnerabilities in their systems that could compromise sensitive information.</p>



<p>By implementing controls to address these risks, you will satisfy one or more of the CIA triad’s core principles.</p>



<p>You can find out more about this process by reading <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-paper/risk-assessment-and-iso-27001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Risk Assessment and  ISO 27001.</a> This free green paper explains how you can complete the risk assessment process in line with best-practice advice.</p>



<p>You’ll learn how to determine the optimum risk scale so that you can determine the impact and likelihood of risks, how to systematically identify, evaluate and analyse risks and how to create a baseline security criteria.</p>

<p>Cyber incident investigation is one of the most crucial skills that an organisation can master.</p>



<p>With countless information security threats looming over your business, you need to understand that data breaches are inevitable. When you come to this realisation, you can implement an incident response plan that helps you identify and investigate security threats.</p>



<p>This ensures that you can respond promptly when disaster strikes, mitigating the damage, and saving your organisation time and money.</p>



<p>But how exactly should you investigate a cyber incident? We explain everything you need to know in this blog, outlining five steps to guide you from disaster to recovery.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>1. Identification</strong></h2>



<p>Speed is of the essence when it comes to incident response. The faster you can identify a breach, the sooner you can kick a malicious actor off your systems and begin the recovery process.</p>



<p>There are many ways that an incident might be identified. You might, for example, have automated threat detection tools that issue an alert when it spots malicious activity. Alternatively, someone on your team might spot something suspicious and alert the IT team.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>2. Initial investigation</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve identified a potential data breach, you should conduct a preliminary investigation. The goal is to identify all systems and services that have been affected, which will help you understand the scope of the damage.</p>



<p>You should also document what sensitive information, if any, has been compromised. It’s best to err on the side of caution here; you might not know definitively what data a malicious actor accessed, but you will know what they could have viewed given the nature of their intrusion.</p>



<p>For example, if a single corporate account was compromised, the attacker would have access to anything that employee viewed. By contrast, if they launched a ransomware attack, they could conceivably have exfiltrated every piece of sensitive information on the network.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>3. Immediate action</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you know exactly what’s happened, you must take urgent steps to isolate the affected areas of your business. You can think of this part of the investigation like police cordoning off the scene of the crime.</p>



<p>The goal is to prevent any contamination of the evidence and to gather any relevant information about what has happened. You should interview the people who discovered the breach to find out what they know, and gather any evidence that’s immediately available.</p>



<p>Where relevant, you must also notify law enforcement and regulators about the data breach.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>4. Analyse the data</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve gathered the relevant information about the cyber incident, you must analyse it. The goal is to gain a more complete understanding of how the data breach occurred and what information or systems were compromised.</p>



<p>You should discover, for example, whether it was caused be an internal actor or a criminal hacker. You might also discover whether a malicious actor had privileged access to data and for how long the information was compromised.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>5. Remediation planning</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you have a clear understanding of what happened and – more importantly – how, you can draw conclusions about the incident and look for ways to resolve the data breach.</p>



<p>The specific actions you take here will depend on the nature of the incident. You must therefore have a comprehensive plan that outlines remediation efforts related to all relevant information security risks.</p>



<p>The documented plan should include estimates for how long remediation tasks will take, the level of priority each one is given and the person responsible for overseeing the task.<strong></strong></p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>What next?</strong></h2>



<p>With the investigation complete, it’s time to contain the threat and get back to business as usual. As part of this process, security specialists should carefully monitor the network and recovered systems to ensure that the threat has been fully addressed.</p>



<p>We understand at IT Governance that you might not have the internal expertise to manage this process with confidence.</p>

<p>Cyber attacks are like earthquakes. There is the immediate shockwave when an incident occurs, as you hurry to identify the source of the breach, plug the vulnerability and fulfil your immediate regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>Then come the secondary waves that produce new problems. For example, how have essential operations been affected, and what are you doing to protect and restore your reputation?</p>



<p>Organisations often overlook the damage that these lingering problems cause, and the consequences can be far more expensive than they bargained for. According to one report, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organisations could spend £3.6 million or more</a> recovering from a security incident – and without appropriate processes in place, that figure could be much higher.</p>



<p>It’s why experts recommend a layered approach to cyber security that accounts for the steps organisations must take after an incident has occurred in addition to measures designed to prevent breaches.</p>



<p>The framework is known as <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cyber-defence-in-depth?promo_name=homepage&amp;promo_id=carousel-1-did" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defence in depth</a>, and it contains five interrelated stages. Even if one of these defensive layers is breached, the next works to further contain the damage.</p>



<p>In this blog, we look at how you can recover from cyber attacks by taking a defence-in-depth approach to information security.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>What is threat recovery?</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/05-Recovery-Sheild_Green-and-Grey.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44232" width="170" height="170" srcset="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/05-Recovery-Sheild_Green-and-Grey.png 200w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/05-Recovery-Sheild_Green-and-Grey-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/05-Recovery-Sheild_Green-and-Grey-65x65.png 65w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></figure></div>


<p>When all other lines of defence fail, you need to ensure your organisation can survive.</p>



<p>Often, you will be able to restore enough critical services to be able to continue functioning, but it can take months to fully return to business as usual. In the meantime, you need a plan for how you will manage, plus you need appropriate resources to implement those plans.</p>



<p>For a start, you need <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/bc_dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business continuity and disaster recovery plans</a>. Business continuity is about ensuring that your organisation continues to operate in the event of disruption. It’s a way of temporarily addressing a problem until you’re able to address the underlying issue.</p>



<p>For example, say your office is flooded. A business continuity plan would outline how to&nbsp;secure&nbsp;your important&nbsp;assets&nbsp;and how to ensure staff can continue to work.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, disaster recovery is the process of resolving the disruption. At its most basic level, it involves identifying the source of the incident and finding a way to fix it.</p>



<p>The plans are usually very technical and focus on specific deadlines that must be met to prevent catastrophic damage.&nbsp;It will include things such as RTOs (recovery time objectives), which&nbsp;are&nbsp;estimates&nbsp;of how long it will take for a product, service or activity to become available following an incident.</p>



<p>Comprehensive documentation ensures that the organisation is prepared for whatever happens, but implementing these plans can be expensive. This is where cyber insurance helps.</p>



<p>Policies provide organisations with the means to implement incident response measures, such as forensic investigation, legal assistance and public relations support.</p>



<p>These activities aren’t typically included in standard business insurance policies, which usually only cover costs related to technical issues, such as corrupted hard drives and lost devices.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How we can help</strong></h2>



<p>Whatever your resources or expertise, a defence-in-depth approach to cyber security will give you the best chance of mitigating the cyber security risks your organisation faces, so you can focus on your core business objectives without having to worry about coming under attack.</p>

<p>The framework consists of five interrelated stages (or ‘layers’) to mitigate the risk of data breaches: detection, protection, management, response and recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if one of these defensive layers is breached, the next works to further contain the damage.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>What is threat detection?</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="200" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44107" srcset="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4.png 200w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-65x65.png 65w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure></div>


<p>Understanding the threats you face and where your organisation is most at risk of being breached is critical to information security. It’s only by knowing the specific risks you face that you can implement appropriate defences. </p>



<p>Threat detection works by analysing your organisation’s systems, networks and practices to identify vulnerabilities that could result in data breaches.</p>



<p>There are, broadly speaking, two types of threats: technical and human.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses in an organisation’s networks, software and third-party services that enable cyber criminals to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information.</p>



<p>Although IT teams are adept at spotting anomalies in these systems, new vulnerabilities are discovered every day. It’s therefore essential that you perform regular tests to identify and address weaknesses.</p>



<p>There are two tests that organisations should conduct. The first is <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/vulnerability-scanning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulnerability scanning</a> – automated probes that identify security vulnerabilities in computers, internal and external networks, and communications equipment.</p>



<p>The process spots open ports and detects common services running on those ports. It then highlights configuration issues or other vulnerabilities on those services, and assesses whether best practice is being followed.</p>



<p>The other way to look for technical vulnerabilities is with <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/penetration-testing-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penetration tests</a>. Unlike vulnerability scans, these are performed manually by professional testers, sometimes known as ethical hackers.</p>



<p>Assessments replicate the methods used by criminal hackers, giving organisations a real-world insight into the way a malicious actor might target their systems. The techniques testers use depend on the type of assessment, but they typically search for inadequate or improper configuration, hardware or software flaws, and/or operational weaknesses in processes or technical countermeasures.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Human error relates to the mistakes that employees make that could expose sensitive data. One of the most common weaknesses is people’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks, such as phishing.</p>



<p>In these scams, cyber criminals attempt to manipulate people into performing actions that are against their own best interests. Phishing attacks do this primarily with emails, although attacks can also occur on social media and by text message.</p>



<p>The messages replicate a real organisation and urge the recipient to follow a link and hand over their login details or download an infected attachment.</p>



<p>Phishing is popular among cyber criminals because attacks are quick and easy to conduct and have a comparatively high success rate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/resources/threat-reports/state-of-phish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proofpoint’s 2022 State of the Phish Report</a> found that 83% of organisations fell victim to a phishing attack last year. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verizon’s 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>&nbsp;discovered that a quarter of all data breaches involved phishing.</p>



<p>Although organisations can use tools such as anti-malware software to protect against phishing attacks, their most effective defence is staff awareness training.</p>



<p>No matter how well prepared you are for a data breach, cyber criminals will always find ways to circumvent security controls. When that happens, your employees are your last line of defence.</p>



<p>To prevent staff falling victim to scams, you must teach them <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/5-ways-to-detect-a-phishing-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to recognise a phishing email</a>, as well as what to do if they are duped.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How we can help</strong></h2>



<p>Whatever your resources or expertise, a defence-in-depth approach to cyber security will give you the best chance of mitigating the cyber security risks your organisation faces, so you can focus on your core business objectives without having to worry about coming under attack.</p>

<p>Organisations that suffer security incidents are sometimes said to be victims of “cyber extortion”, but it’s often unclear what exactly that phrase means.</p>



<p>Most of us understand what cyber attacks and online scams are, and many people are familiar with ransomware, which is a type of cyber attack in which people are blackmailed into handing over money. But how does this differ from extortion?</p>



<p>Put simply, cyber extortion is an umbrella term for a variety of cyber crimes. It can be used whenever criminal hackers force victims to do something after compromising their systems.</p>



<p>Ransomware is a type of cyber extortion, but there are in fact many techniques that crooks can use.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Why is cyber extortion so popular?</strong></h2>



<p>According to one report, <a href="https://go.corero.com/hubfs/3.%20Website%20Content/1.%20Asset%20Downloads/5.%20Infographics/Impact-DDoS-On-Enterprise-Infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">71% of organisations have been victim of cyber extortion</a>, making it one of the most popular weapons in fraudsters’ arsenal.</p>



<p>It is also a surprisingly new technique. Until recently, criminal hackers had only a couple of ways of making money from their criminal ventures.</p>



<p>The simplest technique was to sell the information on the dark web to other cyber criminals. With individuals’ details on sale for as little as £10, this is a consistent but inefficient way of profiting from criminal activity.</p>



<p>The alternative was to use the stolen information directly for fraudulent purposes. For example, if a criminal hacker stole payment card data, they could make bogus payments on victims’ cards for goods or services.</p>



<p>If the attacker didn’t capture these details, they could use people’s names and contact details to send scam emails. These would be designed to steal login access to personal accounts, which they could use for fraudulent purposes. Alternatively, they could sell access to the account to other criminals on the dark web.</p>



<p>These are all reliable ways to make money from cyber crime, but they are also time-consuming and often rely on a supply chain of other fraudsters.</p>



<p>Then came the rise in ransomware. The malicious software encrypts victims’ systems and forces them to pay money in return for the safe return of the data.</p>



<p>With this technique, cyber criminals could receive payment directly for compromising systems rather than having to sell or use the stolen information. Enough organisations have been willing to negotiate with criminal hackers that extortion has become the main option for many criminal hacking groups.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Examples of cyber extortion</strong></h2>



<p>The most common type of cyber extortion is ransomware – to the extent that the terms are often used interchangeably.</p>



<p>Ransomware is a type of cyber attack in which criminal hackers plant malicious code on the victim’s systems, which cripples services and encrypts files. The attackers then demand a payment – typically paid in bitcoin – for a decryption key.</p>



<p>Organisations that fall victim to ransomware are often reluctant to state specifically that they were infected by the malware. This has given rise to the popularity of the term ‘cyber extortion’.</p>



<p>The term is probably preferred by victims because of the connotations associated with malware infection, which implies (correctly or not) that the victim had weak security protocols.</p>



<p>By contrast, the term ‘cyber extortion’ places the blame purely on the criminal hacker, with the victim portrayed as a victim of blackmail.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are other types of cyber extortion that don’t involve ransomware. Indeed, the concept of blackmailing organisations has become so popular that cyber criminals often employ it with traditional cyber attacks.</p>



<p>It’s particularly common when the intrusion relates to sensitive personal information. In one instance, <a href="https://yle.fi/news/3-11608960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Finnish healthcare provider Vastaamo was hacked</a>, with the extorters demanding 40 bitcoins (about £400,000 at the time) or else it would release the health data of 40,000 patients.</p>



<p>The information included patients’ full names, home addresses, social security numbers and therapists’ and doctors’ notes from each session.</p>



<p>Despite this, Vestaamo refused to negotiate, and the hackers then blackmailed the patients individually, although it’s unclear how many people, if any, paid up.</p>

</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Another example of cyber extortion is ‘sextortion’ scams, in which criminal hackers target individuals, claiming to have footage of the victim watching or performing (often inappropriate) sexual acts. They then demand money not to release the evidence.</p>



<p>Although victims usually know that they have done nothing wrong, the scam works for the same reason that traditional phishing attacks do – people often panic under pressure. Victims of sextortion scams often assume that something could be taken out of context or the scammer could fabricate evidence.</p>



<p>The most notable example of sextortion targeted Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon and the <em>Washington Post</em>. It was allegedly perpetrated not by a cyber criminal gang but rival publication the <em>National Enquirer</em>.</p>



<p>In 2019, the <em>Washington Post </em>launched an investigation into the <em>National Enquirer</em>’s parent company after it published detailed about Bezos’ affair with Lauren Sanchez. Bezos later received a message threatening to release nude photographs of him unless he stated that the investigation revealed no evidence that the <em>National Enquirer</em>’s reporting was not politically motivated.</p>



<p>Bezos refused to comply with the request and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jeff-bezos-enquirer-791863/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted the threat online</a>. The nude photographs never materialised, indicating that, like many sextortion scams, it was an empty threat and the blackmailer had no compromising material.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Who is most vulnerable to cyber extortion?</strong></h2>



<p>Cyber extortion affects organisations of all sizes and across all sectors. There is only one thing that crooks consider when looking for a victim: how likely it is that they will pay up.</p>



<p>One factor that influences that is the cash reserves that an organisation has at its disposal. Large organisations have a higher revenue and will see a standard extortion sum – <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/2022/7/27/fewer-ransomware-victims-pay-as-medium-ransom-falls-in-q2-2022#:~:text=Average%20and%20Median%20Ransom%20Payment%20in%20Q2%202022&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,51%25%20decrease%20from%20Q1%202022." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically in the region of £30,000</a> – as a less significant loss than a small organisation with a lower revenue.</p>



<p>Although smaller organisations are often targeted (because criminals work by exploiting weaknesses wherever they can be found rather than seeking out specific targets), crooks always prefer those who can pay up promptly.</p>



<p>However, revenue isn’t the only factor that influences the likelihood of an organisation agreeing to a cyber criminal’s demands. With some types of cyber extortion, such as ransomware, the attack cripples the victim’s systems and severely affects their ability to operate.</p>



<p>In some cases, there will be growing pressure to get systems back online to prevent catastrophe. It’s why healthcare facilities are among the most frequently targeted by ransomware.</p>



<p>Criminal hackers know that ongoing disruption could cost lives, so many healthcare firms feel compelled to pay up. For the same reason, the education sector and public services are often targeted.</p>



<p>If schools close, children will miss classes and fall behind – plus, if the school shutters, students will be forced to stay at home and will need someone to look after them.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, disruptions to public services could affect the welfare of citizens, causing a backlash. Given that council members are publicly elected, decision makers will want to avoid disruption that could be held against them, and might be tempted to pay up and hope that their actions aren’t revealed.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How can cyber extortion be prevented?</strong></h2>



<p>The unfortunate reality is that it’s impossible to prevent cyber extortion attempts. In an increasingly digital world, organisations face too many vulnerabilities to remove them all, so there will always be the threat of cyber crime.</p>



<p>It’s why the figures for data breaches continue to soar each year, with IT Governance identifying more than <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2021-5-1-billion-breached-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,200 publicly disclosed incidents in 2021</a>.</p>



<p>There are, of course, measures you can implement to reduce the risk of falling victim. A robust information security management system is an essential start, while an assortment of technical defences – such as threat detection and data encryption – should be complemented with staff awareness training to help employees avoid costly mistakes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are steps you can take to protect you in the event that you are extorted. First, you should ask yourself whether there is a legitimate basis for the blackmail attempt. If the attacker claims to have footage or other compromising data, are you sure that this even exists?</p>



<p>Likewise, if you fall victim to ransomware, you should check whether your systems are in fact encrypted. With some attacks, it’s possible to decrypt your files without paying the criminals for a decryption key.</p>



<p>In other cases, the attacker uses a wiper, which deletes the files rather than encrypting them. Paying the ransom therefore won’t help, as the information is already gone.</p>



<p>When it comes to traditional ransomware, your best defence is to prepare for the inevitability of an attack. That means creating offline backups of your sensitive data and ensuring that they are updated regularly. The more important the information, and the more frequently it is used, the more often it should be backed up.</p>



<p>When backing up data, you must understand the difference between offline backup and what is often thought of when referring to backups, which are simply the automatic overwriting of saved files.</p>



<p>Although overwriting prevents progress being lost in the event that a system crashes, it won’t help with ransomware attacks, because anything stored on an Internet-connected device can be encrypted.</p>



<p>Offline backups involve a second set of sensitive information that is disconnected from the files on an individual computer or server. Doing so ensures that, even after your systems have been encrypted, you have safe versions of the data that you can use.</p>



<p>You are not forced to pay off the attackers in the hope that they will stick to their word. Instead, you can wipe your infected systems and rebuild them in a safe environment.</p>



<p>Another essential defence mechanism in the fight against cyber extortion is staff awareness training. Ransomware often makes its way onto organisations’ systems via phishing emails, with employees being tricked into downloading a malicious attachment.</p>



<p>By educating your staff on the threat of these attacks, you can greatly reduce the likelihood of falling victim.</p>

<p>Access control is often considered an essential component of information security, and for good reason. It’s one of the most basic steps that organisations can take to protect their sensitive data, and it’s also among the most versatile.</p>



<p>Restricting access to certain systems reduces the risk of several cyber security risks, and it also limits the possibility of malicious insiders wreaking havoc.</p>



<p>It’s why every organisation that stores sensitive information online must have access controls. But what exactly are they and how do they work? We explain everything you need to know in this blog.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How do access controls work?</strong></h2>



<p>In their most basic form, access controls determine who has approval to view data, and it restricts anyone else from accessing it.</p>



<p>It does this in a two-step process. First, there is an authentication mechanism that verifies the identity of a user making an access request. In most cases, this occurs when someone attempts to access information via their work computer, and so they will identify themselves using their account credentials.</p>



<p>The second part of the process is authorisation, which determines whether a user should be given access to data. Authorisation is pre-determined, with the organisation establishing who in the organisation is permitted to view various sensitive parts of the company.</p>



<p>For example, systems containing employees’ financial records should only be accessible by the organisation’s HR team, while access to highly confidential company information should be limited to the board of directors.</p>



<p>Other types of information will be more broadly accessible, with anyone in the organisation that provides correct authentication being authorised to view the information.</p>



<p>But to be effective, access controls require organisations to enforce robust policies. The system only works if the right level of clearance is given and if access to information is fully restricted.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Why are access controls important?</strong></h2>



<p>Access controls help mitigate the risk of two major security vulnerabilities. First, it prevents employees from accessing information that isn’t relevant to their job. This reduces the amount of information that any single employee can access, which in turn minimises the overall threat landscape.</p>



<p>It ensures that, should an account be compromised – such as a cyber attacker stealing login credentials – there is a limit on how much information the crook can access.</p>



<p>This it means that, for the majority of accounts, a compromise won’t expose highly sensitive information, such as corporate data or employees’ financial records.</p>



<p>Another benefit of access control is that it prevents employees from compromising information directly – whether maliciously or unintentionally. If a member of staff has free reign to look at any information they like, this could easily result in a privacy breach, whether the employee intended to use the information maliciously or not.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>Types of access control</strong></h2>



<p>There is no single way to implement access control. Depending on the organisation’s set up and its requirements, there are several methods that can be used:</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;"><li ><strong>Role-based access control</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is the most widely used form of access control, with individuals being given authorisation to view information based on their job role.</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;"><li ><strong>Mandatory access control</strong></li></ul>



<p>Users’ ability to view information is regulated by a central authority based on an information classification system.</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;"><li ><strong>Discretionary access control</strong></li></ul>



<p>This method enables administrators to set the policies that define who is authorised to access certain types of information.</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;"><li ><strong>Rule-based access control</strong></li></ul>



<p>In this system, the administrator defines the rules that govern access. These are usually based on conditions such as the location of the person making the access request and the time of day.</p>



<p>This version of access control is often implemented alongside a role-based system.</p>



<ul style="padding-top: 5px;"><li ><strong>Attribute-based access control</strong></li></ul>



<p>Privilege is determined by evaluating a set of rules, policies and relationships using the attributes of users, systems and environmental conditions.</p>



<h2 style="text-transform: none;"><strong>How to implement access control</strong></h2>



<p>You can find out how to implement access controls with the support of the <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cyber-essentials-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyber Essentials</a> scheme. It’s a UK government-backed programme that sets out five steps that organisations can take to achieve a baseline of cyber security. When implemented correctly, the steps can prevent 80% of common cyber attacks.</p>



<p>Among the five steps is access control, and to meet the scheme’s requirements you need a combination of policies and technical measures. As such, you must also ensure that you have a mechanism to authenticate users and assess their level of clearance before granting them access to applications or devices.</p>

<p>One of the most common mistakes that organisations make when addressing cyber security is that they consider it a one-off event.</p>



<p>Whether they’re taking small steps, such as installing antivirus software, or large ones, such as a <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a> compliance campaign, they consider it ‘job done’ when the implementation project is complete.</p>



<p>That’s a problem when cyber risks are constantly evolving, as is the way your organisation operates. Weaknesses will quickly appear as criminal hackers discover new techniques and you move to new processes that create additional vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>It’s why organisations must manage the risks they face with continual evaluation, maintenance and revision.</p>



<p>This process should be embedded within your overall cyber security measures in what experts refer to as <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cyber-defence-in-depth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyber defence in depth</a>.&nbsp;The framework consists of five interrelated stages (or ‘layers’) to help organisations manage information security risks across all parts of their business.</p>



<p>Even if one of these defensive layers is breached, the next works to further contain the damage.</p>



<p>We’ve been looking at each layer of cyber defence in depth in our blog, explaining what it encompasses, how it fits into an organisation’s overall approach to cyber security and the controls that you can implement to establish that layer.</p>



<p>Having previously covered the first two layers – <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/cyber-threat-detection-the-first-layer-of-defence-in-depth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threat detection</a> and <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-protect-your-organisation-from-a-cyber-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threat prevention</a> – we now turn our attention to stage three: threat management.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform: none;"><strong>What is threat management?</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="200" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44140" srcset="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image.png 200w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-150x150.png 150w, https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-65x65.png 65w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure></div>


<p>Managing cyber security risks requires a more intensive approach than simply implementing basic protections. Cyber security isn’t a destination – it is an ongoing process, requiring continual evaluation, maintenance and revision.</p>



<p>Threat management is defined by the way organisations address cyber security risks as part of their wider operations. It includes measures such as embedding risk-based security controls into corporate processes, managing supply chain security and carrying out regular audits to ensure security controls remain up to date.</p>



<p>Organisations can perform these tasks with the help of <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001">ISO 27001</a>. It’s the international standard for an ISMS (information security management system), and takes a risk-based approach to information security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Standard outlines three essential aspects, or ‘pillars’, of effective information security: people, processes and technology.</p>



<p>This three-pronged approach helps organisations protect themselves from highly organised attacks and common internal threats, such as accidental breaches and human error.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>ISO 27001 can also be used as a framework to help organisations achieve GDPR compliance. Many of their requirements overlap, particularly in relation to <a href="https://gdpr-text.com/read/article-32/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Article 32 of the Regulation</a>.</p>



<p>This section outlines requirements related to the technical and organisational measures that organisations must implement to protect personal data. It includes steps such as keeping records of processing activities, conducting data protection impact assessments where required, and training staff.</p>



<p>The GDPR doesn’t go into detail about what these processes should look like, because best practices – particularly when it comes to technology – change rapidly, and what is considered appropriate now might not be in a few years.</p>



<p>Fortunately, ISO 27001 contains a framework that’s updated every few years to provide the latest guidance on how best to protect sensitive information.</p>



<p>Organisations can use the Standard to, for instance, pseudonymise personal data. You can do this by replacing the names and unique identifiers of data subjects with a reference number, which you can cross-reference via a separate document.</p>



<p>ISO 27001 also provides guidance on measures such as anti-malware software, staff awareness training and vulnerability scanning.</p>



<p>Moreover, because organisations are required to continually audit to ISO 27001 to retain certification, it encourages them to manage their information security practices.</p>



<p>By regularly reviewing the effectiveness of any process, policy or technology that is implemented, you ensure that your defences are appropriate and that you remain compliant.</p>
