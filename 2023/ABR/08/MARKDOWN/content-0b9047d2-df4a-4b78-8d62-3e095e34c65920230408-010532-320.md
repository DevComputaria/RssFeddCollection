<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Nancy Zayed recognizes that there is a significant underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professions with a variety of factors contributing to this imbalance. But, as the cofounder and Chief Technology Officer of her own software payment security company, she chose not to be influenced by these facts and instead became an example of how women can achieve success in these industries. In this edition of our blog, Nancy discusses why we need to keep reminding ourselves that women have always affected this industry and that they actually lead innovation. She believes that knowing women’s role in the history of technology will propel their future. </p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Jane Goodayle believes that unconscious bias exists in every industry. Sometimes, even just the perception of the industry as “male dominated” can discourage women from participating. In this edition of our blog, Jane explains that women can push back against unconscious bias by continuing to bring our “A” game, expose unfair stereotyping, and challenge the ‘expected and accepted’ to prompt change. She believes that encouraging more woman into the industry will change its perception and inspire younger generations to choose a career in technology.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">Today, the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) published version 1.2 of the PCI Secure Software Standard and its supporting program documentation. The PCI Secure Software Standard is one of two standards that are part of the PCI Software Security Framework (SSF). The PCI Secure Software Standard and its security requirements help provide assurance that payment software is designed, developed, and maintained in a manner that protects payment transactions and data, minimizes vulnerabilities, and defends against attacks.&nbsp;<br></p>

Changes to PCI DSS v4.0 Reporting: In Place with Remediation

<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-align: left;">When PCI DSS v4.0 was released in March 2022, a new reporting option was included to document requirements that were “In Place with Remediation.” The goal of this option was to promote security as a continuous process, by providing a means for organizations to identify areas needing improvement year over year. While stakeholders agreed that this was a valuable tool for improving security, recent feedback indicates that there may be a better way to achieve this goal.<br></p>

</div> 
<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Kara Gunderson’s father always told her, “You have to arrange for your own good luck.” And this is a mantra that rings true for her. She believes that everyone, male or female, needs to work for their job. They need to roll up their sleeves, prove that they are willing to work hard, and that they are worthy of the position. In this edition of our blog, Kara explains that at one time she was one of the few women in petroleum payments and was held back because of her gender. But, over time, this has changed, and through hard work, she has arranged for her own good luck and success in the industry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) has published a new standard designed to support the evolution of mobile payment acceptance solutions. PCI Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC) builds on the existing PCI Software-based PIN Entry on COTS (SPoC) and PCI Contactless Payments on COTS (CPoC) Standards which individually address security requirements for solutions that enable merchants to accept cardholder PINs or contactless payments, using a smartphone or other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile device. The PCI MPoC Standard aims to provide increased flexibility not only in how payments are accepted, but in how COTS-based payment acceptance solutions can be developed, deployed, and maintained.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Stephanie Schiwinger believes that the key to attracting more women into technology professions is by having more female representation as role models. In her 22-year journey at Enterprise Holdings, Stephanie has seen strong female leadership styles that have inspired her to try to replicate for her own team. In this edition of our blog, Stephanie discusses why mentorship and authenticity are two important ingredients to navigating a career in technology.</p>

These new training courses are designed to bridge the knowledge gap between organizations and assessors by helping learners speak the same language as the Assessor.

At that time, like in many other professions, technology was perceived as more of a gender-specific role. In this edition of our blog, Jennifer explains how she pursued the career she loved despite the challenges, and why she believes more women will be encouraged to join the industry as they see other women simply leading by example.</p>
