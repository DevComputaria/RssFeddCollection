<p><strong>Kyiv, Ukraine</strong> – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently announced new sanctions against more than 650 individuals and legal entities that the government describes as “working for Russian aggression.” “None of those who help terrorists, work for them, supply or produce weapons for terror will escape responsibility” Zelensky said last week, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtD-F4k3Pg">video message</a>.</p>



<p>Dealing with saboteurs and collaborators – those who secretly helped Russia lay the groundwork for their invasion of Ukraine a year ago &#8211; is a task that the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) has been dealing with since the first day of the war, according to its new director, Ihor Klymenko.</p>



<p>Speaking in his first interview since being sworn into office, Klymenko told The Cipher Brief in February that saboteurs and collaborators working inside Ukraine have been sowing chaos since the war began.</p>



<p>“They tried to infiltrate the very heart of Kyiv as they were seeking to paralyze the work of the state authorities,” said Klymenko. “They were conducting all kinds of subversive activities.&nbsp; They were trying to sabotage the country’s critical infrastructure. They were trying to block and control the roads. And they were trying to gain a foothold in places where they could convey information to their forces.”</p>



<p>Within hours of the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion, officers from the MIA were working with the country’s Special Services units (SSU) to find and arrest those who had helped Moscow lay the groundwork for Russia’s invasion.</p>



<p>The spies, as Klymenko describes them, placed hidden cameras in strategic locations, were marking targets for Russian attack and created booby traps for the Ukrainians who would respond.&nbsp; All activities that significantly added to the early confusion in the opening days of the war.</p>



<p>When President Zelensky declared martial law, nighttime curfews were instituted as a means to make the work of the saboteurs harder.&nbsp; Checkpoints were set up around the capital and were manned initially by soldiers who were part of the national guard units and later, in some cases, were manned by people who had been just average citizens days earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Checkpoint guards interrogated drivers who were caught violating curfew, sometimes forcing them from their cars at gunpoint while they inspected their vehicles. &nbsp;Kyiv’s suburbs were instantly transformed to battlegrounds and the MIA, along with the military, were among the guardians charged with bringing order.</p>



<p>“We have worked with the Special Services hand-in-hand to ensure that all the subversive groups that have crossed the border and have entered the districts of the capital were neutralized. And I believe that we have done a miraculous job,” said Klymenko from his new office at the ministry headquarters, not far from the presidential palace.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Since the start of the war, MIA units have detained approximately 2,000 people on suspicion of cooperating with subversive groups.&nbsp; Today, the ministry is focusing on countering subversive activities along the frontlines, in the places that have seen some of the country’s worst fighting.</p>



<p>“We are trying to detect those saboteurs who are trying to mingle with and hide within the ranks of the civilians,” said Klymenko.</p>



<p>Since February 24, 2022, more than 100 units have been set up to find and deal with collaborators, with the help of residents who live in those areas. “Those settlements in the combat action areas have little population left, so it&#8217;s very easy to spot a stranger there,” he said.</p>



<p>And then there are the collaborators.</p>



<p>“Along with the SSU, we were in possession of information concerning the persons who were holding official positions in the temporarily occupied territories, thus collaborating with the occupiers,” Klymenko explains.&nbsp; And his ministry is acting on that information. “Collaborators are right now being detected and identified in the liberated territories. And some of those collaborators are being served with notices of charges in absentia, as they are currently residing in the temporarily occupied territories.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Police of Ukraine have initiated more than 2,450 criminal proceedings on charges of collaboration since the war began.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Klymenko didn’t take over as director of Ukraine’s Ministry Internal Affairs in the way he would have liked.  The one-time beat cop who rose to become head of the National Police of Ukraine, was sworn into office on February 7, after the MIA’s previous director, Denys Monastyrsky, his deputy Yevhen Yenin and 12 other people were killed in an accidental crash of an EC-225 Super Puma helicopter in Kyiv in January.</p>



<p>Within 20 days, Klymenko was officially leading an organization that had seen its workload increase by 70% since the Russian invasion a year earlier. It marked the beginning of the director’s new task of finding ways to master the chaos that had been inflicted upon a ministry traditionally charged with overseeing policing, security and emergency services.</p>



<p>Today, his organization is also tasked with documenting Russian war crimes, de-mining in some of the most dangerous parts of the country and forming new brigades.&nbsp; All are tasks that the 34-year police veteran never would have expected before the war.</p>



<p>He’s now overseeing the registering and controlling of weapons that were distributed to the population as Ukrainian citizens became soldiers overnight. And he’s leading his workforce through a transition from roles based on traditional law enforcement skills to the kinds of skills that will keep you alive on the battlefield.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, we are forming eight National Guard of Ukraine assault brigades, one National Police of Ukraine brigade, and one brigade that will fall under the commandment of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine,” says Klymenko.&nbsp; Though Ukraine still needs the weapons to arm them, military instructors to teach them, and the logistics required to sustain them, like heavier equipment and field hospitals, he noted. “We are still getting acquainted with our new obligations and new roles,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Klymenko pointed to a large cutout map made of wood that hangs on the wall in his office, pointing out the region of Kherson, where 30,000 police officers have been sent. “Dozens of National Guard Officers are now stationed there as well as rescue services and the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine,” he says.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re also mitigating the consequences of the missile and airborne attacks that are being carried out against our country and dealing with clearing the debris that is created by these attacks,” said Klymenko.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The MIA had no experience in documenting war crimes prior to the invasion but is now taking the lead role in collecting and reporting war crime-related information to international authorities. As of February, Klymenko said the MIA had documented more than 7,516 Ukrainian citizens who were killed as a result of Russia’s invasion, 461 of them children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are fully aware that the numbers are far from being consolidated as we understand that with the liberation of other territories, the numbers and the death tolls of victims will grow,” he said.&nbsp; “Since the start of the war, we have been exhuming the bodies of our civilians who are being buried in graves and identifying them. We are fully aware that even more of this work is awaiting us in the liberated territories.”</p>



<p>Klymenko says that as of February, MIA has documented the destruction of 152,000 homes, 3,200 educational institutions, 1,200 medical institutions and 7,500 pieces of critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>“Russia must be duly brought to justice for the atrocities committed in our country and we understand that the majority of crimes committed should be tried by international courts,” he said.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>SABOTEURS ARE USING MINES, TOO</strong></p>



<p>Saboteurs who are working in the areas around where the heaviest fighting is taking place – along Ukraine’s eastern and southern borders, are also using mines as weapons. Klymenko says a stunning 30% of the country has been mined and that Ukraine&#8217;s demining teams have collected nearly 500,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance.  The military is neutralizing the part of the explosives that cannot be used again and the other parts are being sent to the Armed Forces of Ukraine to “fight the enemy back” in Klymenko’s words.  Today, a lot of the demining activities are taking place near critical infrastructure sites.</p>



<p>“We are talking about the gas pipelines and the electrical grids that are now being restored,” said Klymenko. &nbsp;“The issue we’re facing right now, for example, is in the city of Kherson, where a lot of mines have been placed in administrative buildings or buildings housing critical infrastructure objects that are very difficult to be demined.”</p>



<p>Saboteurs in those areas are planting in walls or basements, so that when doors are opened, a large explosion is triggered.</p>



<p>“This has already happened on the premises of the main Department of National Police of Ukraine in the Kherson region as one of our EOD experts picked something up off the floor, setting off an explosion that blew up the entire building,” said Klymenko, who also says saboteurs are mining office equipment and furniture. “For example, they have planted mines into the seat of a chair and set a printer on top of it. So, when a person comes in and tries to pick up the printer, they set off an explosion.”</p>



<p>Ukraine is a country based on agriculture and as the weather gets warmer, Klymenko’s team will take on the task of demining vast amounts of the country’s agricultural fields. To date, Klymenko says Ukraine has demined some 90,000 hectares of land, soon to be followed by the demining of rivers and areas of the Black Sea.&nbsp; But he says his staff still needs vehicles that will allow them to quickly and safely demine those areas.</p>



<p><strong>THE FUTURE</strong></p>



<p>Klymenko says he is still working on feeling comfortable in his new role.&nbsp; He describes the entire ministry as still being in a state of shock over the loss of their leadership this past January.&nbsp; He says he’s thinking a lot about the future work ahead, including finding ways for citizens who have fled the country, to return and rebuild their lives while also trying to minimize the numbers of weapons that are now being distributed amongst the population. He’s also planning now, for the eventual reality that drug crimes are likely to take hold here once again, even though crime rates have been low since the war began.&nbsp; And he also worries about the men and women who didn’t ask for this war and who are paying a heavy price for it. “We are talking about the heavily wounded, people who have lost limbs, people who are now facing mental health issues. Those people require both mental and physical support.”</p>



<p>Klymenko says what he relies on most on his mission to bring order to the chaos, is having the right team around him. “I take no acquaintances. I take no friends.&nbsp; The only thing that matters is the professionalism and the expertise of those who have proven themselves since the start of the full-scale aggression. Those who have stayed in Kyiv, who have resided in Ukraine, and other parts of our country and who have fought back the enemy. Trust me, I place a great hope in those people,” he says.&nbsp; “Unfortunately, we have lost a lot of lives, yet we are doing our utmost in achieving victory.”</p>

<p>As Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday fulfills a historic&nbsp;meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the specter of strained Sino-U.S. relations is gripping security experts in a way that might not seem immediately obvious.</p>



<p>For context, when former U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi met with Tsai in Taipei last year, the visit spawned a series of war games. Chinese armed forces conducted live fire drills a mere 80 miles from the island, while Communist leadership – which has claimed Taiwan as its own since Nationalist armies fled there in 1949 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/-us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-meets-taiwans-president.html">decried</a>&nbsp;Pelosi&#8217;s visit as a “major political provocation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tensions ratcheted up, then cooled, only to surface again amid spy balloon fiascos, accusations of encirclement, trips to the Kremlin, and Tsai’s Wednesday meeting at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That meeting, by most accounts, is intended to shore up Taiwan’s most important ally and its commitment to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, something U.S. President Joe Biden explicitly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-us-forces-would-defend-taiwan-event-chinese-invasion-2022-09-18/">promised</a>&nbsp;during a 60 Minutes interview last year. As expected, Tsai&#8217;s trip drew sharp warnings from Beijing and promises of a robust, though unspecified, response. Scheduled to return to Taipei on Thursday, Tsai – who has said that “the best way to avoid war is to make ourselves stronger” – is facing a growing Chinese threat which U.S. Rear Adm. Michael Studeman&nbsp;<a href="https://news.usni.org/2023/01/16/china-undergoing-build-up-in-every-warfare-area-says-oni-commander">described</a>&nbsp;in January as a “build-up in every warfare area.”</p>



<p>Just last&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-military-taiwan-xi-jinping-14f9c3d8fef26779f017d927aa352eeb">month</a>, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for “more quickly elevating [China’s] armed forces to world-class standards,” a critical component of Beijing’s 2027 goals, which observers often identify as the date to which China intends to be militarily capable of taking Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet for all the saber rattling, historical thinking has often suggested that if a conflict over Taiwan took place, it would likely involve incursions using jets and missiles, coupled with cyber strikes in a devastating, albeit regionally restricted way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That sort of thinking seems to be ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Taiwan, the target&#8217;s not Taiwan only, it&#8217;s the United States and their intent is to keep us out of the war,” said General (Ret.) Keith Alexander, Cipher Brief Expert and former Director of the National Security Agency during last week&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/springsummit2023">Cyber Initiatives Group Spring Summit</a>.</p>



<p>Alexander, who also oversaw U.S. Cyber Command, discussed the prospect of a much wider conflict, including cyber strikes against U.S. command and control systems, defense suppliers, and critical infrastructure inside U.S. borders, should a conflict over Taiwan come to fruition &#8212; a notion that could bring the effects of war home in a way Americans have not experienced in a generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Chinese forces] would go after not only the defense industrial base, our logistics system, but also critical infrastructure, energy, and other things,” he said. “That&#8217;s something that they will constantly work to get better at.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-of-massive-chinese-cyberattacks-in-taiwan-scenario-/6981396.html">discussed the threat</a>&nbsp;at a Carnegie Mellon University event in Pittsburgh in February, saying that such attacks are &#8220;designed to incite chaos and panic across our country and deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the event that [China goes] after Taiwan,” she added, “they&#8217;re going to want to make sure that they affect the unity that has been forged between the U.S. and our international partners.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine rages, China seems to be taking note. The conflict has served as a kind of “proving ground” for a comparative conflict over Taiwan, experts say, allowing Chinese researchers to evaluate not only Western resolve, but also the relative successes and failures of hybrid warfare, which blends military strategy with a wide array of cyber-attacks. Disinformation campaigns, hypersonic missiles, as well as the use of Starlink satellites have all come into greater focus as of late, they add, as a result of the Ukraine conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the Chinese are learning from that [war],” added Gen.&nbsp;Alexander, who later warned during that same <a href="https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/springsummit2023">summit</a> that America has “a lot more infrastructure that is susceptible to these types of [cyber] attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet in some ways, the strikes are already happening. </p>



<p>In the past year, Mandiant announced that it had uncovered a bevy of state-sponsored hackers from China that covertly dug into U.S. government and business networks. Those tactics were later determined to be so secretive that Charles Carmakal, Mandiant’s chief technology officer, acknowledged that the scope of Chinese infiltration of U.S. targets is likely more expansive than is currently recognized.</p>



<p>His team, he added, has struggled to identify the full scope of those threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even with our hunting techniques, it’s hard for them to find it,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wave-of-stealthy-china-cyberattacks-hits-u-s-private-networks-google-says-2f98eaed">said</a>. U.S. intelligence officials’ annual threat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf">assessment</a>&nbsp;expanded upon those concerns, noting that China “represents the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. government and private-sector networks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that report, officials note that “if Beijing feared that a major conflict with the United States were imminent, it almost certainly would consider undertaking aggressive cyber operations against U.S. homeland critical infrastructure and military assets worldwide.” The report further described how the attacks would likely focus on “impeding U.S. decision making, inducing societal panic, and interfering with the deployment of U.S. forces,” while also attempting to “disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States, including against oil and gas pipelines, and rail systems.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet, summit security experts noted there may indeed be a silver-lining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as an attack against Taiwan would likely be preceded by cyber-strikes against U.S. mainland targets, a successful repelling of those strikes could also potentially prevent a broader war, effectively making Beijing think twice about continuing on toward Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It would be even better if [China] came at us and we knocked it down and said, ‘Don&#8217;t try that and don&#8217;t go after Taiwan,’” noted Gen. Alexander.</p>



<p>“We could stop the attack by winning the cyber phase.”</p>

<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> &#8212; Some thirty years ago, when I was a CIA Chief of Station in the war-torn Balkans, a US Special Operations soldier with whom I was working gave me a unique gift in honor of our time together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was an elite soldier from a family of elite soldiers.&nbsp; His stepfather served as a Green Beret in Vietnam while his father was one of the German GSG-9 commandos who freed an airliner from terrorists at Mogadishu airport in 1977.&nbsp; The gift &#8211; a bolt from a World War Two German MG-34 machine gun &#8211; came from the weapon his grandfather carried as a Fallschirmjaeger (‘paratrooper’) during Operation Eiche (‘Oak’), the 1943 raid that freed Benito Mussolini from his mountaintop prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>by Rajan Menon and Karol Kalush</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Rajan Menon</strong> is the Anne and Bernard Spitzer Professor of International Relations at the City College of New York/City University of New York, Senior Research Fellow at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace at Columbia University, and Director of the Grand Strategy Program at Defense Priorities. His books include <a href="https://amzn.to/3zrlMUp">Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post-Cold War Order.</a></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Karol Kalush</strong> (a pseudonym) is a former US intelligence officer with direct experience in Ukraine and its surrounding region.</em></p>



<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> &#8212; On the heels of Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia, the world seems to be waking up to the implications of China’s possible emergence as the peacemaker to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. As unlikely as this may seem, bear in mind that this war has confounded experts and pundits, shredding widely-held assumptions about both Ukraine and Russia.</p>



<p>The Chinese economic presence in Ukraine is already substantial through trade and major construction projects, and the PRC, while closely aligned with Moscow, has made sure to keep the channels of political communication with Kyiv open. China has reasons to mediate a settlement in Ukraine and to participate in its post-war economic reconstruction.</p>



<p>Ukrainian policymakers must continue to chart their relationship with the PRC, during and after the war.&nbsp; If the US wishes to counter China’s current and future influence in Ukraine, it ought to be remain active in assisting Ukraine’s economic revival and strengthening Ukrainians’ security. But the West should keep in mind that Ukraine’s leaders have amply-demonstrated strategic savvy, and a keen grasp of their country’s interests.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing that the war in Ukraine has taught us, or certainly should have, it’s the virtue of humility. Just about everything that’s happened since Russia’s February 24, 2022, invasion has confounded people who thought they knew a thing or two about these two countries—and about war more generally.</p>



<p>Three years ago, the proposition that Vladimir Putin would mount a full-on attack aimed at “regime change” against a country larger than France might have seemed outlandish, even though Russia’s war against Ukraine actually began in 2014, which means that it has been underway for nearly 3,300 days, not 365-plus.&nbsp; And once Russia’s invasion started, most everyone, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/05/russia-ukraine-putin-cia/">including the CIA&#8217;s analysts</a>, thought Ukraine’s resistance would crumble within days, so overwhelming was the magnitude of Russian superiority, which may explain <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/21/weapons-ukraine-russia-invasion-military/">the conclusion</a> of two RAND Corporation experts a month before the invasion that Western weaponry would be of scant help to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin also anticipated quick success because he overestimated Russia’s military prowess and underestimated the morale of the Ukrainian people.&nbsp; Put also underestimated Volodymyr Zelensky’s capacity to emerge as a war-time president who would rally them to defend their homeland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did Moscow and Washington both get it so wrong? This question needs to be addressed as part of a larger point that what now seems unlikely, could well happen in the relationship between China and Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>False Forecasts</strong></p>



<p>Contrary to expectations in both Washington and Moscow, a year after the invasion, Russia remains mired in Ukraine. Despite Putin’s September mobilization of 300,000 additional people for the fight, the widely-anticipated Russian offensive hasn’t amounted to much: the 600-mile front line has barely moved since November.&nbsp; Moreover, Russia has suffered heavy losses in soldiers and equipment—to the point that it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/23/russia-t54-t55-old-tanks/">now sending to the front T-54 tanks</a>, machines that date back to the latter half of the 1940s and is even running short of the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/russia-rationing-shells-ammunition-shortage-ukraine-1787597">artillery shells</a> that it has used to devastating effect. Then there’s the utter incompetence of the Russian military—something that took experts aback after the much-vaunted military modernization drive Putin launched in 2008.</p>



<p>Some will claim that the pre-war predictions went awry because there were too many variables to consider, for instance: Would Zelensky ask for a ride to a safe haven abroad—as other Ukrainians leaders from bygone years had done—or seek ammunition to stay home and lead the fight? Would Ukrainians who regard Russian as their primary language rise up to defend the homeland or welcome the “liberators”? Would Europe and the US confine themselves to condemning Russia or would they arm Ukraine for “as long as it takes”?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>But as long-time observers of Ukraine, we have a different explanation for why the commonplace expectations were wide of the mark. Many Western experts, and Russian officials, got things wrong for a variety of other reasons. These include a lack of deep, first-person, on-the-ground familiarity across the country with different segments of Ukrainian society; the assumption that Ukraine’s past would be a sure-fire guide to its future despite the unprecedented threat it faced to its very existence in February 2022; the acceptance of common stereotypes, including the old chestnut that Ukrainians who spoke Russian at home would support a Russian invasion; the belief that Russia’s agents in Ukraine would be successful in overthrowing the Kyiv government; and the failure to understand the extent to which corruption, outdated equipment and tactics, poor training, and lousy logistics had degraded the Russian army.</p>



<p>The bottom line: based on what we have all witnessed since Russia’s war on Ukraine, we ought to re-examine prevailing beliefs and come to terms with the fact that some of our basic assessments and expectations proved dead wrong—and that could be true of the standard views of China’s role in Ukraine.&nbsp; And as a result, we should also consider the implications for Western interests if China were to play a larger role in Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>The China-Russia “No-Limits” Friendship</strong></p>



<p>That’s the spirit in which we venture a scenario, which at first blush will strike readers as, at the very least, implausible: The possibility that China could broker a peace settlement in Ukraine, and one that Kyiv could find acceptable, and also play a major role in Ukraine’s post-war economy. Admittedly, this seems like a remote prospect now. After all, the “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396339708442914?journalCode=tsur20">strategic partnership</a>” between Beijing and Moscow that began in the 1990s—in other words, pre-Putin—has now become a “<a href="http://www.en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770">no limits</a>” partnership, as Xi Jinping and Putin called it in a statement they signed a little more than a fortnight before the latter unleashed his army on Ukraine.</p>



<p>But consider that since the war began, China’s <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Chinas-Imports-Of-Russian-Energy-Have-Surged-By-27-Billion-Since-Invasion.html">energy imports from Russia</a> have skyrocketed from $41 billion at the end of 2021 to $68 billion at the end of 2022. Total trade has soared from $141 billion to <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Chinas-Imports-Of-Russian-Energy-Have-Surged-By-27-Billion-Since-Invasion.html">$190 billion</a>, and Russia has looked to China for critical imports it can no longer get from the West. China has not only refused to apply sanctions against Russia, it has refused to support UN General Assembly resolutions condemning the war.</p>



<p>So, why on earth would China&nbsp; mediate a deal to end the war that’s acceptable to Kyiv, which, at minimum, would require Putin to withdraw his army to the pre-war lines? And why would Beijing strengthen its economic ties with Ukraine?</p>



<p>Answer: unadulterated self-interest.</p>



<p>Xi and Putin may use superlatives to describe their friendship—Xi calls the Russian leader his “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48537663">best friend</a>”—but countries aren’t completely, or even principally, guided by emotion. Their calculations are generally rooted in self-interest, and China is no exception. As the détente Beijing recently brokered between Iran and Saudi Arabia to much acclaim shows, China under Xi seeks to rival, and perhaps supplant, the United States’ global influence and eventually its standing as the world’s most powerful and influential country. &nbsp;Beijing backs Russia now not for sentimental reasons, or because of Xi’s fondness for Putin, but because China’s leaders doesn’t want the United States to be able to focus even more resources and attention on East Asia in general, and China in particular.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>Don’t miss The Cipher Brief reporting from Kyiv: As Ukraine announces a planned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/14119">counteroffensive</a>&nbsp;in the spring, the head of the country’s Main Intelligence Directorate, <a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-chief-predicts-how-war-will-end">Major General Kyrylo Budanov, is predicting</a> that the coming battles will be ‘decisive’.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>Beijing as Mediator?</strong></p>



<p>This bring us to Xi as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine. If Xi could serve as the prime mover for a political settlement that ends the war, Europe, now securely tied to the United States, would sit up and take notice, and China’s standing on the continent, indeed the world, would be boosted big time. A diplomatic settlement in Ukraine enabled by Chinese mediation would be interpreted by Europeans, and people worldwide, as confirmation that Pax-Americana is being slowly supplanted by Pax-Sinica. It would also mean that Chinese influence in Ukraine—a country of 41million with a land area larger than any country in Western or East-Central Europe and that is certain to eventually play a big role on the continent—would increase instead of being marginalized by the United States. And what a coup it would be for Beijing if it played kingmaker in Ukraine after the West devoted tens of billions of dollars to support Ukrainians’ resistance to Russia.</p>



<p><strong>But how could Beijing achieve so audacious an objective?</strong></p>



<p>For starters, no matter the rhetoric of an equal partnership, it’s pretty clear, certainly to China, that Moscow plays second fiddle to Beijing. Gone are the years when China looked to the Kremlin for direction and leadership. China’s economy has become the world’s second largest; Russia’s ranks <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/by-gdp">27<sup>th</sup></a>. &nbsp;Russia’s is largely a hydrocarbon economy; China’s has become a force to be reckoned with in everything from green energy and high-speed rail to AI. China used to be wholly reliant on Russian weapons; increasingly, it’s building top-flight armaments of its own. Both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/business/china-birth-rate.html">China</a> and Russia have demographic problems, but <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/04/russias-population-nightmare-is-going-to-get-even-worse">Russia’s population problem</a> looks far worse in the short term. Yes, Russia is selling even more energy to China since the war began (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/china-s-russian-energy-imports-balloon-to-88-billion-since-war?leadSource=uverify%20wall">$88 billion</a> in the 12 months after the war began compared to $57 billion during the same amount of time before it started), but given Western sanctions where else could Moscow look for a single big market now that Europe no longer plays that part?</p>



<p>In short, China has significant leverage over Russia, but the reverse isn’t necessarily true. Beijing could offer Russia all manner of benefits if it agrees to exit a war that’s manifestly failing. And without China’s backing, Russia would be much more vulnerable to Western pressure.</p>



<p>Xi would achieve another diplomatic coup by brokering peace in Ukraine, but why would Kyiv want him to play that role? &nbsp;For openers, China could muster the influence needed to nudge Russia toward a settlement that (potentially) the Ukrainians could accept as honorable and, in their eyes, worth the huge sacrifices they have made to defend their homeland.&nbsp; If the war drags on to 2024 (or beyond that) and Western support wanes, China’s bargaining chips could become more important for settle a conflict. The United States, for all its might, influence, and wealth, may prove unable to compel Russia to get out of Ukraine, short of direct military intervention, a step that no American president would take and that Biden ruled out from the outset. Washington may be able to ensure that Ukraine’s army has the weapons it needs to evict Russia, but that may take years more of warfare, which will burden Ukraine in numerous ways and possibly even lead to an economic collapse if international economic support is reduced. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>China in Ukraine’s Post-War Economy</strong></p>



<p>Ukraine needs a lot of money to finance its reconstruction. No one knows just how much, but one estimate, that of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-sees-post-war-reconstruction-costs-nearing-750-billion-pm-2022-10-24/">$750 billion,</a> and that was in October 2022. The World Bank’s latest estimate is <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/03/23/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment">$411 billion</a>. The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) pegs the cost at <a href="https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/during-the-year-of-the-full-scale-war-the-total-amount-of-damages-caused-russia-to-ukraine-s-infrastructure-has-reached-almost-143-8-billion/">over $140 billion</a>.&nbsp; But even if the price tag turns out to be only half of the KSE’s estimate, we’re still talking serious money. The United States and Europe will certainly help out, but neither wants to be stuck with the entire bill. Moreover, if Western economies face huge headwinds, which is possible given that <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/global-economy-disrupted-higher-inflation-slower-growth-2022.html">growth is already slowing and inflation accelerating</a>, Ukraine fatigue could set in and support for Kyiv could attenuate.</p>



<p>Enter China with its <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/foreign-exchange-reserves">$3 trillion</a> in foreign exchange. Ukraine will need all the help it can get to rebuild its economy, so massive has been the destruction Russia has wrought; and Beijing has the big bucks that could help. Plus, with the years of experience it has gained by now on account of construction projects worldwide (together with other investment they total <a href="https://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/">$2.27 trillion</a>—and that’s just since 2005), many related to its global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China also has the expertise. (BRI spending alone could surpass <a href="https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/belt-road-initiative/">$1 trillion</a> by 2027.) In addition, Chinese trade with Ukraine has been <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2022-02-24/chart-of-the-day-ukraines-trade-with-china-has-been-growing-101846549.html">growing substantially</a>, and by 2021 China had become Ukraine’s top trade partner, with the total value <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1297572/ukraine-trade-revenue-by-country/">twice</a> that of Ukraine’s trade with Russia, which was in third place behind Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2012 and 2021, China’s exports to Ukraine increased threefold and its imports by the same magnitude. A <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/whats-stake-chinas-economic-relationship-ukraine">recent report</a> by the Council on Foreign Relations notes that “by 2019, China replaced Russia as Ukraine’s largest trade partner, becoming the top importer of Ukrainian barley, while Ukraine overtook the United States as China’s largest corn supplier. Ukraine is also a major arms supplier for China, second only to Russia, and China is the largest buyer of Ukrainian arms.” <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/whats-stake-chinas-economic-relationship-ukraine">Chinese investments</a> in Ukraine encompass a range of projects, from the modernization Mikolaiv and Yuzhny ports to the building of a <a href="https://archive.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/ukrinform-kyiv-signs-agreement-china-construction-subway-line-troyeshchyna.html">new subway line</a> in Kyiv, which will extend from the Dnipro river’s east back to the center of Kyiv and is expected to <a href="https://www.globalconstructionreview.com/china-railway-completes-feasibility-study-kiev-met/">cost $2 billion</a>, based on the 2018 preliminary feasibility study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The economic ties between the two countries already has a substantial foundation and hence the potential for further growth, especially as Ukraine’s economic relationship with Russia diminishes. By helping to rebuild post-war Ukraine, which it is already doing during the war, China could establish a much bigger and enduring economic presence in a country that is rich in resources, is agricultural powerhouse, and has a vast pool of consumers, whose purchasing power will increase as reconstruction advances. Moreover, Ukraine’s location makes it a conduit for Chinese goods bound for Europe. As <a href="https://english.news.cn/europe/20220107/199a78fc8f414760b22610a597c80762/c.html">Olga Drobotyuk</a> of the Institute of Contemporary China Studies—based in Kyiv—notes, both Beijing and Kyiv are clearly aware of this. They have already cooperated on building a freight rail connection linking China and Ukraine and, during the last six years alone, signed agreements totaling nearly $3 billion covering an array of BRI projects. Describing the China to Europe rail line, the Chinese news agency <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0703/c90000-10118298.html">Xinhua noted</a> that during the first six months of 2021 “trains carried 720,000 twenty-foot equivalent containers.”</p>



<p>Then there’s the strategic dimension. As China acquires a growing stake in Ukraine, Russia will have to think twice—maybe three times—before invading again, which works to Kyiv’s advantage. As for China, Ukraine’s geography could give it a next-door-neighbor position in Europe, furthering its aim to compete with the US for influence on the continent by establishing a stronger foothold on the EU’s doorstep. Beijing no doubt realizes that the Silk Road rail line from China to Europe via Russia and Ukraine cannot continue to advance so long as Russia continues its war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>China’s <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/202302/t20230224_11030713.html">12-point peace plan</a>, unveiled on February 24, omits points central to Ukraine’s conception of the terms on which the war must end. Yet, tellingly, the very first point invokes the UN Charter and international law to emphasize the “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,” a formulation that Putin could have hardly wanted given that Russia’s invasion violates the Charter and international law. And the final point stresses the importance of “post-conflict reconstruction,” adding that “China stands ready to provide assistance and play a constructive role in this endeavor.” Though Xi’s declared intention to speak with President Volodymyr Zelensky following his March visit to Russia remains unfulfilled, it shows that China has at least entertained the thought of serving as mediator. And Zelensky, as witness his March 29 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-china-russia-xi-abcab63f7424cc15ef12d85aba180e7f">decision</a>, hard on the heels of Xi’s trip to Russia, to invite the Chinese president to Ukraine, is likely inclined to see what China has to offer on the diplomatic front and perhaps to shift its thinking in ways more favorable to Kyiv.</p>



<p>As the war drags on, and Beijing realizes that Russia cannot win (at least by Moscow definition of a “win”), and that backing a failing war does not serve China’s interests, the Chinese position may change and become more evenhanded.&nbsp; We cannot be certain this will happen, but the possibility should not be excluded given what China stands to gain, diplomatically and economically, by attempting to broker a settlement that ends the war—and perhaps succeeding.</p>



<p>What would China sacrifice to gain such multifaceted influence and prestige? Well, nothing really, because it’s not as if Russia can turn elsewhere, having burned many of its bridges to the West and won’t be able to rebuild them rapidly even after a peace settlement. Russia, too, seeks to shape Ukraine’s trajectory, but its invasion of Ukraine dashed that ambition, but China’s resources for influence-building in Ukraine are far greater. Beijing can preserve its influence in Russia, acquire a larger strategic and economic presence in Ukraine and the rest of Europe, and strengthen its standing as a global power. Its choice is not limited to backing Russia or abandoning it.</p>



<p><strong>Be Open to the Unexpected</strong></p>



<p>The war in Ukraine had produced many surprises, and that should serve as a warning against making confident forecasts or excluding potential moves on the chessboard. So, to be clear: We are not predicting that the scenario we sketch here is certain to materialize. One can think of several reasons why it wouldn’t. Nor do we claim that there aren’t possible downsides to the outcome we’re asking readers to consider, though we do believe that Kyiv will have the savvy to decide what benefits it and what does not when dealing with China in the near and long term. Besides, we do not envisage, let alone recommend, that Ukraine’s leaders align with Beijing, something they might have no intention of doing in any event. Our point is that there are sound economic and strategic reasons for Ukraine’s leaders to consider the role China can play in their country. Ukraine can craft a hardheaded relationship with China while simultaneously strengthening ties with Europe and the United States to pursue the larger goal of integration with the West. Kyiv does not face an “either/or” choice.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The growth of China-Ukraine political and economic ties will likely raise eyebrows, even create apprehension, in Washington, but American leaders ought to keep in mind another lesson that this war has offered, namely that Ukrainians are fully capable of deciding their future and have the strategic acumen to do so—wisely, without illusions, and with their own national interests squarely in mind. If the United States and its allies seek to limit China’s influence in post-war Ukraine they should, instead of merely warning Kyiv about the risks of building ties with Beijing, play a substantial role in its reconstruction, take steps to increase trade and private investment in that country, and increase its defense capabilities.</p>



<p>A war that has upended many conventional assumptions might end in ways we don’t expect. The same applies to current beliefs about what will happen in a post-war Ukraine and which countries will be the key players.

<p>The scale of Russia’s cyber-attacks in Ukraine swelled in the first quarter of 2023, a top Ukrainian official told a gathering of top cyber security experts at the <a href="https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/springsummit2023">Cyber Initiatives Group Spring Summit</a> on Wednesday; part of a new phase of the war to accompany an apparently stalled Russian ground campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Conventional warfare and cyber warfare are integrated things,” said Col. Ivan Kalabashkin, Acting Deputy Head of the Cybersecurity Department in the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), who detailed the nature of simultaneous Russian missile and cyber strikes against Ukrainian military positions and critical infrastructure, including recent strikes at a nuclear facility near Kyiv.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, Ukraine reported 4,500 such strikes and related incidents. That number is already at nearly 1,200 in just the first three months of 2023, Kalabashkin said. Ukraine is also dealing with around 1,000 Russian psychological and disinformation operations every month, he added.</p>



<p>Many of these propaganda campaigns now orient around the battle for Bakhmut, a small eastern city that has been a focal point of recent fighting. Russian forces have encircled the city but have been unable to force a Ukrainian withdraw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar addressed those operations on Wednesday, saying Russia is currently focused on three principal tasks in mass media: 1.) the undermining of civil-military trust, 2.) the discouraging of the Ukrainian army, and 3.) attempting to provoke battlefield mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our military command, not the Russian psychological operations, will determine how long Bakhmut will be defended,” Maliar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/russia-shifts-focus-bakhmut-issue-071417009.html">added</a>.</p>



<p>And yet as the battle for Bakhmut rages, broader security questions are also being raised, not just about the evolving nature of hybrid warfare, but also about the level of public and private sector preparedness in the U.S.  That preparedness includes evolving regulatory and law enforcement frameworks that govern and protect the comparably more digitally-connected societies in the West.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>“What I&#8217;m really worried about is that we believe that we&#8217;re safe,” said General (Ret.) <a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/general-keith-alexander">Keith Alexander</a>, Cipher Brief expert and former Director of the National Security Agency, during that same Cyber Initiatives summit. </p>



<p>“We’re not safe.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the U.S. in particular is thought to be especially vulnerable to foreign cyberattacks, according to an October&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2022/10/28/the-attack-on-americas-future-cyber-enabled-economic-warfare/">report</a>&nbsp;from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank. The group identified U.S. “blind spot(s)” for cyber-focused economic warfare that could provoke “a catastrophic strategic surprise – one that could simultaneously destabilize the U.S. electrical grid, water supply, banking system, transportation sector, or other critical infrastructure necessary for survival.” Hackers, for instance, who launched a cyber-attack in 2021 that disrupted fuel supplies throughout the U.S. Southeast, did so by stealing a single password. That breach occurred against a legacy virtual private network (VPN) that lacked multi-factor authentication, according to Senate testimony of Colonial Pipeline Chief Executive Joseph Blount. What that effectively means is a system that does not require a second stage in the login process, such as a text message, which is common among more modern networks.</p>



<p>“[Colonial Pipeline was] a wake up call,” said <a href="https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/principals-experts?pgid=l0auzspn-8c2fcf1f-9857-4c07-beca-9dc78f98afe6">Chris Krebs</a>, Cyber Initiatives Group Principal and former U.S. Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He reflected on the attack during Wednesday’s summit, which focused in part on establishing better &#8220;cyber hygiene,&#8221; a reference to the maintenance and integrity of online systems.&nbsp;Single-factor logins are generally thought to be comparably unhygienic. Resultantly, that relatively unsophisticated attack was able to create a days-long shutdown of Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S., prompting widespread gas shortages and consumer panic. A subsequent report prepared by the Energy and Homeland Security Departments determined that the country could only afford at most another five days of shutdown before mass transit systems would have to begin restricting operations as a result of fuel shortages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a phenomenon largely predicted by security experts, many of whom also noted that it could have been worse. In fact, it nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/oldsmar-florida-water-utility-hack/">was</a> that same year when a hacker tried to poison a Florida city&#8217;s water supply, increasing sodium hydroxide levels to dangerous levels. The hacker gained remote access to the Oldster water treatment system before luckily being thwarted by authorities before the water became toxic.&nbsp;Often wracked by budget cuts, as states and municipalities look to trim spending, water treatment and sewage plants are habitually considered among America&#8217;s most vulnerable critical infrastructure.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, particularly as U.S. political season approaches, security experts are also eyeing mounting cyber threats to elections systems. Such systems are generally comprised of a variety of components, including voting machines, tabulation equipment, and official websites that can be vulnerable to hackers. Despite progress in hardening these systems, “we face continuing threats from a growing number of foreign state sponsored threat actors, intent on targeting our election infrastructure and voters through cyber activity and malign foreign influence operations,” Kim Wyman, senior advisor for election security at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2023/03/cisa-election-security-still-under-threat-cyber-and-physical-level/384172/">said</a>&nbsp;on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Questions about disinformation campaigns, voter suppression, and even meddling with vote counts are coming to the forefront, she noted, alongside growing public-private sector recognition of long standing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The battlefields in Ukraine, it seems, could be just the beginning.   </p>

<p><strong>ANALYSIS/INTERVIEW</strong> &#8212; Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is U.S.-bound this week, with scheduled stopovers in New York and Los Angeles. The visit is an unofficial one, with formal diplomatic missions planned across a 10-day trip throughout Central America. But it comes at an important juncture, as rising tensions position Taiwan as a potential flash point in U.S.-China relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In what is perhaps the most controversial leg of the trip, U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69b627fc-ab7f-4b19-9ea3-5c308d81c6ef">plans</a> to meet with Tsai in California, with the Biden administration urging China not to use this visit as a pretext for a further degrading of relations. In fact, when asked about the upcoming U.S. visit of the Taiwanese president at a press conference last week in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbi responded with a correction: “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/chinese-official-snaps-reporter-no-180843162.html">replied</a>. “There is no such thing as &#8216;Taiwanese president.&#8217;&#8221;&nbsp;The last time a House Speaker publicly convened meetings with senior Taiwanese leadership, Beijing responded with war games near the island. When a German Cabinet Minister recently arrived in Taiwan in a bid to expand technological cooperation, Wang described it as “a pretext to interfere in China’s internal affairs.”</p>

## #cdata-section

<p><strong>Kyiv, Ukraine</strong> – As Ukraine announces a planned <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/14119">counteroffensive</a> in the Spring, the head of the country’s Main Intelligence Directorate, Major General Kyrylo Budanov, is predicting that the coming battles will be ‘decisive’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not the first prediction that the general, who has grown up professionally in the ranks of military intelligence, has made. He is one of the few members of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s inner circle who – just over a year ago – didn’t believe that Russia was simply ‘training’ the troops that were assembling along Ukraine’s border, as Moscow falsely claimed.&nbsp; Budanov was one of the few who warned President Zelensky that Russia was preparing to launch an invasion.</p>



<p>“I was relying only on facts,” he says, speaking from the heavily fortified headquarters he now calls both office and home, near Ukraine’s capital.&nbsp; “All the information that we had, all the available data, was pointing to an invasion.”</p>



<p>A year later, as the media speculated about a new Russian offensive that could give President Vladimir Putin a much-needed win to mark the anniversary of the invasion, Budanov dismissed the notion of a ‘mythical Russian offensive’.</p>



<p>“The so-called Russian offensive is already underway,” he told The Cipher Brief in mid-February, before some of the heavier recent fighting began.&nbsp; “It is taking place on the territory, mostly now, of Donetsk Oblast, and in principle, there is nothing new in it. It will go on as it is going on now.&nbsp;But this dramatically differs from what the media is saying. People are waiting for some mythical date when a thousand tanks will move forward, and 400 planes will advance at 4 a.m.&nbsp; It won’t happen that way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it seems like Budanov sees this war through a no-nonsense filter, it’s probably because he does.&nbsp; His headquarters, tucked deep inside a fortified island compound, is encircled by armed guards, concrete blocks and barbed wire fencing. In the lobby outside his office, armed guards greet visitors entering the dimly-lit reception room with an eye of suspicion. That could be in part, because of the many reported assassination attempts made against him, something the general brushes off.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve been through a certain number of them,” he says, “so it doesn&#8217;t surprise me at all. When people go to work like this, they should realize that this is basically an inherent part of their future life.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the day The Cipher Brief visited, Budanov’s assistant sat behind a large wooden desk near the door to the main office. Two men, dressed in suits and ties, looked uncomfortably out of place, shifting their weight from one foot to another, standing almost in the shadows.&nbsp; The only light in the room emanated from a large TV screen that was playing a Shrek movie with the volume turned down. “Who are the men in suits,” we asked our interpreter.&nbsp; “Probably here trying to sell him something,” he whispered back.</p>



<p>Ukraine is certainly in the market for military technology that can push this war toward a faster end by ensuring a Russian defeat.&nbsp; So far, aid from western countries has come at a slower pace than what is transpiring on the battlefield.&nbsp; It’s no secret that President Zelensky has used his charisma on the world stage in every forum imaginable to ask for more equipment, including tanks and F-16 fighter jets.&nbsp; Budanov says Kyiv also needs artillery systems because at the moment, there is a lack of artillery barrels.&nbsp; Attack helicopters would also be helpful, he tells us.</p>



<p>“Taking into account that we are preparing to take back territories that are being temporarily occupied, we need more capabilities for offensive actions,” he says.&nbsp; “Air defense allows us to provide cover for operations like this.”</p>



<p>Officials in Kyiv have also been asking for Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) that are capable of reaching deep into Crimea, where Iranian drones are routinely launched in support of the Russian invasion (drones that were detected circling the capital city on one of the nights The Cipher Brief was there).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we prepare to regain control of the temporarily uncontrolled territories, we need everything possible to conduct an offensive operation,” Budanov says.&nbsp; “We need air defense equipment to cover our troops as they advance and to cover important facilities in all other parts of Ukraine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Budanov also says that alliances with western intelligence agencies have proven extremely effective in this war, though he says sometimes, his troops need faster access to satellite imagery because of how quickly things are moving on the battlefront.</p>



<p>“Cooperation with the military intelligence community and with the United States of America, is of the highest priority for us,” he says.&nbsp; “This may come as a bit of a surprise, but we don&#8217;t just receive intelligence. They also receive data from us.&nbsp;This is actually a real alliance.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><em>It&#8217;s not just for the President anymore.</em></strong> <strong><em>Are you getting your daily national security briefing? Subscriber+Members have exclusive access to the </em></strong><a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/"><strong><em>Open Source Collection Daily Brief</em></strong></a><strong><em> that keeps you up to date on global events impacting national security.</em></strong> <strong><em>It pays to be a </em></strong><a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus"><strong><em>Subscriber+Member</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Budanov says that intelligence sharing and cooperation has only increased since the start of the war, particularly in the areas of early warning, offering him and his senior leaders a much more comprehensive picture of what’s happening in the air and space above Ukraine and parts of Russia.</p>



<p>“This is very important for us,” he says, “because let&#8217;s just say, from the moment the missile is prepared and launched, to its actual arrival at the target, a little time passes. Sometimes we see it, sometimes we don&#8217;t, and our partners help to complete this picture so that we have time to prepare and take necessary actions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Budanov spoke with The Cipher Brief from his office, where the windows were piled high with sandbags.&nbsp; They reach high enough to keep out most of the light, which seems to be a comfortable environment for the general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he talked about what his country needed to win this war, two frogs kept in a dark corner aquarium tried in vain to climb the slippery walls. &nbsp;When the war started, Budanov and his wife made the decision to move to the compound for the duration of the war and they brought the frogs with them because, as he explains, he couldn’t leave them behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across from his massive desk, another large screen hangs on the wall – this one filled with maps and what appear to be satellite images.&nbsp; And in another corner, stands a cage with two chirping birds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a live detector of poisonous substances,” he explains. “These birds are very susceptible.&nbsp; If they detect the slightest concentration of a poisonous substance, they will die immediately.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 37-years-old, Budanov is one of the country’s youngest and perhaps most eclectic, leaders.&nbsp; He seems to take pride in doing things the old-fashioned way. &nbsp;For example, most of the intelligence that crosses his desk comes on a piece of paper.</p>



<p>“We do this to avoid leaks,” he says. “Everything comes only in paper form.&nbsp;Paper reports can only be obtained, shall we say, if you physically get them, so this way, interception is nearly impossible.”</p>



<p>Some of the intelligence reports that the general has been focused on over the past year, have been about the make-up of Russia’s fighting force, with much of the intelligence coming from Russians troops captured on the battlefield.&nbsp; Budanov said recently captured Russian soldiers hailed from a Russian Marine Unit, the 155<sup>th</sup> Naval Infantry Brigade.&nbsp; The brigade reportedly suffered devastating losses over the course of a recent three-week offensive in Vuhledar, a mining town along the Ukrainian-Russian border that has been demolished by fierce fighting.&nbsp; Media reports described the Russian unit that was lost there as an ‘elite brigade,’ but Budanov says that’s not consistent with his intelligence.</p>



<p>“The vast majority of people who were taken prisoner during these hostilities are only conditionally, marines,” he says. “Ninety percent of them are crew members who were taken directly from the ships. These are engineers, mechanics, and the crew of conventional warships.&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the Russian Federation has very significant problems with manning and training, they lack, quite simply, people. So, they were simply transferred to the 155th brigade and were told that from this day on, you are now marines, and the next day, relatively speaking, they went into battle.”&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>While Russia is believed to be sending additional troops to replace those it lost in places like Vuldehar, Budanov doesn’t believe Moscow has reserves of well-trained fighters to draw on, leading him to another prediction.</p>



<p>“I am sure it will be over in a fairly short time.” he says.&nbsp; “I don&#8217;t share the opinion that this conflict will last long for one simple reason, Russia realizes that it cannot drag it out for long.&nbsp;With all their actions, they are trying to show that they are ready for a long-term conflict, but in reality, it&#8217;s the exact opposite.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Budanov predicts that the coming months will see decisive battles that will significantly impact how this war ends.&nbsp; And his prediction about the end leads right back to Crimea, the area of Ukraine that was taken by Russian force in 2014, with no real cost imposed by the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It all started there, and it will end there, with the return of Crimea,” he tells The Cipher Brief. “Because in any other case, we will only be postponing the conflict for the future and I don&#8217;t think anyone will allow this. What forms and methods will we use to achieve this goal? The answer is any option that allows us to regain control is acceptable to us.&nbsp;That means force and diplomacy. The war did not only begin in Crimea for me. This is where it started for our whole country and the Russian Federation, too. And this is where it will end.”</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT</strong>:&nbsp; Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said at an annual parliamentary session in Beijing this week, that China is actively <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-must-advance-relations-with-russia-world-becomes-more-turbulent-2023-03-07/">working to advance</a> relations with Russia &#8220;as the world becomes more turbulent.&#8221; The announcement comes as Western countries warn China against providing lethal aid to Russia in support of it&#8217;s war in Ukraine.  China has denied plans for arms transfers and has floated a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-eu-react-reservedly-chinese-ceasefire-proposal-ukraine-2023-02-24/">proposal</a> for a political settlement.  As Chinese-Russian relations intensify, the world is left to wonder if expanded ties will enable Russia, either directly or indirectly, to sustain its aggressive military ambitions in Ukraine. </p>
<p>“I think China, with their peace proposal, — although a lot of it is disingenuous, we know that — it should be given a shot because China and Xi have influence on Russia,” said <strong> Ambassador Joseph DeTrani,</strong> one of several experts <em>The Cipher Brief</em> engaged for a discussion of what year two of the Ukraine conflict might bring, and the role China might play.  “I think Xi can moderate Putin significantly,” DeTrani said. “There&#8217;s an opportunity there, and I think we could use it and we could use it smartly.  But just vilifying and making China the enemy and going into a <a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/opinion/we-may-already-be-in-a-cold-war-with-china">new Cold War</a>, is not going to address the issues in Ukraine.”</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT</strong>:  The privately-owned Russian soldier-for-hire group known as the Wagner Group once operated in the shadows but in the past year, it has become an important part of Russia’s war machine in Ukraine. The group&#8217;s leader <strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong> is a trusted Kremlin ally but recent comments criticizing Russian defense ministry officials are raising questions about just how much influence the group and it&#8217;s owner, actually wield.  </p>
<p>Russia’s war in Ukraine has added to the notoriety and mystique of this private military company (PMC).  Recently, though, long-simmering tensions between Wagner and Russia’s mainline military have erupted into the open.  In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/world/europe/wagner-russia-military-prigozhin.html">audio message</a> published by his own press service, Prigozhin took Russian military officials to task for withholding weapons and ammunition that he says are desperately needed by Wagner forces on the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT</strong> — If President Joe Biden’s recent remarks in Poland and President Vladimir Putin’s in Moscow just a day later are any indication of the path forward, the February 24 anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine may represent the beginning of a new and potentially much more dangerous phase of the conflict, which is increasingly looking like a conflict between NATO and the Russian Federation. Add to that, ominous signals from Beijing and Tehran that this conflict could get much bigger as the leaders of those autocracies start to understand the consequences of a Russian defeat for their own regimes.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the symbolism of President Biden reaching Kyiv before President Putin and where this conflict may be headed.</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT:</strong>  The potential of quantum is unquestioned, and far-reaching.  It could create unbreakable encryption (and render current encryption methods useless), propel advances in artificial intelligence, and even accelerate the development of drugs and medical treatments.  That broad sweep of possible outcomes explains why investments are pouring into the field from around the globe.  And as governments and companies announce new initiatives and strategies for quantum, especially intense is the R&amp;D taking place in three sectors – <strong>quantum computing, sensors, and communications</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE BIG QUESTIONS:</strong>&nbsp; As the global race for quantum breakthroughs intensifies, what will be the impact on economies, national security, and life on the planet?  Who will, and who will not, benefit economically from quantum advances?&nbsp; And what is the potential for world powers to enter into an unprecedented era of “<strong>quantum warfare</strong>”?</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT</strong>:&nbsp;A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/25/world/russia-ukraine-news">crucial decision by Germany</a> to provide Leopard II main battle tanks to Ukraine and to allow other Leopard-equipped militaries to do the same means the powerful battlefield vehicles will have an impact in the areas where fighting is the most intense. As part of the deal, the Biden Administration also overcame early reluctance and announced the U.S. will deliver a number of Abrams tanks to Kyiv as well.</p>
<p><strong>THE BIG QUESTION</strong>:&nbsp; Will the battle tanks arrive quickly enough to have an impact in the face of an expected Russian offensive, and can Ukraine use these weapons and other Western systems to spearhead their own battlefield initiatives?</p>

<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> &#8212; As the Russian war against Ukraine enters its 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;month, Moscow has fallen dramatically short of the military goals it set out last February.&nbsp; After initial gains in the first weeks of the war, the Russian military struggled to consolidate its positions and suffered embarrassing setbacks, forcing retreats in multiple areas.  </p>
<p>Portions of Ukraine that Moscow currently controls, are limited to the south and east of the country and are estimated to represent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/21/russia-territory-gains-ukraine-war/">less than 20%</a> of Ukraine&#8217;s total territory.  </p>

<p><strong><em>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</em></strong><em> — Change is a constant in the Middle East as the past several months have demonstrated with focused attention on protests in Iran, potential changes in the Saudi Arabia-China relationship and dealing with climate change, which has rocked the region in substantive ways.</em></p>
<p><em>More than 500 people have been killed in Iran since protests erupted in September following the death of 22-year-old <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/events-iran-since-mahsa-aminis-arrest-death-custody-2022-10-05/">Mahsa Amini</a>, who was in police custody on a charge of violating the country’s mandatory hijab law, when she died.&nbsp;Her death sent outraged Iranians to the streets calling for change, in protests that have been met with force from the regime.&nbsp;At least two protesters have been executed and dozens more have been sent to prison.&nbsp;Yet protests continue.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> — Australia has suffered enormous back-to-back cyberattacks in recent months. The first major attack hit Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecommunications company, in September. The breach compromised the personal and medical data of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/01/medibank-case-closed-stolen-data-released/">10 million customers</a>. Weeks later, another attack hit Australia’s biggest health-insurer Medibank Private Ltd, leaking the data of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-inc-roiled-by-raft-cyberattacks-this-year-2022-11-07/">9.7 million</a> of the company’s past and present customers.</p>
<p>The Optus and Medibank hacks compromised the data of a total of 14 million customer accounts. The <a href="https://www.afp.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/statement-afp-commissioner-reece-kershaw-medibank-private-data-breach">Australian Federal Police</a> (AFP) said they believe those responsible for the breach are in Russia but has yet to formally identify them.&nbsp;Cybersecurity experts say that the hackers may be linked to the Russian-backed REvil ransomware gang.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE</strong> — <em>The COP27 conference in late November put climate change back on the agenda. The summit ended with an historic agreement to establish a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130832">loss and damage fund</a> to support countries already ravaged by the effects of climate change. However, there was little progress on other areas such as reducing emissions.</em></p>



<p><em>COP27 came after another year in the wake of climate disasters. From <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/11/24/20000-died-amid-punishing-heatwaves-and-record-temperatures-across-western-europe-this-summer-data-indicates/?sh=5ddbdb896ab8">heatwaves in Europe</a> to catastrophic <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/10/28/pakistan-flood-damages-and-economic-losses-over-usd-30-billion-and-reconstruction-needs-over-usd-16-billion-new-assessme">flooding in Pakistan</a> to the worst drought in the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1139836511/the-worlds-response-to-hunger-crisis-in-east-africa-is-inadequate-say-aid-worker">Horn of Africa</a> in 40 years, climate disasters caused billions in damages and economic losses and killed thousands in 2022.</em></p>



<p><em>Beyond immediate human costs and physical destruction, climate change is set to exacerbate geopolitical tensions in various ways. Experts say displacement and food insecurity from climate disasters will magnify <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/12/02/1140278088/climate-change-is-making-vulnerable-countries-more-so">migration and refugee crises</a> and political unrest. Climate-induced changes to the physical environment will open new points of conflict, such as with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-29/how-climate-change-impacts-water-by-thinning-rivers-and-erasing-glaciers#xj4y7vzkg">resource scarcity</a> and the opening of new strategic waterways in the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/10/07/white-house-arctic-strategy-calls-for-enhanced-military-presence/">Arctic</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Recently, climate discussions have also begun to better acknowledge national security risks in the clean energy shift needed to combat climate change.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Expert Perspective</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: How are we doing in bringing sustainability to our security policies?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Monaghan</em></strong>: We&#8217;re making progress on green energy initiatives and climate change initiatives as a country, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re any much different. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve kind of melded the two. I think we understand the implications of climate change, extreme weather, but I don&#8217;t think it rises to the level of urgency that we might think it should. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about urgency if there&#8217;s some big hurricane or whatever, but then it kind of falls off the radar.</p>



<p>Climate change, pandemic, it&#8217;s an actorless threat, and it&#8217;s a lot harder to pin it on an enemy. That&#8217;s kind of how we still think in terms of national security. &#8220;Who&#8217;s the adversary?&#8221; I think we&#8217;re getting there, but I think we still have a ways to go.</p>



<p><strong><em>Goodman</em></strong>: I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s a greater recognition of the security implications of climate change today than there was decades ago because lives and livelihoods are being lost on a daily basis. Societies like Pakistan are being destabilized with every increasing catastrophic flood event that mixes in with the other instabilities in society, in a weak governing system that already had inequities in food and water distribution, that&#8217;s nuclear armed, that&#8217;s subject to a lot of outside influences, taking advantage of vulnerable populations.</p>



<p>We now see that climate change is a threat multiplier in every region of the world and that it magnifies all the existing security threats we face. It makes things more complicated in this world of cascading and compound risks.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hinman:</em></strong> We are starting to ask the right questions about what the inherent security risks are to shifting to a clean energy matrix. For a very long time, climate change security risk discussions have been limited to how changing weather and climatic events might act as an accelerant to existing global risks by increasing the likelihood of things like energy and water shortages or crop collapse. We are now pivoting toward the essential questions of the security risks posed by the transition and clean energy system. Those questions include: What are the systemic geopolitical risks of clean energy technologies? What are the acute technology and supply chain risks for clean energy? What are the systemic vulnerabilities of the clean energy economy? And finally, what types of alliances must we foster today to anticipate and short-circuit the risks of tomorrow?</p>



<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: How has the Ukraine war impacted the shift to clean energy?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Monaghan</em></strong>: The Russian invasion of Ukraine on the one hand has raised issues about, or prompted some to say that this could accelerate a transition. Even the IEA said that. But I think a lot depends on what this winter looks like for Europe. I mean, already we&#8217;ve seen demand for coal increase. There have been public calls in a number of countries for more investments in fossil fuels to heat, and not so many calls for investments in sustainable energy, like solar power, for a variety of reasons. Even before the invasion last year, coal use globally was already surging to record levels. 80 percent of the world&#8217;s energy is still derived from fossil fuels. I think we have a long way to go. I think when you have something kinetic going on, that kind of rises much higher in the national security realm.</p>



<p><strong><em>Goodman:</em></strong>&nbsp;​​​Although there&#8217;s still some near term needs, there&#8217;s a pledge in the EU to go completely off Russian oil and to move off Russian gas as well and, at the same time, to accelerate the energy transition. So I think Putin&#8217;s energy strategy, if you have an energy strategy in this war, has backfired on him in the sense that the Russian economy is deeply dependent on its exports of oil and gas.</p>



<p>And at the same time, that posed a shock to Europe. If it&#8217;s a cold winter in Europe, there could be some hardship in terms of energy supplies. And European countries have asked their citizens to conserve and to be more energy efficient, which we all should. We always forget that efficiency is the fourth fuel in the process. Efficiency is always the cheapest fuel. The less you need, the more you have to do other things.</p>



<p>So I think ironically, Putin&#8217;s war has helped us to accelerate into the energy transition because now one can more clearly see the promise of electrification of vehicle fleets of cars, and we can more clearly see the promise of a distributed energy grid so that you&#8217;re not as vulnerable to attacks on a big centralized grid.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hinman:</em></strong>&nbsp;Many have been operating on the false premise that the clean energy transition can be executed effectively with renewable energy sources alone. The Ukraine war and energy crisis have completely unraveled that notion. While it has been painful, and the human costs of this unconscionable war have been dear, ultimately, the lessons learned about the vulnerabilities in green energy transitions and systems may lead to a more effective and secure clean energy system in the long-term. These lessons include a renewed understanding of the necessity for clean baseload technologies, like nuclear reactors, and a better understanding of the risks of supply chain disruptions to energy systems. As ever, we need energy that is secure, sustainable, and resilient.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: China </em></strong><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3188674/chinas-suspension-climate-talks-us-may-delay-decarbonisation-methane"><strong><em>suspended climate talks</em></strong></a><strong><em> with the US in August over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. The two sides later decided at COP27 to </em></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/business/china-us-climate-change.html#:~:text=BALI%2C%20Indonesia%20%E2%80%94%20President%20Biden%20and,to%20avert%20catastrophic%20global%20warming."><strong><em>restart dialogues</em></strong></a><strong><em> on climate. With this in mind, how does climate fit into US-China relations?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Monaghan:</em></strong> I think part of the reason the US was interested in restarting talks is not just because the need for China to address its emissions issue, but because so many of the other issues that we&#8217;re dealing with China on are so tense — trade issues, the whole chips and semiconductors issue, and tensions over Taiwan after a number of visits by political leaders in the US. I think both the US and China were looking for an avenue to be constructive on.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not optimistic that they&#8217;re going to make a lot of progress. The fact that they&#8217;re actually going to continue to talk is progress, and is an important development. Again, I think part of it is to balance out some of the other really deep tensions, especially on semiconductors and the bans against Chinese technology in US manufacturing. It&#8217;s sort of almost at a state of war. We&#8217;re declaring war against the Chinese economy. So, let&#8217;s have a nice conversation about something that we can agree on that needs to be done.</p>



<p><strong><em>Goodman</em></strong>: There are really three specific ways China could cooperate now that would make a difference. The first is China could join the global methane pledge, and that would help us tackle the most potent greenhouse gas.</p>



<p>Second, one of the other achievements or steps towards achievements at COP27 was some new creative ways of climate financing and recognizing that the way in which multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the IMF have typically granted loans for projects incurs too much debt. They&#8217;re rethinking about how to finance or to provide some loan forgiveness in that. China could be part of that and be part of promoting new creative ways of climate financing.</p>



<p>And then third is promoting global trade in green technologies. In the energy transition, the US and China stand to gain a lot economically from the energy transition, from the growth in renewables, and both economies have slightly different strengths in that. China has traditionally had more strength in manufacturing. The US has traditionally had more strength in entrepreneurship and innovation in the actual technology development. That will matter in making more technologies green and making renewable technologies available to a wider global market at a price that those who are still living in energy poverty can afford.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hinman: </em></strong>I think the most important thing that the US can do to accelerate results from US-Sino climate talks is to develop a set of strategic economic policies to create incentives for China to meet its commitments under the Paris Accords and build ambition in the future. A Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) policy in the United States could go a long way to create market incentives for China to decarbonize.</p>



<p>More critically, I think the United States needs to remain clear-eyed about the moral risks of trading away human rights to meet climate goals. Despite public pressure to provide an exception for solar panels, the Department of Homeland Security has been formidable in defending our values by continuing to halt solar imports from Xinjiang. The US cannot enter a meaningful climate dialogue from a position of strength if the CCP sees that we’re willing to trade our morals for cheap solar panels fabricated in concentration camps.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Cipher Brief: What are some risks we face in building out green energy supply chains?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Goodman:</em></strong> In critical mineral supply chains — for things like cobalt, and lithium, and other rare earth minerals — China is one of the world&#8217;s major global producers of those minerals. The US and others are now trying to expand the places in which those minerals can be mined and accessed to friendlier countries from Australia, to Chile, to Canada. Even in the US, we&#8217;re looking at doing more mining. But it&#8217;s not just the mining, it&#8217;s the whole supply chain. It’s the processing, the extraction, and the various segments of the critical mineral supply chain that need to be knit together in a way that reduces the risks of any one point of it being too overly concentrated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Monaghan:</em></strong> The raw materials needed for green energy projects are often found in parts of the world that are inhospitable. There&#8217;s a high concentration that are only in a few countries, many of whom are rivals, many of whom have been wooed, particularly by China, over the last decade. We&#8217;re playing catch up in the United States to start wooing these countries, and encouraging them to produce these raw materials and provide open access on the global market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s just take a mining company, for example, in the DRC. It may be a national mining company, but China does the development. China&#8217;s funding the extraction and/or the refining. It&#8217;s marketed through a global minerals trading company such as Glencore. It&#8217;s very concentrated in a few hands. Add onto that, in some of these countries you have active sort of civil war situations such as the DRC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For all that we&#8217;re going to need to build in terms of batteries and whatever, it&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s not enough minerals. They&#8217;re actually in fewer hands than you would realize. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, for example, if we had an OPEC of green energy minerals, at some point. Countries and companies get together and form some kind of a cartel.</p>



<p>Ten years ago, we were all talking about the death of OPEC. Well, now it&#8217;s in some ways more powerful than ever. Ten, fifteen years ago, most people would&#8217;ve said, &#8220;Oh, OPEC&#8217;s a thing of the past&#8221; because of fracking in the United States. Things change. When you have tightness in the fossil fuel market, those who didn&#8217;t have as much power ten, fifteen years ago, all of a sudden emerge more powerful again.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hinman:</em></strong> The most immediate issue with clean energy is where we are sourcing our technologies and upstream mineral supply chains.</p>



<p>Two critical security risks emerge here: First, we should be worried about sourcing energy and grid technologies from adversaries. I am always concerned about the potential for national champions or state-owned enterprises programming in kill switches to the energy critical technologies they sell us. Second, the increasing concentration of mineral processing and critical componentry to a single point of failure in the supply chain is an extreme risk we have been living with for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the past twenty years or so we were able to squeeze so much efficiency out of the global economy that we forgot to account for the risk of handing one party a critical node in the energy supply chain. The upside of recent supply chain disruptions is that everyone understands this now, but it will take time to turn this ship and diversify supply chains. I’m concerned whether we have enough runway to execute on this transition in time to deter conflict in East Asia in particular.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERT ANALYSIS</strong> — Deep tech ventures have steadily gained stature as keystones of future economic and national security success. This sector nevertheless faces stiff challenges. Deep tech projects typically require lengthy R&amp;D cycles and large capital investment before they break into use.&nbsp;They are characterized by a high level of uncertainty and technical risk. When successful, however, they often create broad market acceptance and dual use applications. </p>
<p>For national security, much attention has been paid to AI-enabled weapons and intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) systems. These comprise a natural growth area for deep tech innovations, and cover tactical platforms to major air, naval, subsurface, and space armaments and technologies.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERT PERSPECTIVE </strong>&#8212; An explosion last week, in the eastern Polish village of Przewodow, killed two people and created heightened concern about just how quickly the war in Ukraine could escalate into a global conflict.&nbsp;<br>The Cipher Brief compiled a tic-toc of what happened, telling the story of how a single missile brought into sharp focus, the risks that are truly at play in Ukraine.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Polish Radio ZET reported that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/explosion-kills-two-poland-near-ukraine-border-2022-11-15/">two stray missiles</a> caused the blast.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-ap-news-alert-europe-poland-government-and-politics-ba48101fd25c86e68e57dc56fe2adf80">The Associated Press</a> cited a senior US intelligence official saying Russian missiles had crossed into Poland.<br></li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3219541/pentagon-press-secretary-air-force-brig-gen-pat-ryder-holds-an-on-camera-press/">Pentagon</a> initially said it could not confirm reports that Russian missiles had landed in Polish territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-defence-ministry-denies-russian-missiles-struck-polish-territory-2022-11-15/">Russian Defense Ministry</a> denied the reports, calling the allegations “a deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation.”&nbsp; It added that Russia did not hit targets near the Ukrainian-Polish border and that debris found at the site of the blasts had “nothing to do with Russian weapons.”<br></li>



<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/15/russia-ukraine-war-g20-latest-updates/#link-QGOTOAGTOFD2LDZMIUZJVKVIXQ">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> later said, without providing evidence, that Russian missiles hit Poland. He called the attack on “the territory of our friendly country” an “attack on collective security” and said it marked a “significant escalation” in the conflict with Russia.<br></li>



<li>In response to the blasts, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Marawiecki held an emergency <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-missiles-poland-kill-two/32132371.html">Security Council</a> meeting. The Polish government also <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/poland-puts-military-units-on-heightened-readiness-01668547807">raised military readiness</a>.<br></li>



<li>Polish President Andrzej Duda spoke with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3737169-biden-speaks-with-polish-president-duda-after-russia-missile-strike/">President Joe Biden</a> about the blasts. The White House said Biden reiterated to Duda that the US has an “ironclad commitment to NATO.”&nbsp;<br></li>



<li>Duda also discussed the incident with <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/nato-chief-says-important-all-facts-established-over-poland-explosion-01668547807?tesla=y">NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg</a>, who said it was important to find all the facts behind the causes of the explosion.<br></li>



<li>A Polish government spokesman said Poland is considering whether it will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-considering-nato-article-4-activation-says-spokesman-2022-11-15/">call NATO for discussions under Article 4</a>, which states that an alliance member can call for consultations when it feels its “territorial integrity, political independence or security” are at risk.</li>

<p>&#8220;If this was an accident, the instinct in Warsaw and Washington will be caution and restraint, with Article 4 discussions signaling the Russians not to screw up again,&#8221; Cipher Brief Expert and former Acting Director of CIA John McLaughlin told us. </p>

<p><br><em>The incident sparked alarm and calls for the defense of NATO territory across central and eastern Europe, putting squarely into focus the question of just how quickly NATO would be ready to launch a response and what that response might look like.</em><br></p>



<ul>
<li>Latvia appeared to explicitly accuse Russia of causing the blasts. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pabriks/status/1592588505393541122">Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks</a> tweeted, “Criminal Russian regime fired missiles which targeted not only Ukrainian civilians but also landed on NATO territory in Poland.”</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Estonia expressed solidarity with Poland as well as its willingness to “defend every inch of NATO territory,” according to a tweet from the <a href="https://twitter.com/MFAestonia/status/1592591979963371521">Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>. However, Estonia did not explicitly blame Russia for the blasts.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lithuanian-president-says-every-inch-nato-territory-must-be-defended-2022-11-15/">Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda</a> likewise expressed solidarity with Poland and called for “every inch of NATO territory” to be defended, according to a tweet. He said “the cause of the explosions is not yet known,” but added that they happened as Russia launched missile strikes in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/hungary-s-defence-council-meeting-over-poland-missile-reports-01668543007?refsec=topics_afp-news">Hungary</a> convened a defense council meeting to discuss the blasts, as well as disruptions to oil flows through the Druzhba pipeline.<br></li>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know enough yet about the strike,&#8221; cautioned Cipher Brief Expert and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Admiral Jim Stavridis (Ret.).&nbsp; </p>

It could also cause NATO to provide MIG-29 aircraft to the Ukrainians from Poland, with US backfilling with F-16s. And it may cause a serious discussion about putting a no-fly zone up over Ukraine, manned by NATO fighters.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>The Morning After</strong></p>



<p>The Polish Foreign Ministry released a statement early Wednesday saying that a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-kherson-9202c032cf3a5c22761ee71b52ff9d52?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">Russian-made missile</a> caused an explosion in eastern Poland that killed two people.&nbsp; The ministry said it summoned the Russian ambassador and “demanded immediate detailed explanations” for the blasts.</p>



<ul>
<li>Polish President Andrzej Duda then appeared to step back from a full-throated condemnation of Russia, saying there is no conclusive evidence showing who fired the missiles and that investigations are ongoing. He added that the explosion appeared to be a “one-off” incident. He also said it is likely Poland will ask for consultations under Article 4 at a planned <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/15/what-is-article-5-nato/">North Atlantic Council meeting</a> on Wednesday.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>President Joe Biden convened an emergency meeting of NATO and G7 leaders gathered in Bali for a G20 summit to discuss the missile blast. He told reporters that, according to “preliminary information,” he thinks “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/15/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-explosion-and-loss-of-life-in-eastern-poland/">it is unlikely</a>” the missile was fired from Russia due to its trajectory, but said he would not make any conclusions until the Polish investigation is completed.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Three US officials tell The Associated Press that preliminary findings suggest that the missile that landed in Poland was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-kherson-9202c032cf3a5c22761ee71b52ff9d52?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">fired by Ukrainian forces</a> in an attempt to intercept an incoming Russian missile.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Polish President Andrzej Duda says the explosion was “very likely” an “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/16/poland-president-ukraine-russia-missile">unfortunate accident</a>” caused by an Ukrainian air defense missile, rather than any “intentional attack.” He added that the missile was “most likely” Russian-made, but that there is no current evidence that Russian forces fired it.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Duda’s conclusion, though he emphasized that “this is not Ukraine’s fault” and that “Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.”</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>What Did We Learn?</strong></p>



<p>Among other things, we learned how dangerously close a single missile can come to escalating an already tense situation to a higher level of global conflict.&nbsp; We learned how quickly information is shared and we saw how NATO countries were at least thinking about responding, if the missile had in fact, been fired by Russia.&nbsp; While the lessons from this single incident are worth noting, so too is the bigger picture.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;In 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the response of the West was inadequate. Russia got to hold on to 20% of the nation of Georgia,&#8221; Cipher Brief Expert and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Phil Breedlove (Ret.) told us.

<p style="color: white; background: #0A1531; padding: 9px 13px 9px 13px; font-size: 18px; font-family: ‘replica-pro’, arial, sans-serif">&#8220;The western world rewarded Russia&#8217;s bad behavior. In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and took 11 or 12% of Ukrainian territory. Moscow threatened to huff and puff and blow our house down with World War III or their nukes. Once again, the west capitulated and allowed them to hang on to a big chunk of Ukraine. For the second time, we rewarded bad behavior.&nbsp; We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that we&#8217;re back now for a third time. Russia has seized another big part of Ukraine. And when the west starts to respond, Russia has huffed and puffed and threatened to blow our house down with World War III and nukes. And they fully expect us to capitulate a third time. We in the West are at a point of decision, are we going to, for the third time, reward bad behavior? The West and the Western world have a decision to make. Mr. Putin is huffing and he&#8217;s puffing and he&#8217;s threatening to blow our house down and we need to decide how we&#8217;re going to respond.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what I know for sure: If we capitulate and allow Russia to hold onto even more Ukrainian territory, we&#8217;ll be back here again in 2025 and 2028 and 2031 and 2033. It&#8217;s time for us to step up.&#8221;</p>
