<p>By Steven Pifer</p><p>On April 3, the Polish government confirmed that it had delivered <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/04/03/first-polish-mig-29-fighter-jets-arrive-in-ukraine-warsaw-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiG-29 fighters</a> to Ukraine, just 11 days after the first <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/slovakia-ukraine-mig-29-fighter-jets-delivery/32331248.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slovakian MiG-29s</a> arrived in that beleaguered country. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64988504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> the provision of the aircraft and suggested they would be destroyed, but he voiced no threat of escalation. Likewise, the arrival of the first German Leopard and British Challenger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/world/europe/ukraine-challenger-leopard-2-tanks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tanks</a> in Ukraine in late March drew a <a href="https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news/the-kremlin-germany-is-arming-ukraine-and-is-increasingly-embroiled-in-the-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively mild</a> reaction from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>The Kremlin’s red lines — never clearly articulated — appear less stringent than some in the West evidently believe. There remains space for expanded U.S. and Western military assistance to Kyiv that would not cross the lines that appear to have emerged over the past year.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Russia’s massive invasion of Ukraine 13 months ago, Biden administration officials have voiced two primary goals for U.S. policy regarding the war: first, help Ukraine prevail and defeat Russia militarily; and second, avoid a direct military clash between NATO and Russia. These are the right goals. However, in balancing the two, the administration has taken an unnecessarily cautious approach.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden reiterated his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/21/remarks-by-president-biden-ahead-of-the-one-year-anniversary-of-russias-brutal-and-unprovoked-invasion-of-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Ukraine</a> in a February 21 speech in Warsaw, the day after he had made a quick visit to Kyiv. The degree of U.S. and Western support has increased as the Ukrainian military demonstrated its ability to stand up to the Russian army. He has also <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnr/date/2022-03-11/segment/04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made clear</a> his second goal in another speech on March 11: “We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine. Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III, something we must strive to prevent.”</p>
<p>The trick for Washington and other NATO members providing military aid to Ukraine has been to calculate how far they can go without crossing a red line that would trigger a direct NATO-Russia clash. One factor complicating that calculation: The Kremlin has provided no clear specifics as to what it regards as unacceptable. In the early weeks of the war, <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/tacit-rules-to-avoid-nato-russia-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tacit rules</a> appeared to have developed between the West and Russia regarding military assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a February 2023 interview, Russian foreign and security policy expert Alexei Arbatov addressed the question of <a href="https://russiancouncil.ru/analytics-and-comments/comments/vozgonka-vooruzheniy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moscow’s red lines</a>, which he also qualified as tacit. He described the first as “NATO countries are not directly involved in the conflict, although they supply weapons, and Russia does not strike at NATO countries.”</p>

<p>Biden, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and other NATO leaders have repeatedly said that they would not send U.S. or NATO forces to defend Ukraine. That explains why the idea of a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/no-fly-zone-nato-far-rejected-calls-one-ukraine-rcna18918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no-fly zone over Ukraine</a> encountered such resistance one year ago. It would have required that NATO pilots be prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft and to attack Russian surface-to-air missile sites, perhaps in Russia itself.</p>
<p>Nothing suggests the West’s position on this has changed, even as the war drags on and the list of Russian war crimes grows. Indeed, Ukraine has not asked for Western troops, just weapons. U.S. and NATO policy remains well short of the first red line described by Arbatov.</p>
<p>His second red line was that “NATO countries do not supply long-range missiles for strikes deep into the territory of the Russian Federation.” This question also does not arise. As Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3665997-ukraine-will-not-use-western-weapons-for-strikes-on-russian-territory-reznikov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> on February 5, “We always emphasize to our Western partners that we will not use Western weapons [to launch strikes] on the territory of the Russian Federation.”</p>
<p>It is an absurd war in which the Russian military can hit targets, military or civilian, throughout Ukraine while seeking to somehow bar Ukraine from striking targets in Russia. However, Kyiv has indicated that it will play by those rules, at least when it uses Western-provided weapons. The Ukrainians would like to get the 200-mile range Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, which would allow them to strike Russian targets anywhere in occupied Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian military has had the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, since last June and resisted the temptation to launch its 50-mile-range rockets against targets in Russia. The missiles reportedly were modified so they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-altered-himars-rocket-launchers-to-keep-ukraine-from-firing-missiles-into-russia-11670214338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot target sites</a> inside Russia. Was that necessary? Ukrainian leaders are too smart to do something that would endanger the continuing supply of needed U.S. arms.</p>
<p>Arbatov’s red lines sound right and seem consistent with Kremlin reactions to date. The lack of a harsher response to the West’s provision of arms suggests his assessment is on the mark.</p>
<p>The United States and other partners of Ukraine thus can provide more arms while not crossing these red lines: additional tanks and infantry fighting vehicles for counteroffensives to drive back the occupying Russian army; the ATACMS missile, limited to use against targets in occupied Ukraine; and even fighter aircraft, which Ukraine could use for air defense and close air support of its counteroffensives without flying against targets in Russia. Giving Ukraine the capabilities to break out of a debilitating war of attrition and engage in maneuver warfare would provide Kyiv the chance to prevail on the battlefield. That offers the best way to foreshorten the war.</p>
<p>To be sure, Moscow will not like this. But if the Kremlin has solid red lines, they appear to focus on effects, e.g., do they lead to strikes on Russian territory? As for the weapons themselves, Russian officials grumble but do not make extravagant threats. In any case, to the extent that the Russians react militarily, that reaction, as it has over the past year, would focus on Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians have repeatedly made clear they will accept that risk; they want the weapons. The West should provide them.</p>

<p>By Alastair Iain Johnston, Tsai Chia-hung, George Yin</p><p>For a time, it looked as though House Speaker Kevin McCarthy would make a high-profile visit to Taiwan this spring. There was some suggestion that this might lead Beijing to react even more coercively than it did after the previous speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visited in August 2022. Perhaps for that reason, McCarthy will now have a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen when she transits through Los Angeles, California. Depending on how McCarthy frames his support for Tsai, however, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) might still escalate its military operations around Taiwan to signal its opposition to the alleged “hollowing out” of the U.S. “One China” policy. Depending on the scale of these actions, some Taiwanese voters might again conclude that such symbolic demonstrations of support risk entrapping Taiwan in an escalating U.S.-China rivalry.</p>

<p>According to recent surveys we conducted in Taiwan, a majority of respondents believe that Pelosi’s visit was detrimental to Taiwan’s security. At first glance, this seems surprising. In a triangular relationship between a patron state (the United States) and its client (Taiwan) on the one hand, and a shared adversary (China) on the other, one might normally expect the client to welcome visible and credible signals of support.</p>
<p>However, even as its security environment appears to be deteriorating, a client might not welcome signals of support from the patron if the client considers those signals to be so provocative that they undermine its security. Typically, it is the patron that worries about entrapment by its client, while the client worries about abandonment by the patron. But our surveys suggest that a considerable portion of Taiwanese voters worry about entrapment by the United States. There are, of course, partisan differences concerning fears of entrapment. Supporters of the Kuomintang (KMT) and independents worry that the convergence of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and U.S. preferences toward strategic competition with China makes Taiwan less secure.</p>
<p>This concern about entrapment appears to have increased after Pelosi’s visit. We conducted a panel survey in Taiwan with two waves, one in September 2022 and a second in January 2023, to gauge the Taiwanese public’s reaction to Pelosi’s very public demonstration of support for Taiwan. In 2022, we asked respondents, in the wake of Pelosi’s visit and the PRC’s unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan, whether Taiwan faced a serious threat. In January 2023, we followed with a slightly different question about whether Pelosi’s travel had made Taiwan more or less secure.</p>
<p>In September 2022, respondents overwhelmingly believed that Pelosi’s trip and the large-scale People’s Liberation Army exercises created a serious threat to Taiwan. Somewhat surprisingly, this response was similar across the political partisan divide in Taiwan (Figure 1). <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-04/pelosi-visit-taiwan-china-response-taiwanese-australian-views/101295636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Media reports</a>, in both Taiwan and the West, have suggested that many Taiwanese citizens did not originally seem too bothered by China’s reactions.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, the majority of respondents in the January 2023 survey still believed that Pelosi’s visit made Taiwan less secure (Figure 2). But partisan differences were clearer in the answers to this question than they had been in September. A majority of KMT supporters and independents (as well as one-third of DPP supporters) believed that Pelosi’s visit had made Taiwan less secure (Figure 3). By contrast, a majority of DPP supporters felt the opposite was true.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="lazyautosizes lazyload wp-image-1682623 size-article-outset alignnone" src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1.png?w=1000&amp;h=750&amp;crop=1" alt="Figure 1 Were China's military exercises after Pelosi's visit a serious threat to Taiwan's security?" width="1000" height="750" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig1.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="lazyautosizes lazyload wp-image-1682624 size-article-inline alignnone" src="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?w=768&amp;h=2057&amp;crop=1" alt="Figure 2 Effect of Pelosi's visit on Taiwan's security" width="768" height="2057" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?w=768&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?w=768&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 768w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?fit=600%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 600w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?fit=400%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 400w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig2.png?fit=512%2C9999px&amp;ssl=1 512w" /></p>
<p>Indeed, by January 2023, 52% of our DPP respondents had shifted to the conclusion that Taiwan was more secure in the wake of the visit. In contrast, only 21% of the independent respondents and 11% of the KMT respondents had done so.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="5060" height="1430" class="alignnone wp-image-1682625 size-article-outset lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;quality=1#038;ssl=1" sizes="916px" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" alt="Figure 3 Effect of Pelosi's visit on Taiwan's security" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig3.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" /></p>
<p>Such a shift may have resulted from reassuring U.S. policy initiatives or confirmation bias, or both. For example, by January 2023, some DPP supporters may have been responding to the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade and a $12 billion military aid program. Alternatively, some DPP supporters may have perceived, or wanted to perceive, a change in U.S. policy after our first survey in September 2022 and looked for evidence for their beliefs. Based on answers to other questions we asked in the 2023 survey about the likelihood of possible gestures of U.S. support for Taiwan, those DPP respondents who shifted their perception of Taiwan’s security in a more positive direction between surveys also believed that the United States would diplomatically recognize Taiwan, would send troops to defend Taiwan if attacked by the PRC, and would conclude a trade agreement with Taiwan.</p>
<h2><strong>A “Folk theory” of Taiwanese Security?</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to asking respondents about the impact of Pelosi’s visit on Taiwan’s security, we also probed the panel respondents about whether they had a “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/56/2/245/1796298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">folk theory</a>” of security — that is, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26379509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intuitions</a> about the factors influencing Taiwan’s security based on their own biases and lived experiences. We gave respondents five common explanations for cross-strait instability and asked them whether they agreed or disagreed with each.</p>

<p>A large portion of respondents appears to have a relatively plausible multi-causal “theory” of how Taiwan’s security is threatened (Figure 4). A large majority agrees that the PRC’s aggressive intentions are a source of instability. A smaller majority believes that increasing levels of support for independence in Taiwan is a source of instability. And only about 55% attribute instability to shifts in U.S. policy toward a “One China, One Taiwan policy.” On the other hand, majorities of respondents tended not to attribute instability to the neglect of defense building in Taiwan or to U.S. strategic ambiguity. Together these results suggest that many voters essentially lean toward the ideas embedded in the traditional U.S. policy of dual deterrence: Taiwan is more secure when the PRC’s aggressive intentions are countered and when the PRC is assured that U.S. policy does not encourage formal independence.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly there are partisan differences. DPP supporters are more likely to blame inadequate military spending as a source of instability than KMT supporters and independents (Figure 5). Similarly, while KMT supporters and independents do not think U.S. strategic ambiguity is a source of instability, a small majority of DPP supporters does (Figure 6). While all groups attribute instability to the PRC’s aggressive intentions, DPP supporters overwhelmingly do so (Figure 7). Interestingly, all groups also agree that greater support in Taiwan for independence is a source of instability, though a smaller majority of DPP supporters agree than others (Figure 8). Not surprisingly, a large majority of KMT supporters agree that the hollowing out of the U.S. “One China” policy is a source of instability, but independents and DPP supporters are relatively evenly split (Figure 9).</p>

<h2><strong>Implications</strong></h2>
<p>Our surveys have a couple of tentative implications for policy discussions in Washington about how to preserve Taiwan’s security.</p>
<p>First, our data suggests that if a substantial constituency in the client state believes such high-profile signals of support are counterproductive, this can weaken the security relationship between patron and client, making coordinated responses to the common adversary more difficult. A McCarthy-Tsai meeting, or a McCarthy visit to Taiwan, may only be prospectively reassuring to a majority of Taiwanese if they believe that the PRC response will be milder than it was after Pelosi’s visit. And if China does react less coercively after McCarthy’s symbolic actions, then it is possible that, retrospectively, at least some KMT and independent voters may conclude such actions are a useful signal of support. On the other hand, even a slightly less threatening PRC response may not be reassuring enough to KMT and independent voters, given their concerns about entrapment. Our surveys suggest that KMT supporters, and to some degree independents, do not identify culturally or politically with the United States nearly as much as DPP respondents do (Figure 10). And as Figure 4 suggests, many KMT supporters and independents blame growing support for independence as a source of cross-strait instability. So, it may be unlikely that many KMT and independents will interpret a McCarthy-Tsai meeting as a useful symbol of U.S. support in the face of PRC coercion, especially if it is viewed as a partisan statement of support for the DPP government.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="5018" height="1434" class="alignnone lazyload wp-image-1682632 size-article-outset" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig10.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;quality=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Figure 10 Are U.S. and Taiwanese values identical?" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig10.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig10.png?fit=1000%2C750px&amp;ssl=1 1000w,https://i0.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fig10.png?fit=500%2C375px&amp;ssl=1 500w" /></p>
<p>A second implication of our results concerns the effectiveness of deterrence. Washington’s discourse about how to deter the PRC emphasizes military tools over the synergistic effects of assuring Beijing that the United States is not encouraging or enabling formal Taiwanese independence. Proponents of dual deterrence claim that, since 1972, credible coercion and credible assurance have kept the probability of a PRC takeover of Taiwan relatively low and will likely continue to be more successful compared to alternative U.S. strategies, such as allowing and/or recognizing a de jure independent Taiwan. This may or may not be the case. There is a <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/how-avoid-war-over-taiwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debate</a> over whether <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/taiwan-long-game-best-solution-jude-blanchette-ryan-hass">dual </a><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/taiwan-long-game-best-solution-jude-blanchette-ryan-hass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deterrence</a> is the best of a bad set of <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/we-can-only-kick-taiwan-down-the-road-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options</a> for reducing the probability of conflict. But our analysis of respondents’ “folk theory” of security suggests that a considerable portion of the Taiwanese population seems to agree with the dual deterrence notion. This may be the conceptual basis for their concern about entrapment by U.S. politicians.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The 2022 household telephone survey was conducted between September 22 and 29, 2022, by the Election Study Center, National Chengchi University. We randomly drew samples according to the area codes of telephone books. Only respondents who were over 20 years old and registered in Taiwan were eligible for this survey. Data was weighted by gender, age, education, and residence area based on the latest census data. The sample size was 1,127. The margin of error with 95% confidence interval is 2.92%. The 2023 panel study was conducted between January 5 and 9, 2023. We successfully re-interviewed 576 respondents or about 51% of the 2022 sample. The data was also weighted by gender, age, education, and residence area. The main questions we analyze are: “In August this year, U.S. Congress Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, and China immediately held large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. Do you think this is a serious threat to Taiwan&#8217;s security?” (September 2022 survey); and “Do you think Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan made Taiwan more or less secure?” (January 2023 survey).</p>

<p>By Aslı Aydıntaşbaş</p><p>On a recent visit to Istanbul ahead of Turkey’s critical May 14th elections, I was struck by a number of things.</p>

<p>The first was seeing how deeply scarred folks were from the February 6th earthquake — having been hit not only with grief but also the realization that at the end of his 20-year reign, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s hyper-centralized and dysfunctional governance system was partly to blame for the high number of casualties. Erdoğan’s re-election is no longer a foregone conclusion, which makes this election consequential not just for Turkish citizens but for the global balance of power.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, friends, former colleagues, and ordinary people incessantly talked about the elections and the earthquake in the same breath. Many expressed anxieties about an anticipated mega-earthquake in Istanbul and described various escape plans. I ran into people who were stocking up on water in their cars, trying to buy property abroad, or making plans to move to a safer new apartment.</p>
<p>Between the concern about a massive Istanbul earthquake and the upcoming elections, the country seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>I was also taken aback by the fact that nearly everyone had convinced themselves that Erdoğan would lose the upcoming vote. In interviews with journalists, opposition officials, and even bureaucrats, there was almost a blind conviction that this was Erdoğan’s last stand. So over-confident were they about the possibility of an opposition victory that of the dozens of friends and acquaintances I met in Istanbul, only two — one journalist and one media executive — said they believed Erdoğan would win it in the end.</p>
<p>There are, of course, perfectly fine reasons to make that assumption. The opposition bloc which consists of six parties is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/polls-show-erdogan-lags-opposition-by-more-than-10-points-ahead-may-vote-2023-03-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading in the polls</a>. Erdoğan’s <em>authoritarian bargain</em> with Turkish society seems to have collapsed — and younger people want change. With double-digit inflation, the once-efficient system of patronage is now openly criticized for nepotism. The government’s inadequate response to the earthquake has revealed that behind the omnipotent facade of the state, institutions were hollowed out, money was tight, and corruption was rampant. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is no longer able to monopolize politics as it had a decade ago, and as a reflection of that, has seen a <a href="https://haber.sol.org.tr/haber/akpye-ilgi-azaliyor-aday-adaylik-basvurulari-8-binden-3-bine-geriledi-369365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower number of applicants</a> than in previous years to run for parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to be cautious. Elections are still six weeks away and a lot can happen in Turkey in that time frame. I worry about this certainty about change and its implications for Turkish society if Erdoğan is able to hold onto power. For many, that would mean something bigger than losing an election — a sense of being cheated, possibly public outrage, and nihilism about the country’s future. For people on both sides, Turkey’s political fight has come to represent a deeply personal and existential battle.</p>
<p>There is, of course, still a significant constituency that believes Erdoğan is the best person to lead Turkey. (A recent Metropoll survey <a href="https://twitter.com/ozersencar1/status/1642223773259636736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finds</a> that 43.5% think they would or would consider voting for Erdoğan while 51.6% say they won’t.) During Erdoğan’s first decade in power, the AKP’s policies liberalized Turkey and helped lift many citizens out of poverty by expanding social security and services. In the second half of his two-decade rule, Erdoğan skillfully instrumentalized culture wars, nationalism, and identity politics, giving Sunni conservatives a voice in Turkey’s destiny. With a unique combination of neo-Ottomanism and Islamism, he rebranded Turkey as an unstoppable rising power. To the AKP base, Erdoğan is the only man who can “Make Turkey Great Again.”</p>

<p>But for others, Erdoğan is responsible for Turkey’s authoritarian drift and economic despair. For them, world-order issues are secondary to economic survival. Many will be asking themselves, “Who can run the country better?” — or rather, “Under which government am I better off?”</p>
<p>The opposition has argued, somewhat persuasively, that the problem isn’t just Erdoğan himself but the country’s consolidated one-man regime, which has been written into law by a referendum that barely passed in 2017. The “Table of Six,” as the opposition is called, is the somewhat awkward coalition of six parties from the right to social democrats that is externally backed by the pro-Kurdish HDP. Its main pledge is undoing Erdoğan’s one-man regime and restoring the parliamentary system and rule of law.</p>
<p>That this opposition bloc has survived despite a daily barrage of government propaganda and fake news in a highly authoritarian setting is in itself an important testament to Turkish society’s desire for change.</p>
<p>But the opposition’s Achilles’ heel may well be its candidate — the 74-year-old Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP). The former civil servant is a soft-spoken social democrat who hails from Turkey’s Alevi/Alawite minority. The debate around Kılıçdaroğlu resembles the deliberations among U.S. Democrats prior to the 2020 elections. Yes, he is nice and all, but can he slay a dragon? After a year of infighting and drama, the opposition parties finally settled on Kılıçdaroğlu, with the strategy that his ticket would be strengthened by the popular mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş, who would serve as his deputies.</p>
<p>Kılıçdaroğlu is not trying to be another version of Turkey’s mercurial leader. If anything, he has positioned himself as the antithesis of the strongman — the ordinary family man making anti-corruption videos from his middle-class kitchen, the quiet uniter of the many different factions in Turkish society.</p>
<p>But his task is not easy — as this is the country that exported the concept of the “deep state” to the world lexicon, with a long-standing tradition of self-appointed guardians of the regime. Voter suppression is a reality in the Kurdish countryside and controlling the ballots during the counting process is critical to a win. And if Erdoğan’s chances are as low as polls suggest, why is it that Turks think “he seems relaxed”? Perhaps because the Turkish president holds levers of state power and has already used the courts to eliminate some of his key rivals, like Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtaş or İmamoğlu. A splinter opposition party has just soared in polls, <a href="https://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/fatih-altayli-1001/3573758-sonunda-cok-guler-miyiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> supported by government trolls — a tactic used in Hungary and Russia. On top of that, Turkey’s new election law is untested. I suspect this will make things harder for the opposition both in monitoring the vote and in attaining a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>The problems facing Turkey wouldn’t stop with an Erdoğan defeat. The economy is certain to face headwinds — and possibly a currency crisis — immediately after the elections. A post-Erdoğan government’s ability to deal with inflationary pressures and the economic fallout from years of economic folly could be severely restrained if Erdoğan’s AKP manages to hold onto a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Turkish president has sharply pivoted to the right, making alliances with small parties that offer minimal advantages but a huge ideological burden. This includes the New Welfare Party, whose <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/03/turkeys-ruling-alliance-welcomes-islamist-parties-misogynist-agendas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key demand</a> was lifting the law that protects women against domestic violence, and the ultra-conservative HÜDA PAR, a descendent of the infamous Turkish Hezbollah that reigned terror in Kurdish communities in the late 1990s. This poisoned chalice may help Erdoğan here and there, but it is seen as existentially threatening to Turkey’s secularists, Kurds, and Alawites.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me if it is even possible to dream of free elections in Turkey and if Erdoğan would ever concede if he lost. The answer is: yes. If the difference is narrow, say 1% to 2%, forget it. The elections would be contested à la U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. But if the opposition win is bigger than 2%, then it is irreversible. Erdoğan has built his legitimacy on elections and could not contest a decisive win.</p>
<p>The scariest outcome for Turkey would be a neck-and-neck situation, in which both sides claim victory. An effective organization to monitor the ballots across the country on May 14th will be critical for the opposition. In the 2019 local elections, the opposition won Istanbul (and other big cities) due to its vigilance; some <a href="https://twitter.com/akyolinenglish/status/1113610706727964672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observers slept on</a> sealed ballot boxes to prevent rigging. The opposition would have to replicate that across the country, including in the conservative hinterland and the Kurdish countryside.</p>
<p>Turkey will face difficult years ahead no matter who wins. My recent visit made me realize that the country, once a rising star on the periphery of Europe, was broken — broken by earthquakes, economic hardship, and above all, polarization. If the opposition wins, there will be a chance to restore democracy and perhaps even effective economic governance. But the bare-knuckle politics of the last few years will make it hard to build national consensus on key issues.</p>
<p>The election can only, in the best of circumstances, be the beginning of a long process of healing the Turkish political and economic system.</p>
<p>But regardless, it would be good to begin.</p>

<p>By Oona A. Hathaway</p><p>Cast your minds back to just over a year ago. On February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the largest ground war in Europe since the end of World War II. At the time, the situation looked bleak. Many believed that Ukraine had little hope to hold out in the face of a full-out assault by its much larger, better-armed neighbor. Russia’s military <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/europe/russia-ukraine-military-comparison-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far exceeded Ukraine’s</a>: It had nearly five times the number of active military personnel, almost five times the number of armored fighting vehicles, and ten times the number of aircraft. Overall, it spent roughly ten times the amount on its military annually. Perhaps most important, Russia possessed the <a href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest nuclear arsenal</a> on the planet, and it was clear that no state, not even the United States, was prepared to engage it in open warfare as a result. To top it off, Russia held one of the permanent five seats on the United Nations Security Council, which gave it a veto over any enforcement actions that the U.N. might undertake. If there was ever a case where law would capitulate to power, this was it. Indeed, as the war began, it looked like we were witnessing the end of the modern global legal order.</p>

<p>And yet the worst has not come to pass. On the eve of the war, Putin predicted that his “Special Military Operation” would take mere days, and yet here we are more than a year later with the Ukrainian government retaining control over the vast majority of the country. Many of the gains Russia made early in the war have been reversed. And the international system has proven imperfect but robust.</p>
<p>Today, I will consider what the war has taught us about the strengths and weaknesses of the international legal order.</p>
<h2><strong>What is at Stake: The Prohibition on War</strong></h2>
<p>When Russia launched its aggressive war against Ukraine, it violated the prohibition on the use of force embodied in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. Scott Shapiro and I argued in our book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Internationalists-Radical-Outlaw-Remade-World/dp/1501109863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Internationalists</a>,” that this principle is the fundamental underlying international legal principle of the modern era. War, we argued, used to be perfectly legal and legitimate. Indeed, war was a key way in which states resolved their disputes with one another. International law not only did not prohibit war, but it relied on war to enforce its rules. That changed first with the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, which for the first time outlawed war and set in motion a range of legal transformations.</p>
<p>That transformation was reaffirmed in the U.N. Charter at the close of World War II in 1945. The prohibition on the use of force embodied in Article 2(4) of the charter is not just one legal principle; it is the key legal principle on which the rest of the system relies.</p>
<p>When Putin launched his war, he put that underlying principle at risk. But the test of a legal rule — whether domestic or international — is not determined simply by whether it is violated. It is determined, too, by the <em>response</em> when it is violated. We would never say that, for example, there is no value in laws prohibiting theft because theft still takes place. We would point to the fact that when people who steal are caught, there are legal consequences. Those consequences not only aim to punish the person responsible but they are also intended to deter others from engaging in violations in the future.</p>
<p>So, to see whether the law remains effective, we have to look not just at whether Russia violated the law — which it clearly did — but at the consequences that Russia has faced for that illegal war.</p>
<p>But first let me address at the outset a possible source of skepticism: One might reasonably ask whether the prohibition on force had been so eroded even before Russia launched its war in Ukraine that it had become a fiction. No doubt there is some evidence for this claim — not least the United States’ illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its use of force under the controversial “unable and unwilling” theory of self-defense. These actions have been deeply corrosive to the international legal order, and I do not mean to ignore or discount them. Indeed, I have been consistently critical of them for my entire career.</p>
<p>One can recognize these violations have taken place and nonetheless believe that the world of the postwar era is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Internationalists-Radical-Outlaw-Remade-World/dp/1501109863" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkably different</a> than the world that existed when war was perfectly legal and legitimate. Then, states could go to war to settle any complaint or dispute — and they did. They could engage in the conquest of territory and that conquest was generally unquestioningly accepted by all other states. Indeed, from 1816 through 1928, around 250,000 square kilometers of territory were conquered on average every year. Moreover, gunboat diplomacy — in which states were forced into treaties and other arrangements they did not desire — was part of the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>While we can point to cases where the prohibition on war has not been observed — and the United States has been both one of the greatest defenders <em>and</em> one of the greatest offenders in the last several decades — it’s a mistake to suggest that the legal principles are meaningless or ineffective. The modern legal order is grounded in the prohibition on war, even if it is not always perfectly observed.</p>
<h2><strong>The Response of the International Community to the War</strong></h2>
<p>I said earlier that the test of a legal principle is not just whether it is violated, but what response meets that violation. And here we have seen a response much more robust than many expected when this war began. Normally moribund international legal institutions have suddenly sprung to life in response to the illegal invasion. Here, I will detail international community responses of four kinds: condemnation, outcasting, arming, and accountability.</p>
<p>First, international law and international institutions have been used to condemn Russia’s illegal war. As the invasion began, the U.N. Security Council tried to pass a resolution deploring the Russian invasion and demanding the withdrawal of Russian forces from <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-11/arming-ukraine-worth-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine</a>, but Russia vetoed it. Although Russia was able to exercise its veto power on the Security Council to prevent it from mandating any punitive action, the country’s almost complete isolation within the organization was swift and thorough. Soon after <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/russias-perpetual-geopolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a> blocked the resolution, the Security Council activated the long-dormant <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/059/75/PDF/NR005975.pdf?OpenElement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniting for Peace Resolution</a>. That resolution, which was first adopted in 1950, provides that if the Security Council, due to lack of unanimity among the permanent members, fails to exercise its responsibility to maintain international peace and security, the General Assembly will consider the matter immediately with the view to making recommendations to members.</p>
<p>When Russia vetoed Security Council action, the Uniting for Peace Resolution was used to refer the matter to the General Assembly, which voted overwhelmingly to <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demand</a> that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.” Only a small handful of states — Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria — voted with Russia against the resolution. The other countries that <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-02-18/what-if-russia-wins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia </a>might have hoped would support it, most notably China, chose instead to abstain. That majority was sustained through several additional votes, the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/02/1133847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest</a> coming only hours before the conflict entered its second year, with 141 states voting to condemn the war and demand that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally” withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine, and just seven, including Russia, voting against.</p>
<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) also has played a role in condemning the Russian invasion. On February 26, just two days after the invasion began, Ukraine submitted an <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/182/182-20220227-APP-01-00-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application</a> to the ICJ, beginning proceedings against <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-04/what-if-russia-loses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia</a>. The application took Putin’s outrageous and baseless claims that Ukraine was committing genocide in its eastern regions and turns them against him. Russia, as a party to the Genocide Convention, has agreed that the ICJ is the forum at which disputed allegations of genocide may be resolved. In a brilliant act of lawyering, Ukraine seized on this fact and argued that Putin’s claims provide the ICJ grounds for jurisdiction to adjudicate whether, indeed, any such genocide has occurred. The ICJ immediately scheduled a hearing on the matter for March 7. The ICJ then <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/case/182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found against Russia</a>, ordering Russia to cease the war immediately.</p>
<p>Second, international law has been used to “outcast” Russia. Here I use the term outcasting in a specific manner. Drawing on my work with Shapiro, I mean the mechanism for enforcing international law where states exclude the law-violating state, here Russia, from the benefits of international cooperation to which it would otherwise be entitled. Russia has been excluded from a number of international organizations, including the <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/the-russian-federation-is-excluded-from-the-council-of-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Council of Europe</a>. But the main form of outcasting faced by Russia since the war began has been a system of <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/restrictive-measures-against-russia-over-ukraine/sanctions-against-russia-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprecedented economic sanctions</a> that is one of the most expansive the world has seen outside of Security Council-ordered sanctions. I will say more in a moment about whether those sanctions have been effective, but for now, the key point is that the sanctions response has been significant and widespread.</p>
<p>Third, the condemnation and outcasting of Russia have been accompanied by another important development — the arming of Ukraine. The United States alone has <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> over $70 billion in aid to Ukraine, including $44 billion in military aid. The role of law here is less obvious, but it is very much present. Law has a legitimizing value — the states supporting Ukraine are acting in support of a state that is legally in the right. That has been an important part of the political debate in a number of key countries, particularly Germany, but it is important to the willingness of states globally to support Ukraine against Russia’s attempt at illegal conquest. It is, moreover, important that it is <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/supplying-arms-ukraine-not-act-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfectly legal to provide arms</a> and other support to a state that is defending itself against an illegal war and that is abiding by international humanitarian law in the process. By contrast, <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/80709/why-china-giving-military-assistance-to-russia-would-violate-international-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is <em>illegal</em></a> to support a state that, like Russia, is waging an illegal war — as doing so is to aid and assist that state in its internationally wrongful acts.</p>
<p>Fourth, the illegal war has been and will be subject to criminal prosecution and other legal accountability. On February 28, just four days after the invasion began, International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-situation-ukraine-i-have-decided-proceed-opening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that he was seeking authorization to open an investigation as soon as possible. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a party to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC and gives it jurisdiction. But in 2013, Ukraine legally accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes occurring on its territory. On March 2, Khan <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-situation-ukraine-receipt-referrals-39-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that he had received 39 state referrals and that he would immediately proceed with an investigation. Never had the ICC responded so quickly to the outbreak of a conflict.</p>

<p>That investigation has recently resulted in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indictment</a> of both Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, currently the presidential commissioner for children’s rights in the Russian Federation. This is an extraordinary step for international criminal justice.</p>
<p>In addition to criminal accountability, the U.N. General Assembly has also <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed</a> the creation of a reparations mechanism, and there is a significant effort right now to think about how to compensate Ukraine for the damage done by Russia in the course of the war.</p>
<p>All of this response suggests that there have been <em>real consequences</em> for Russia in its violation of the prohibition on war. And while that response has not been sufficient to bring an end to the war, it has sent a clear message that the violation of the prohibition on war remains core to the international system. That message is directed not only at Russia. It is intended, too, for any state considering following in Russia’s footsteps in the future. I think it is safe to say that the robust response will give states considering a similar invasion in the future reason to reconsider.</p>
<p>In short, the response to an illegal war launched by a nuclear-armed state with a veto on the Security Council has been far more effective than anyone had reason to hope at the outset.</p>
<h2><strong>Lessons Learned About the International Legal Order</strong></h2>
<p>We have also learned some important lessons in the course of the war — some hopeful, and some more foreboding — about the international legal order.</p>
<p>One thing we have learned is that the U.N. General Assembly is capable of more than we once thought. From the very start of the war, the Security Council was, predictably, hamstrung. While Russia could not prevent debate of a resolution to condemn the war as illegal, it could exercise its veto to prevent any effective response by the council and thus, it seemed, the U.N, as a whole. But then something unexpected happened: As I mentioned earlier, the members activated the long-dormant Uniting for Peace Resolution. When Russia vetoed the resolution in the Security Council, the General Assembly moved forward with its own resolution. This resulted in a 141-5 vote to condemn the war.</p>
<p>The General Assembly has since voted five more times on issues relating to Ukraine — the most recent of which resulted again in a vote of 141 states voting in favor, and just seven against. In addition, the General Assembly adopted in April 2022 a <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/ga12417.doc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landmark resolution</a> known as the “veto initiative,” which provides that any time a matter is vetoed by a permanent member of the Security Council, it automatically goes to the General Assembly for consideration. This further strengthens the role of the General Assembly as a check on the most powerful states. And there are proposals afoot that would continue to build on this progress.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russia-crime-and-punishment-illegal-war-in-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, which I have advocated, is for the General Assembly to hold a vote that would be the basis for the creation of a Special Tribunal to try the Crime of Aggression in Ukraine. This would be an important step forward for global peace and security — and a critical reaffirmation of the prohibition on war. It would also represent an important institutional step forward for the General Assembly, filling a gap left by the Security Council, which is prevented from protecting the principles on which the United Nations Charter was founded by the veto power of the very state that is violating those principles.</p>
<p>On a less hopeful note, we have seen that sanctions and other outcasting sanctions, while widely adopted, have <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/limits-economic-warfare?utm_source=twitter_posts&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=tw_daily_soc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not had the impact hoped</a>. Obviously, they haven’t brought an end to the war. Russia’s economy took an initial hit, but then largely regained its footing. At first, it seemed the chief challenge was what Shapiro and I called the “too big to outcast” problem — that is, some states are so important to the global economy that states can’t outcast them without placing their own economies at risk.</p>
<p>Early on, we saw this in the reluctance of some European states to place severe sanctions on Russian oil and gas. There were other problems, too. Russia profited from the effects of its own war, which pushed up the price of oil and gas. And there were many states not participating in the sanctions regime that were willing to make up much of the difference from those that are. Many countries, including India, China, and Turkey, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/30/business/economy/russia-trade-ukraine-war.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased trade</a> with Russia even as Western Europe and a number of allied states have significantly cut back their trade with Russia. The United States, meanwhile, has not deployed secondary sanctions that would penalize these states for doing business with Russia, in part because of fears of what that would do to the global economy.</p>
<p>It may be too early to issue a pronouncement about the power or weakness of sanctions, particularly because many of the sanctions were specifically designed to have a growing impact over time. But I think it is necessary to acknowledge that they haven’t yet had the effect one might have wished. I don’t think it should cause us to give up on sanctions as a tool of enforcement, as they are the chief alternative to war. But we do need to engage in more creative thinking about how non-violent consequences for illegal action can be used to enforce the law, especially against states that play an important role in the global economy.</p>
<p>Most challenging, we have been confronted by what might be called the “double standards” problem. This challenge has emerged in many contexts since the war began. The rapid and widespread response to the illegal war was met with some shaking of heads by those familiar with the illegal uses of force that have taken place elsewhere in the world — often under the label of counter-terrorism operations. Meanwhile, calls for a Special Tribunal to try the Crime of Aggression in Ukraine have met with questions about why this war deserves a special court when there has been no accountability for the illegal U.S. war in Iraq. And calls for reparations have been met with some disbelief by those who have suffered the costs of war for decades with no prospect of compensation for homes unlawfully destroyed and family members killed.</p>
<p>The United States has come under special scrutiny in the international arena, meeting with widespread skepticism in much of the world for what some see as its newfound enthusiasm for the prohibition on war and international criminal law accountability. When the war began, after all, the United States had just recently lifted its unprecedented economic sanctions on ICC officials in retaliation for opening an investigation into possible war crimes by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Many looked on in disbelief as U.S. politicians began singing the praises of that very same court and calling for Putin to be indicted.</p>
<h2><strong>A Way Forward</strong></h2>
<p>And yet, we should not refuse to make progress toward a more just world simply because some of the advocates of justice and accountability are not themselves above reproach. We should instead insist on commitments and institutional reforms that will strengthen accountability for all in the future. The war in Ukraine has revealed limitations that long predate this war. We should not rest at pointing out that these problems are far from new. We should see the current urgent desire for solutions as an opportunity to improve the system for all. I’ll end with three opportunities:</p>
<p>First, there is a new opportunity to strengthen and improve international criminal justice. The ICC’s investigation, the largest in its history, has the potential to reduce impunity not only in this war but in wars in the future, as it builds momentum for the work of a court that, after all, was created precisely to establish a mechanism for international criminal law accountability that would not rely on the whims of the Security Council. That has been accompanied by calls for prosecuting the crime of aggression, which, due to limitations on the jurisdiction of the ICC, cannot be prosecuted by the court. If these efforts prove successful, that will send the message that even the most powerful states can be held to account.</p>
<p>Second, there is new recognition that, absent Security Council action, there are very limited tools for obtaining reparations for the damage done in unlawful wars. We should be focused not only on coming up with creative solutions to the reparations challenges for <em>this</em> war but in the process consider how to address similar problems in the future. That can include ensuring robust reparations in connection with international criminal justice trials, but it also includes progressive development of the law allowing for freezing the assets of those who have violated international law and holding those assets until international law obligations to provide reparations for international legal harms have been met.</p>
<p>Last, and potentially most important, the shift in power toward the General Assembly that we have witnessed over the last year is one of those institutional shifts that, once made, will be hard to reverse. In particular, the activation of the Uniting for Peace Resolution and the passage of the veto initiative providing for the automatic referral of resolutions vetoed by a permanent member of the Security Council to the General Assembly strengthen the role of the General Assembly when the Security Council is paralyzed. It is notable that the United States supported the veto initiative, which will apply in the future to resolutions the <em>United States</em> has vetoed. This expanded role for the General Assembly has the prospect of reinvigorating an international institution that has too often been incapacitated by the prospect of a veto in the Security Council.</p>
<p>Russia put the international legal order at risk when it launched its war a year ago. But what has and will determine the future of the international legal order is how nations respond to that violation. If that response is sustained and if the war helps prompt these and other innovations, it is possible that what began as the greatest threat to the international legal order may turn out to be its salvation.</p>

<p>By Reva Dhingra, Marsin Alshamary</p><p>Twenty years after the American-led invasion, Iraq’s seventh prime minister, Mohammad Al-Sudani, has <a href="https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/799968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> corruption to be one of the biggest challenges facing the nation, describing it as “no less serious than the threat of terrorism.” Many of Iraq’s 43 million citizens agree with Sudani, as evidenced by both public opinion <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/ABVII_Iraq_Country_Report-ENG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling</a> and by widespread protest movements, but few connect the crisis of corruption with the 2003 war and subsequent American occupation. Iraqis largely pin the blame on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sena.12330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power-sharing</a> agreement that props up their government and on the obscenely wealthy members of the political elite.</p>

<p>However, Iraq’s struggle with corruption — and specifically public sector corruption — can be traced back to occupation-era reconstruction policies and to Baathist-era patronage. In reconstructing Iraq, the United States scattered unregulated and unmonitored money at many projects and, in the process, unleashed a thirst for graft and easy money at nearly every level of government, and even arguably in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/postwar-development-of-civil-society-in-iraqs-mid-euphrates-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civil society organizations</a>. As the Sudani administration seeks to improve public services and infrastructure to appease disillusioned citizens, it must break the patterns of post-reconstruction corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption and the selective distribution of public services certainly existed prior to the invasion under Saddam Hussein’s regime. In 1968, Iraq’s Baath Party gained control of Iraq through a coup, and subsequently invested <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/From-Developmental-Nationalism-to-the-End-of-in-Bunton/dcc219a70c0bc92b88e12d15f51b84e1a284f1ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily</a> in public service provision fueled by oil revenues. However, the decline in oil revenue in the 1980s, the war with Iran, and economic reform measures greatly <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691180274/state-of-repression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced</a> the Iraqi government’s spending on public services. The 1990 Gulf War and ensuing sanctions further <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199109263251330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decimated</a> state infrastructure, particularly the electric grid and water networks. By the end of the 90s, most Iraqi households did not have consistent access to electricity and rates of malnutrition <a href="https://merip.org/2020/06/the-enduring-lessons-of-the-iraq-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed</a>, especially among children.</p>
<p>In these difficult circumstances, the “Oil-for-Food” program allowed for the sale of Iraqi oil in exchange for humanitarian support. The program was beset by <a href="https://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/files/paul_volckers_final_oilforfood_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive fraud</a> by Iraqi officials, international companies, and United Nations personnel. Within Iraq, Saddam and his circle reaped the majority of benefits from this program and new patterns of corruption emerged during the sanctions period. The massive rise in unemployment spurred an increase in Iraqi bureaucrats <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/29768441.pdf?casa_token=Vuc7K_Ylhd0AAAAA:2F58KFUUFuysZsWCODhvUrb3x8sMGwHmq0GNMgcjErvGNjykRFQCOja5uaaQX1M2X_fx8ZaG25ltFmcnQAdwvs4lMSOaCS254uBUFvRF26uYGXZQiJ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charging</a> for access to public services during the 1990s, a pattern that continues to this day.</p>
<p>However, the influx of aid for reconstruction post-2003 and lack of accountability for contracting and spending brought corruption in Iraq’s public sector to <a href="https://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/374_Iraq_overview_of_corruption_and_anticorruption.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new extremes</a>. The invasion was followed by a large-scale reconstruction effort by the occupying U.S.-led coalition, the new Iraqi government, and a range of international donors. From 2003 to 2014, more than <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/5a53f6dd-84f1-5b4a-a3c9-dfd3364c34f4/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$220 billion</a> was spent on reconstruction alone, including over $74 billion in foreign aid. In addition to violence and the exclusion of Iraqis undermining reconstruction, rebuilding efforts were <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA587236.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hampered</a> by massively wasteful spending and corruption at every level.</p>
<p>A significant number of aid project contractors, Iraqi officials, and U.S. personnel directly engaged in corruption while implementing reconstruction projects. Reports have documented cases of U.S. <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/losangeles/press-releases/2012/two-u.s.-contractor-employees-sentenced-for-kickback-conspiracy-and-tax-crimes-related-to-iraq-reconstruction-efforts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors</a> and <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/u-s-military-personnel-have-been-convicted-of-50-million-worth-of-crimes-in-iraq-and-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personnel</a> committing outright theft of aid and implementing kickback schemes. Both international and domestic contractors were able to reap benefits from aid projects by <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/report-finds-fraud-waste-by-war-contractors-costs-billions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overcharging</a> project fees and engaging in waste and overspending. The U.S. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction report <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2013/sigir-learning-from-iraq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that at least $8 billion of the more than $60 billion for reconstruction was outright wasted.</p>
<p>While gains were <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/5a53f6dd-84f1-5b4a-a3c9-dfd3364c34f4/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> in rehabilitating destroyed or deeply undermined public infrastructure, such as the health system and electric grid, they took place over far longer timelines than initially planned and at far higher costs. Instead, the postwar reconstruction funding surge reinforced the perception that aid projects specifically and public services more broadly could be sources of individual and connection-based profit with little consequence. While many cases of U.S. contractor and personnel fraud were <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2013/sigir-learning-from-iraq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prosecuted</a>, many were likely not due to <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/u-s-official-says-government-wasted-6-8-billion-in-iraq-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor record-keeping</a> by the U.S. government that made knowing the exact extent of fraud and waste impossible. In Iraq, anti-corruption initiatives put in place following the invasion proved to be a weak barrier against government and ministry officials <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarwar-Abdullah-2/publication/321628569_Corruption_protection_fractionalization_and_the_corruption_of_anti-corruption_efforts_in_Iraq_after_2003/links/5b88e96ba6fdcc5f8b734276/Corruption-protection-fractionalization-and-the-corruption-of-anti-corruption-efforts-in-Iraq-after-2003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protecting</a> individuals from accountability based on sect and party membership.</p>

<p>Iraqi officials within the public sector widely solicited bribes in crucial sectors such as health and electricity with limited accountability from either the government or the donors bankrolling public services. While this pattern predated the invasion, it was deeply exacerbated in the post-2003 period with the influx of funding. As Iraq expert Abbas Kadhim wrote in 2010, the U.S.-backed legal <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/40278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system</a> enabled sectarian parties to protect corrupt officials at every level from accountability. Violence against and assassinations of anti-corruption officials <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2013/sigir-learning-from-iraq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proved</a> another deadly challenge. In 2006, for example, Deputy Minister of Health <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/03/04/iraqs-elected-criminals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ammar Al-Saffar</a> was kidnapped and killed by an armed group that controlled the Ministry of Health because of an anti-corruption investigation he was heading.</p>
<p>Key ministries in the post-reconstruction period were staffed on the basis of <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/5a53f6dd-84f1-5b4a-a3c9-dfd3364c34f4/content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political ties</a> rather than competency. As a result, aid-funded reconstruction projects were often mismanaged once completed and handed over to the government. Even many projects highlighted as successes were <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36730781.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> to be nonfunctional or poorly maintained due to both corruption and the exclusion of Iraqis from decisionmaking processes. Over the years, Iraq’s public sector became a tool of patronage with the increase in the number of elite civil servant positions (“<a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/politically-sanctioned-corruption-and-barriers-reform-iraq/04-expansion-special-grades" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special grades</a>”) for party loyalists. This has historical roots — political science research has <a href="https://www.revadhingra.com/research/blog-post-title-one-2nwhb-fmsx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> that in the 1990s, individuals from Saddam’s hometown of Tikrit were employed at higher rates in the public sector compared to the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Twenty years after the war, public services in Iraq remain deeply damaged by patterns of elite corruption <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/corruption-is-strangling-iraq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entrenched</a> in the postwar period. A PLOS study <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that of the approximately 405,000 excess deaths resulting from the war between 2003-11, a third were because of failures of infrastructure such as sanitation, transportation, and health. A recent report by Will Todman and Lubna Yousef from the Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights how political factions <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2023-03/230303_Todman_PoweringRecovery_ArabWorld_0.pdf?VersionId=0BsR66GvXkPKzFrjPirWi7oMWtnew9Pf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> kickbacks from public electricity projects. Already-common electrical outages are worsening, and the majority of Iraqis do not have power for half of the day. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/iraq/what-we-do/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.2 million</a> school-age children do not attend school. Iraq’s public sector was ranked as the 23rd <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/irq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most corrupt</a> in the world in 2022 — an improvement from when it was tied as the <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most</a> in 2006. The situation has prompted protests in recent years, particularly among youth <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iraq/223-iraqs-tishreen-uprising-barricades-ballot-box" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated with corruption’s</a> impacts on public services and the economy.</p>
<p>Today, Iraq has <a href="https://uac-org.org/en/news/details/4697/احتياطات-العراق-الأجنبية-تلامس-115-مليار-دولار" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$115 billion</a> in foreign reserves and the Council of Ministers approved a budget (now pending parliamentary approval) of <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/iraq/2023/03/13/iraq-cabinet-approves-budget-law-after-more-than-a-year-of-political-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$152 billion</a>. These are the highest numbers that Iraq has witnessed in its post-2003 history and represent an opportunity for long-term investment in the country’s infrastructure and public services. However, these numbers also risk inspiring more graft. After all, it was only a few months ago under the Kadhimi administration that $2.5 billion went missing from state-owned banks in what journalists dubbed “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/heist-century-iraq-state-funds-tax-embezzlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the heist of the century</a>.”</p>
<p>What can be reasonably done to protect Iraq’s wealth for its people? Fighting corruption is both a preventive and reactive exercise, and experts have long called for redoubled efforts on anti-corruption initiatives in Iraq. Research from other contexts such as James Loxton’s study of Panama has promoted ideas including the <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-puzzle-of-panamanian-exceptionalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creation</a> of “islands of integrity” that protect key public institutions even amid broader systemic corruption. The Century Foundation’s Sajad Jiyad put forth concrete <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/corruption-is-strangling-iraq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendations</a> including building an anti-corruption network of civil society members and politicians and strengthening domestic institutions such as the Integrity Commission.</p>
<p>Other Iraq analysts have recommended <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/can-new-tech-save-iraq%E2%80%99s-old-economy-183244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transitioning</a> the country away from a cash-based economy. The Sudani administration has started to work on this under pressure from the United States — though the United States was directly involved in setting up Iraq’s banking sector and in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-states-government-iraq-business-0628bad5e4d46315951c90681baba202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizing</a> the dollar auction that later became a money laundering vehicle for neighboring Iran and Turkey. Finally, Iraqi governments have come to view Iraq’s oil wealth as unregulated and political parties and armed groups have actively fought against any regulation. This wealth, which has been used as a tool of patronage in Baathist and post-Baathist Iraq, must be regulated by the Iraqi people if Iraq has any chance of overcoming corruption.</p>
<p>As the popular saying in the Arabic-speaking world goes: “loose money teaches theft.” Iraq post-2003 is a prime example of this. The long-term effects of the flood of money during the reconstruction period were to help establish the public sector as a center of corruption. Understanding the patterns of corruption entrenched during reconstruction is an important part of helping Iraq undertake much-needed public sector reform to build functioning public services for its citizens.</p>

<p>By Tara Varma</p><p>More than one million protestors took to the streets in France on March 24, 2023, in response to President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed pension reforms, which would raise the country’s retirement age from 62 to 64. This was the 10th day of national mobilization <a href="https://fr.euronews.com/2023/01/19/direct-retraites-greve-massive-et-manifestations-en-france" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since</a> January 19, 2023, and the demonstrations show no sign of stopping. After Macron’s government lost its absolute majority in the National Assembly in the 2022 legislative elections — leaving it unable to pass the law through a simple majority — the government decided to use a constitutional tool called Article 49.3, which <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20221013-france-s-article-49-3-a-handy-constitutional-tool-to-bypass-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows</a> it to pass a law in parliament without a vote on the text. The decision resulted in the government facing two votes of no confidence, which it didn’t lose — but the main one, pushed by a centrist minister of parliament, fell short by only nine votes, indicating how <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230321-macron-defiant-as-anger-simmers-over-french-pension-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile</a> the political situation in France is right now. Macron has said that he will not back down, though there is <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/le-mouvement-contre-la-reforme-des-retraites-rappelle-des-souvenirs-aux-anti-cpe-6596614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precedent</a> for the government using Article 49.3 and then later withdrawing the law in response to massive and continuous public protests.</p>

<p>After winning the presidential election last year and beating Marine Le Pen, Macron found himself short of a full majority in the subsequent legislative elections. He has since been struggling with a <a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/legislatives-2022-emmanuel-macron-perd-sa-majorite-face-a-la-nupes-et-percee-historique-du-rn-1660950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relative majority</a>, preventing him from pushing the reform agenda he believes he was elected to implement and forcing him to make deals with different political parties inside the National Assembly.</p>
<p>It is an open question whether the “<a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/commentary_rocking_the_boat_the_macron_method/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macron method</a>” in foreign policy, where he puts forward an initiative and then tries to gather momentum and consensus around it, will be applied to French domestic politics. Macron has long said that “en même temps” (meaning “at the same time” in French) — i.e., working simultaneously on a variety of objectives and overcoming traditional divides — was why he wanted to become president. However, there is a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2023/03/25/emmanuel-macron-de-plus-en-plus-isole_6166930_823448.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">question</a> now of how he can overcome political divides and <em>at the same time</em> present the French population with a comprehensive, inclusive, and participatory solution.</p>
<p>There were questions following the no-confidence votes on whether Macron would keep Élisabeth Borne as prime minister. Macron is adamant that he will, though Borne needs to find a way out of the current impasse. He has now tasked her with a “<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/03/24/french-pm-borne-s-fate-fuels-divisions-among-macron-allies_6020511_7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widening of the presidential majority</a>,” which will certainly entail tilting to the right, as both Macron and Borne have little cachet with left-wing voters.</p>
<p>On March 24, Macron gave a much-expected interview to explain the situation and the way forward. He <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230324-macron-french-government-will-not-yield-to-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that he would not yield to violence and that he was now waiting for the Constitutional Council’s final decision on the reform, which it should announce by the end of April. Macron also committed to working with unions on implementing the pension reform.</p>

<p>Another option on the table — which Macron has rejected, so far — is a dissolution of the National Assembly. If that occurs, <a href="https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/03/26/crise-politique-en-france-quelle-nouvelle-assemblee-en-cas-de-dissolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some projections</a> suggest that the far-right Rassemblement National (National Front) and the left-wing coalition NUPES would receive the two largest shares of the votes, and Macron’s Renaissance would come in third.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign policy, not much change is to be expected, though. France’s constitution lets the foreign policy decisionmaking process rest in the hands of a few individuals. Macron has given the diplomatic cell at the Élysée even more weight in policy setting and policymaking. And, in the face of domestic difficulties, he seems to be following a trend set by his predecessors — focusing his time on foreign policy, which is a “<a href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/fiches/19418-quest-ce-que-le-domaine-reserve-au-president-de-la-republique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domaine reservé</a>,” a field reserved to the national executive.</p>
<p>Macron’s foreign policy agenda will not be affected by the protests. He <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/03/24/macron-and-ursula-von-der-leyen-will-visit-china-to-urge-peace-in-ukraine_6020563_4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is continuing</a> with a planned trip to China, together with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in the beginning of April. If his <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agenda</a> is any indication, he will remain extremely involved in foreign policy in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>France’s current instability might pave the way for populist and nationalist parties’ voting shares to grow further. It is a euphemism to write that the <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/politique/marine-le-pen-et-lukraine-un-soutien-de-facade-ce-que-revelent-les-votes-rn-3MH5RSBKWZCQTPYJRWJHLHWJJQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far-right</a> and the <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2023/03/21/guerre-en-ukraine-lfi-doute-de-l-efficacite-du-mandat-d-arret-international-visant-vladimir-poutine_6166432_823448.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far-left</a> party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) have indicated that they wouldn’t support staunch French support for Ukraine. Although NUPES — a wide-ranging coalition of left-wing parties — shares major domestic policy goals, the parties diverge on foreign policy, particularly as it relates to Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Even if parliament plays a marginal role in foreign policy decisionmaking in France, a new National Assembly could also decide to become more vocal and more vehemently question Paris’ current military, financial, humanitarian, and material support to Ukraine. A major issue in Europe right now is ensuring that European and trans-Atlantic unity on support to Ukraine is not only maintained but reinforced. If France were to weaken its support, that would have very serious consequences for internal European Union cohesion and the future of European security.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the French constitution and the Fifth Republic — which Macron, channeling his inner Charles de Gaulle, interpreted from the beginning in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-skips-consensus-to-govern-like-jupiter-in-raising-frances-retirement-age-760e6535">Jupiterean</a>, top-down way — are now putting the onus on the French president to find an inclusive and constructive way out of the political crisis. Macron needs a change in method so that he can dedicate the remaining four years of his second term to bring about some of the reforms — including the institutional ones — that he promised when he first came to power in 2017.</p>

## #cdata-section
<p>By Vanda Felbab-Brown</p><p>Dear Chairman Luetkemeyer, Ranking Member Beatty, and Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions of the Committee on Financial Services:</p>
<p>Thank you for holding this hearing entitled, “Follow the Money: The CCP’s Business Model Fueling the Fentanyl Crisis.” This is an important issue that deserves the attention of the House Financial Services Committee and its Members. I am honored to have this opportunity to submit this testimony as a statement for the record.</p>

<p>I am a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution where I direct The Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors and co-direct the Africa Security Initiative. Illicit economies, such as the drug trade and wildlife trafficking, organized crime, corruption, and their impacts on U.S. and local security issues around the world are the domain of my work and the subject of several of the books I have written<em>. </em>I have conducted fieldwork on these issues in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In addition to studying China’s and Mexico’s role in various illegal economies over the past two decades, I have been directing over the past three years a new Brookings workstream on China’s role in illegal economies and Chinese criminal groups around the world.</p>
<p>This testimony draws extensively on two detailed reports I published last year: “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/chinas-role-in-the-smuggling-of-synthetic-drugs-and-precursors/">China’s Role in the Smuggling of Synthetic Drugs and Precursors</a>” and “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/chinas-role-in-poaching-and-wildlife-trafficking-in-mexico/">China’s Role in Poaching and Wildlife Trafficking in Mexico</a>.”</p>
<p>The Brookings Institution is a U.S. nonprofit organization devoted to independent research and policy solutions. Its mission is to conduct high-quality, independent research and, based on that research, to provide innovative, practical recommendations for policymakers and the public.  The testimony that I am submitting represents solely my personal views, and does not reflect the views of Brookings, its other scholars, employees, officers, and/or trustees.</p>
<h2><strong>Executive Summary </strong></h2>
<p>The structural characteristics of synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl, including the ease of developing similar, but not scheduled, synthetic drugs and their new precursors — increasingly a wide array of dual-use chemicals — pose immense structural obstacles to controlling their supply.</p>
<p>U.S. domestic prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and law enforcement measures are fundamental and indispensable to countering the devastating fentanyl crisis.</p>
<p>However, given the extent and lethality of the synthetic opioid epidemic in North America and its likely eventual spread to other parts of the world, even supply control measures with partial and limited effectiveness can save lives and thus need to be designed as smartly and robustly as possible.</p>
<p>Three U.S. presidential administrations — those of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden — have devoted diplomatic focus to induce and impel China to tighten its regulations vis-à-vis fentanyl-class drugs and their precursor chemicals and to more diligently enforce these regulations. China, however, sees its counternarcotics enforcement, and more broadly its international law enforcement cooperation, as strategic tools that it can instrumentalize to achieve other objectives. Unlike the U.S. Government, which seeks to delink counternarcotics cooperation with China from the overall bilateral geostrategic relationship, China <em>subordinates</em> its counternarcotics cooperation to its geostrategic relations. As the relationship between the two countries deteriorated, China’s willingness to cooperate with the United States declined. Since 2020, China’s cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics efforts, never high, declined substantially. In August 2022, China officially announced that it suspended all counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>There is little prospect that in the absence of significant warming of the overall U.S.-China bilateral relationship, China will meaningfully intensify its anti-drug cooperation with the United States. U.S. punitive measures, such as sanctions and indictments, are unlikely to change that.</p>
<p>While China takes counternarcotics diplomacy in Southeast Asia and the Pacific very seriously, its operational law enforcement cooperation tends to be highly selective, self-serving, limited, and subordinate to its geopolitical interests. Beijing rarely acts against the top echelons of Chinese criminal syndicates unless they specifically contradict a narrow set of interests of the Chinese Government. Chinese criminal networks provide a variety of services to Chinese legal business enterprises, including those connected to government officials and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>China’s enforcement of precursor and fentanyl analog controls is also complicated by the challenge of systemic corruption in China and the incentive structures within which Chinese officials operate. Chinese Government officials also unofficially extend the umbrella of party protection and government authority to actors who operate in both legal and illegal enterprises as well as to outright criminal groups.</p>
<p>There is little visibility into China’s enforcement of its fentanyl regulations. But in the case of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, small and middle-level actors in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries also appear to be the key perpetrators of regulatory violations and source for Mexican criminal groups. In the case of fentanyl and its precursors, Chinese triads – mafia-like organized crime groups — do not dominate drug production and trafficking.</p>
<p>Chinese actors have come to play an increasing role in laundering money for Mexican cartels, including the principal distributors of fentanyl to the United States — the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). Chinese money laundering brokers mostly manage to circumvent the U.S. and Mexican formal banking systems. Other money laundering and value transfers between Mexican and Chinese criminal networks include trade-based laundering, value transfer utilizing wildlife products, such as protected and unprotected marine products and timber, real estate, cryptocurrencies, casinos, and bulk cash.</p>
<p>The increasing payments for drug precursors originating in China in wildlife products coveted there is particularly noteworthy. This method of payment engenders multiple threats to public health and safety, economic sustainability, food security, and global biodiversity. If this wildlife trafficking spreads dangerous zoonotic diseases, it could even pose a threat to national security.</p>
<p>But this convergence of illicit economies also provides the United States with new opportunities for intelligence gathering and law enforcement actions, even as China-Mexico law enforcement cooperation against the trafficking of fentanyl and precursor agents for meth and synthetic opioids remains minimal.</p>
<p>Mexican drug cartels are expanding their role into crimes against nature, and they are also increasingly infiltrating and seeking to dominate a variety of legal economies in Mexico, including fisheries, logging, and agriculture and extorting an even wider array of legal economies. For example, Mexican organized crime groups, especially the Sinaloa Cartel, seek to monopolize both legal and illegal fisheries along the entire vertical supply chain.</p>
<p>There may also be a growing involvement of Chinese fishing ships in facilitating drug trafficking.</p>
<p>And there is the possibility that Chinese fishing flotillas or individual vessels operating around the Americas and around the world may be equipped with spy equipment for collecting intelligence on behalf of China.</p>
<p>Just like with China, Mexico’s cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics efforts is profoundly hollowed out. The March 2023 crisis in U.S.-Mexico law enforcement cooperation is merely the visible tip of the iceberg of how Mexico has eviscerated counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United States since 2019 and particularly since 2020 when U.S. law enforcement activities in Mexico became shackled and undermined by Mexican Government actions after the U.S. arrest of former Mexican Secretary of Defense Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos.</p>
<p>Because of the diversification of the economic portfolio of Mexican cartels and Chinese criminal networks, to focus primarily on drug seizures close to their source is no longer an adequate approach for effectively countering drug smuggling networks that send pernicious drugs to the United States or their financial systems.</p>
<p>Countering poaching and wildlife trafficking from Mexico and thwarting illegal fishing in Mexican and Latin American waters are increasingly important aspects of countering Mexican drug-trafficking cartels and their damaging effects in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>I submit that to attempt to <strong><em>induce better cooperation from China</em></strong><em>, </em>the United States should:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to emphasize Beijing’s interests in China’s reputation as a global counternarcotics policy leader and leverage multilateral fora to do so;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>continue requesting that China take down websites that illegally sell synthetic opioids to Americans or to Mexican criminal groups;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>strengthen U.S. cooperation with allies and partners to send coordinated messages to push Beijing in preferred directions germane to law enforcement efforts, including greater monitoring and enforcement against sale of precursors chemicals to criminal groups and more robustly and broadly-cast anti-money laundering efforts;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>engage China bilaterally and multilaterally to adopt more robust anti-money laundering standards in its banking and financial systems and trading practices;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>encourage the spread of best practices developed in the China’s pharmaceutical and chemical sectors, including encouraging the industries to adopt self-regulation systems to detect and police suspicious activities, by adopting “know-your-customers” policies, not selling precursors to likely drug traffickers, and alerting law enforcement authorities about such buyers;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>be ready to sanction, including through termination of access to U.S. markets, Chinese firms that violate the best practices protocols and take further actions against those indicted by the U.S. Government;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>develop packages of leverage on prominent Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical industry officials;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>continue developing legal indictment portfolios against Chinese traffickers and their companies, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>incentivize international partners to act seriously against Chinese drug trafficking and criminal networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To attempt to <strong><em>induce better cooperation from Mexico</em></strong><em>, </em>the United States also has new Policy tools to explore.</p>
<p>Designating Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) would enable intelligence gathering and strike options for the United States military, such as against some fentanyl labs in Mexico. But the number of available strike targets in Mexico would be limited and would not robustly disrupt the criminal groups. Nor would the FTO designation add authorities to the economic sanctions and anti-money laundering and financial intelligence tools that the already-in-place designation of Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO) carries.</p>
<p>Moreover, such unilateral U.S. military actions in Mexico would severely jeopardize relations with our vital trading partner and neighbor and the FTO designation could significantly limit and outright hamper U.S. foreign policy options and measures.</p>
<p>Instead, the United States should:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider significantly intensifying border inspections; and</li>
<li>develop packages of leverage, including indictment portfolios, against Mexican national security and law enforcement officials and politicians who undermine and sabotage rule of law cooperation with the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly<em>, </em>to effectively counter the fentanyl-smuggling actors, the United States should <strong><em>expand and smarten up its own measures against criminal actors</em></strong>, including by:</p>
<ul>
<li>truly adopting a whole-of-government approach to countering fentanyl-smuggling entities;</li>

<h2><strong>Key Aspects of China’s Role as Source of Fentanyl and Fentanyl Precursors</strong></h2>
<p>Synthetic opioids are the source of the deadliest and unabating U.S. drug epidemic ever. Since 1999, drug overdoses have killed over 1 million Americans,<sup class="endnote-pointer">1</sup> a lethality rate that has increased significantly since 2012 when synthetic opioids from China began supplying the U.S. demand for illicit opioids. In 2021, the number of fatalities was 106,699;<sup class="endnote-pointer">2</sup> and in 2022, it is estimated at 107,477.<sup class="endnote-pointer">3</sup> Most of the deaths are due to fentanyl, consumed on its own or mixed into fake prescription pills, heroin, and increasingly methamphetamine and cocaine.</p>
<p>Since the Barack Obama administration, the United States has devoted significant diplomatic capital to get China to tighten its regulations vis-à-vis fentanyl-class drugs and to more diligently enforce these regulations.</p>
<p>After years of intense U.S. diplomacy, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the December 2018 G-20 summit that China would place the entire class of synthetic opioids on a regulatory schedule.<sup class="endnote-pointer">4</sup> According to former and current U.S. Government officials and international drug policy and China experts, the U.S. request that China schedule an entire class of drugs that had precipitated the announcement was a significant ask within the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.<sup class="endnote-pointer">5</sup> China had to pass new laws to be able to do so.<sup class="endnote-pointer">6</sup></p>
<p>The United States is the only other major country that has controlled the entire class of fentanyl drugs — in the U.S. case, only on a temporary basis, a decision that the U.S. Congress has yet to make permanent.<sup class="endnote-pointer">7</sup></p>
<p>But even though China placed the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs and two key precursors under a controlled regulatory regime in May 2019, it remains the principal (if indirect) source of U.S. fentanyl. Fentanyl scheduling and China’s adoption of stricter mail monitoring has created some deterrence effects. Instead of finished fentanyl being shipped directly to the United States, most smuggling now takes place via Mexico. Mexican criminal groups source fentanyl, fentanyl precursors, and increasingly pre-precursors from China, and then traffic finished fentanyl from Mexico to the United States. Scheduling of fentanyl and its precursors in China is not sufficient to stem fentanyl flows to the United States.</p>
<p><strong><em>China sees counternarcotics</em></strong> and more broadly international law enforcement cooperation as <strong><em>strategic tool that it can leverage</em></strong> to achieve other objectives. As Beijing’s hopes for prospects of improvements in U.S.-China relations have declined, so too has China’s willingness to coordinate with Washington on counternarcotics objectives.</p>
<p>The United States blames China for poor domestic enforcement of its regulations, inadequate actions against Chinese drug smugglers and money launderers, and insufficient regulatory oversight of its non-scheduled chemicals. Highlighting that it does not have any fentanyl abuse problem and thus that its regulatory actions are motivated purely to help the United States, China rejects Washington’s claims and blames the opioid epidemic solely on America’s internal failings. The extent of counternarcotics cooperation — or its absence — remains determined by the state of the U.S.-China overall geopolitical relationship, which has deteriorated over the past decade and shows few prospects for improvement. Thus, the hope that despite the geopolitical rivalry, counternarcotics could prove a domain of U.S.-China cooperation has not yet materialized.</p>
<p>There is <strong><em>little visibility into China’s enforcement of its fentanyl regulations</em></strong>, but China’s enforcement likely remains limited. U.S.-China counternarcotics cooperation remains fraught, and from the U.S. perspective deeply inadequate. Rejecting U.S. blame of China for the opioid epidemic and emphasizing U.S. responsibilities for that calamity, Beijing used to point to its “benevolence” in anti-drug cooperation.<sup class="endnote-pointer">8</sup> However, China’s willingness to act on U.S.-provided intelligence to counter Chinese fentanyl- and fentanyl-precursor smuggling rings has been long limited and has significantly tapered off since 2019.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<p>The enforcement of precursor and fentanyl analog controls is also complicated by with the challenge of <strong><em>systemic corruption in China and the incentive structures within which Chinese officials operate</em></strong>. Even with President Xi’s intensive anti-corruption efforts,<sup class="endnote-pointer">9</sup> designed mainly to consolidate his own power, eliminate independent sources of influence, and improve the image of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), many mid-level and senior CCP officials remain rent-seeking, with their bureaucratic and power advancement still linked principally to job creation and economic growth in their jurisdictions, even if those objectives are accomplished through means that are illegal or problematic.<sup class="endnote-pointer">10</sup> Given the political power of China’s chemical and pharmaceutical industries and the extent of tax revenue and jobs they generate, many Chinese officials are reluctant to monitor, investigate, prosecute, or otherwise cross significant industry players. Small and middle-level actors are more likely to become targets if and when enforcement action is taken.</p>
<p>But in the case of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, <strong><em>small and middle-level actors</em></strong> in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries also appear to be <strong><em>the key perpetrators</em></strong> of regulatory violations and source for Mexican criminal groups. Moreover, given that fentanyl is a very small source of earnings for China’s chemical industry, powerful Chinese industry actors have little interest in protecting fentanyl and fentanyl precursor production, beyond simply seeking to minimize any oversight into their production and business practices.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"></a>Informally, Chinese Government officials have long become accustomed to unofficially extending the <strong><em>umbrella of party protection and government authority to actors who operate in both legal and illegal enterprises as well as to outright criminal groups</em></strong>.<sup class="endnote-pointer">11</sup> The frequent appointments of former party officials to business boards could facilitate monitoring and oversight, but frequently enables this unofficial protection and facilitates corruption. However, this clear pattern of behavior is not centrally organized, systemically endorsed, or openly tolerated behavior. It has also been weakened by Xi’s post-2012 anti-corruption drives.<sup class="endnote-pointer">12</sup> Even so, a seemingly very dominant and all-powerful state is riddled with “bureaucratic slack,” enforcement inefficiencies, and a proclivity to seek legal and bureaucratic loopholes. Moreover, different provinces often develop distinct forms of illegal bureaucratic protection, complicating uniform, systemic, and efficient application of rule of law.<sup class="endnote-pointer">13</sup></p>
<p>Overall, as with other countries such as Australia, <strong><em>China subordinates its counternarcotics cooperation to the geostrategic relationship with the United States.</em></strong> As the relationship between the two countries deteriorated, China’s willingness to cooperate with the United States declined. There is little prospect that in the absence of significant warming of the overall U.S.-China bilateral relationship, China would significantly intensify its anti-drug cooperation with the United States. U.S. punitive measures, such as sanctions and drug indictments, are unlikely to change that.</p>
<p>The evolution of China’s posture toward illicit methamphetamine production in China and the trafficking of meth precursors from China provides important insights into the patterns and limitations of China’s international law enforcement cooperation. As with fentanyl precursors, China emphasizes that it cannot act against nonscheduled substances.</p>
<p>China takes counternarcotics diplomacy in Southeast Asia and the Pacific very seriously, but its <strong><em>operational law enforcement cooperation tends to be highly selective, self-serving, limited, and subordinated to its geopolitical interests.</em></strong></p>
<p>Nonetheless, after years of refuting international criticism for its role in methamphetamine precursor smuggling amid burgeoning meth production in Asia, China has intensified its regional law enforcement cooperation at least with some countries. It has also mounted stronger internal regulatory measures even for nonscheduled drugs and has undertaken monitoring and interdiction operations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Yet Beijing rarely acts against the top echelons of Chinese criminal syndicates unless they specifically contradict a narrow set of interests of the Chinese Government.</em></strong> Chinese criminal groups cultivate political capital with Chinese authorities and government officials abroad by also promoting China’s political, strategic, and economic interests.</p>
<p>The intermeshing and mergers between Chinese legal and illegal economic enterprises across the Southeast Asia significantly takes places in Special Economic Zones in Southeast Asia, such as the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in northern Laos near the border with Myanmar and Thailand. Various U.S. and regional law enforcement officials and international drug policy experts believe that the presence of Chinese and regional organized crime groups in the many of the Mekong region’s at least 74 SEZs<sup class="endnote-pointer">14</sup> is large and that the SEZs feature extensive illegal economies, such as drug, wildlife, and human trafficking.<sup class="endnote-pointer">15</sup> Yet it does not appear that the Chinese Government has exhibited interest in cooperating with authorities in those countries in sharing intelligence or acting against Chinese nationals in China implicated in likely criminality in the SEZs.<sup class="endnote-pointer">16</sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, <strong><em>in the case of fentanyl and its precursors, Chinese triads </em></strong>—<strong><em> mafia-like organized crime groups </em></strong>—<strong><em> do not dominate drug production and trafficking.</em></strong> The trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors is conducted by a wide panoply of Chinese criminal actors, from small family-based and specialized groups to businesses that also conduct highly diverse legal trade with organized crime groups. Fentanyl and fentanyl-precursor trafficking from China does exist in stark contrast to methamphetamine trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region which is thoroughly controlled and dominated by the Chinese triads.</p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Western Hemisphere, Mexican drug trafficking groups, especially the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG,</em></strong> dominate the trafficking and wholesale distribution of fentanyl and methamphetamine into the United States. They have become the principal buyers of finished fentanyl from China and India as well as fentanyl precursors and pre-precursors from both countries. Increasingly, the precursor and pre-precursor trade is the method in which the illicit transactions between China and Mexico take place,<sup class="endnote-pointer">17</sup> with fentanyl produced from the precursors and pre-precursors in Mexico.</p>
<p>The triads’ franchise-like network organization enhances the groups’ resilience and allows them to absorb considerable financial losses resulting from seizures without bankrupting the groups. The ease of production and smuggling of synthetic drugs further enhance this resilience.</p>
<p>Many of the Chinese smuggling networks are connected in complex ways to legal Chinese businesses. Indeed, the growth of their power in the second half of the 20th century is deeply connected to the growth of China’s legal economy from the late 1970s onward. After their destruction during Mao’s era, the triads in southern China resurrected themselves on the coattails of the growth of China’s legal economy and businesses. But as an expert of Chinese organized crime groups put it, “it is really the synthetic drugs revolution that brought bags of money back to the triads and put a spring into their step.”<sup class="endnote-pointer">18</sup></p>
<p>The triads’ connections to China’s legal economy and enterprises remain significant and essential. Like many criminal groups around the world, the triads use legal businesses as fronts for their illegal operations and money-laundering, and they plug into the infrastructure and transportation networks of legal businesses. But <strong><em>they also provide a variety of services to Chinese legal business enterprises, including those connected to government officials and the CCP,</em></strong> such as in the promotion and facilitation of Chinese businesses abroad, the building up of networks of political influence for China abroad, and the informal information gathering and enforcement against Chinese fugitives and Chinese diaspora outside of China, such as to prevent criticism of the regime.</p>
<p><strong><em>China-Mexico law enforcement cooperation</em></strong> against the trafficking of fentanyl and precursor agents for meth and synthetic opioids remains minimal. As with the United States, China rejects co-responsibility and emphasizes that controls and enforcement are matters for Mexico’s own customs authorities and other Mexican law enforcement to address. China has maintained this posture even as the presence of Chinese criminal actors in Mexico, including in money laundering and illicit value transfers (which increasingly feature barter of wildlife products for synthetic drug precursors) are expanding rapidly.</p>
<h2><strong>Money Laundering by Chinese Actors and Value Transfer through Wildlife Trade and Trafficking</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Chinese actors</em></strong> <strong><em>have come to play an increasing role in laundering money for Mexican cartels</em></strong> and criminal groups across Latin America (as well as Europe) by using Chinese businesses located in Mexico, the United States, and China, and Chinese informal money transfer systems.<sup class="endnote-pointer">19</sup> These informal systems emerged in an effort to avoid banking fees and scrutiny and China’s capital flight controls: China’s laws allow Chinese citizens to move only $50,000 from China abroad per year.</p>
<p>Drug trafficking groups, including in Latin America, are in turn flush with vast sums of hard cash, such as euros and dollars, sought after in China. The National Drug Intelligence Center of the U.S. Department of Justice estimated in 2008 that Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking groups earned between $18 billion and $39 billion a year from wholesale drug sales.<sup class="endnote-pointer">20</sup> In 2010, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated bulk cash smuggling to Mexico at between $19 billion and $29 billion annually.<sup class="endnote-pointer">21</sup> Other estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, research organizations, and news media have assessed Mexico’s drug export revenues to have been in the range of $6 billion to $21 billion a year between 2010 and 2018.<sup class="endnote-pointer">22</sup></p>
<p>Although it is not clear what percentage of the cartels’ illicit profits is laundered through Chinese money transfer networks, U.S. officials fear that the effectiveness of the Chinese networks’ money laundering is such that it is even displacing established Mexican and Colombian money launderers and putting the flows of cartel money even more out of reach of U.S. law enforcement.<sup class="endnote-pointer">23</sup> Chinese operators heavily tax Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China, and are thus able to tax the drug cartels lightly and undercut other money launderers.<sup class="endnote-pointer">24</sup> In some cases, a particular Chinese money laundering network managed to get itself hired by both the Sinaloa Cartel and the CJNG; in other cases, they worked exclusively with just one of them.<sup class="endnote-pointer">25</sup></p>
<p>As described in detail in Drazen Jorgic’s Reuters special report,<sup class="endnote-pointer">26</sup> <strong><em>the Chinese brokers mostly manage to bypass the U.S. and Mexican formal banking systems</em></strong>, thus evading anti-money laundering measures and simplifying one of the biggest challenges for the cartels, namely moving large amount of bulk money subject to law enforcement detection. The only interface with the formal banking system takes place in China, into which U.S. law enforcement agencies have little-to-no visibility. Using encrypted platforms, burner phones, and codes, cartel representatives hand over bulk cash to Chinese contacts. The contact brings the money to U.S.-based Chinese businesses with bank accounts in China, and via a phone app from that account transfer the yuan equivalent to other accounts in China, bypassing U.S. bank fees and scrutiny. Chinese money launderers then perform similar “mirror transactions” to convert the money into pesos, utilizing Chinese businesses with Mexican bank accounts.</p>

<p>U.S. investigations and court cases revealed that the Bank of China was among the Chinese financial firms utilized by Chinese operators to launder the money of Mexican cartels.<sup class="endnote-pointer">27</sup> In the investigations of the role of Chinese money laundering networks for Mexican cartels, U.S. officials have often been frustrated with the lack of cooperation from Chinese officials. Chinese officials have, however, emphasized that China is ready and willing to “destroy drug cartels and drug-related money laundering networks” and cooperate with the U.S. on the “principle of respecting each other’s laws, equality, and mutual benefit,” adding that the U.S. anti-money laundering requests focused on “legitimate enterprises and individuals” in China without the United States providing evidence of their criminal and drug involvement.<sup class="endnote-pointer">28</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Other money laundering and value transfers between Mexican and Chinese criminal networks include trade-based laundering, value transfer utilizing wildlife products</em></strong>, such as protected and unprotected marine products and timber, real estate, cryptocurrencies, casinos, and bulk cash — though it is not clear what percentage of laundering any of these methods account for.<sup class="endnote-pointer">29</sup> An example of trade-based laundering includes Chinese launderers for CJNG buying shoes in China and reselling them in Mexico to give the cartel the necessary cash.<sup class="endnote-pointer">30</sup> The casino laundering takes place in ways similar to the informal money transfers: Bulk cash is brought to a casino in Vancouver, for example, where the cartel-linked individual loses it while his money laundering associate in Macau wins and pays the Chinese precursor smuggling networks.<sup class="endnote-pointer">31</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The increasing payments for drug precursors in wildlife products coveted in China</em></strong> — for Traditional Chinese Medicine, aphrodisiacs, other forms of consumption, or as a tool of speculation, such as in the case of the highly prized swim bladder of the endemic and protected Mexican totoaba fish poached for Chinese markets — constitute yet other method of illicit value transfer.<sup class="endnote-pointer">32</sup> Other wildlife commodities used for money laundering, tax evasion, and as barter payments between Mexican cartels and Chinese precursor networks include abalone, jellyfish, and lobster.<sup class="endnote-pointer">33</sup> Instead of paying in cash, Chinese traffickers are paid in commodities. The amount of value generated by wildlife commodity payments, likely in the tens of millions of dollars, may not cover all of the precursor payment totals, though the latter likely also amount to tens of millions of dollars.<sup class="endnote-pointer">34</sup> Wildlife barter may not displace other methods of money laundering and value transfer. But <strong><em>the increasing role of this method can devastate natural ecosystems and biodiversity in Mexico </em></strong>as the cartels steadily seek to legally and illegally harvest more and more of a wider range of animal and plant species to pay for drug precursors.</p>
<p>The connections between the illegal drug trade and the timber and wildlife trade and trafficking from Mexico to China are all the more significant as poaching and wildlife trafficking in Mexico is increasing and <strong><em>Mexican drug cartels are expanding their role in crimes against nature</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>They are also increasingly taking over legal economies in Mexico,</em></strong> including logging, fisheries, and various agricultural products such as avocados, citrus, and corn in parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>Wildlife trafficking from Mexico to China receives little international attention, but it is growing, compounding the threats to Mexican biodiversity posed by preexisting poaching for other markets, including the United States. Since <strong><em>Mexican criminal groups often control extensive territories in Mexico which become no-go-zones for government officials and environmental defenders</em></strong>, visibility into the extent of poaching, illegal logging, and wildlife trafficking in Mexico is limited. It is likely, however, that the extent of poaching and trafficking, including to China, is more pervasive and widespread than commonly understood or even considered. Poaching and wildlife trafficking can rapidly deplete this biodiversity.</p>
<p>Terrestrial and marine species, as well as timber, illegally harvested in Mexico for Chinese markets increasingly threaten Mexico’s biodiversity, that accounts for some 12 percent of the world’s biodiversity. Among the species poached in Mexico and smuggled to China, sometimes via the United States, are reptiles, sea cucumbers, totoaba, abalone, sharks, and increasingly also likely jaguars as well as various species of rosewood.</p>
<p>Legal wildlife trade from Mexico to China, such as in sea cucumbers and crocodilian skins, provides cover for laundering poached animals. Illegal fishing accounts for a staggering proportion of Mexico’s fish production, but even the legitimate fishing and export industry provides a means to channel illegally-caught marine products to China.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Mexico, far more so than in other parts of the world, poaching and wildlife trafficking for Chinese markets is increasingly thickly intermeshed with drug trafficking, money laundering, and value transfer in illicit economies</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Organized crime groups across Mexico, especially the Sinaloa Cartel, seek to monopolize both legal and illegal fisheries along the entire vertical supply chain</em></strong>. Beyond merely demanding a part of the profits, they dictate to legal and illegal fishers how much the fishers can fish, insisting that the fishers sell the harvest only to the criminal groups, and that restaurants, including those catering to international tourists, buy fish only from the criminal groups. Mexican organized crime groups set the prices at which fishers can be compensated and restaurants paid for the cartels’ marine products. The criminal groups also force processing plants to process the fish brought in by the criminal groups and issue it with fake certificates of legal provenance for export into the United States and China. And they charge extortion fees to seafood exporters.</p>
<p>This takeover of the fisheries by Mexican criminal groups puts Chinese traders further into direct contact with them and alters the relationship patterns. Whereas 10 to 15 years half ago, Chinese traders in legal wildlife commodities and illegal wildlife products dealt directly with local hunters, poachers, and fishermen, increasingly Mexican organized crime groups forcibly inserted themselves as middlemen, dictating that producers need to sell to them and that they themselves will sell to the Chinese traders and traffickers who move the product from Mexico’s borders to China.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mexican criminal groups are also expanding into illegal fishing outside of Mexico</em></strong>. For example, when the overharvesting of sea cucumber in Yucatán, Mexico for markets in China tapered off as a result of the sea cucumber population crash, Mexican organized crime groups that operate in Yucatán started bringing to their seafood collection hubs fish illegally caught in Costa Rica and elsewhere in Latin America.<sup class="endnote-pointer">35</sup> Yucatán is also an important hub for cocaine trafficking.</p>
<p>There have long been suspicions about the <strong><em>extent to which Latin American fishing fleets are also engaged in the smuggling of drugs </em></strong>such as cocaine to the United States.<sup class="endnote-pointer">36</sup> The penetration of legal fisheries by Mexican cartels further facilitates their drug smuggling enterprise.</p>
<p>Similarly, massive Chinese fishing fleets have long engaged in illegal fishing, sometimes devastating marine resources in other countries’ exclusive economic zones. However, there also <strong><em>appears to be a growing involvement of Chinese fishing ships in drug trafficking,</em></strong> compounding the extensive problem of Chinese cargo vessels carrying contraband such as drugs and their precursors as well as wildlife.<sup class="endnote-pointer">37</sup></p>
<p>And there is the possibility that Chinese fishing flotillas or individual vessels operating around the Americas and elsewhere in the world may carry spy equipment collection intelligence for China.</p>
<p>As in illegal logging in Mexico, <strong><em>the interest of Chinese traders in an animal or plant species and efforts to source them in Mexico on a substantial scale for Chinese markets attract the attention of Mexican criminal groups</em></strong>. <strong><em>The Chinese Government, for the most part, rejects China’s responsibility for poaching and wildlife trafficking in Mexico and insists that these problems are rather for the Mexican Government to solve</em></strong>. Prevention and enforcement cooperation has been minimal and sporadic. The Chinese Government has not been keen to formalize either China-Mexico or China-Mexico-United States cooperation against wildlife trafficking, preferring informal case-by-case cooperation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, under intense international pressure, the Chinese Government moved beyond seizures of the totoaba swim bladder smuggled to China from Mexico and in 2018 mounted several interdiction raids against retail markets. These raids ended the openly-visible and blatant sales of illegal wildlife commodities. Such retail sales moved behind closed doors and onto private online platforms. But it does not appear that China has sustained efforts to counter the now-more hidden illegal retail and has mounted raids against clandestine sales.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mexican environmental protection regulations and enforcement agencies have been weakened by actions of the Andrés Manuel López Obrador administration</em></strong>, even as Mexican natural resources are increasingly under threat from organized crime and wildlife traffickers. Mexican environmental agencies lack mandates, personnel, and equipment to prevent and stop environmental crime. Government officials, legal traders in wildlife commodities, and even law enforcement agencies in Mexico are systematically corrupted and intimidated by organized crime and the poor rule of law environment facilitates poaching, illegal logging, and wildlife trafficking to China.</p>
<p><strong><em>Preventing far greater damage to Mexico’s biodiversity from illegal harvesting and poaching and wildlife and timber trafficking requires urgent attention in Mexico with far more dedicated and potent resources, as well as meaningful international cooperation</em></strong>, to identify and dismantle smuggling networks and retail markets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Importantly, countering poaching and wildlife trafficking from Mexico and acting against illegal fishing off Mexico and around Latin America is increasingly an important element in countering Mexican drug-trafficking cartels.</em></strong> They have diversified their business portfolios into various other forms of illegal trade beyond as well as into legal economies. <strong><em>Primarily focusing on drug seizures close to their source is no longer sufficient to effectively counter their networks or finances.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Collapse of China’s and Mexico’s Cooperation with U.S. Counternarcotics Efforts</strong></h2>
<p>Even for U.S. and international law enforcement and drug policy officials, let alone drug policy experts, there is limited visibility into China’s internal law enforcement actions. This lack of visibility has only intensified since January 2020 when China became the focus of a negative international spotlight due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, China reduced and even stopped sharing information about how many inspections of pharmaceutical companies it undertook, how many anti-fentanyl and anti-precursor raids it conducted within China, and how many Chinese nationals authorities apprehended or indicted on fentanyl or precursor trafficking charges.<sup class="endnote-pointer">38</sup></p>
<p>The most prominent case of prosecution and sentencing of fentanyl traffickers in China resulted in the conviction of nine Chinese nationals for drug trafficking in Hebei province. In 2017, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) provided their Chinese counterparts with its intelligence that led to the arrests.<sup class="endnote-pointer">39</sup> U.S. officials were invited to the sentencing. The case remains perhaps the high mark of U.S.-China counternarcotics cooperation. But it took place when Beijing was still hoping that an improvement in U.S.-China relations was possible and saw counternarcotics cooperation as a mechanism to obtain it. As Beijing’s perception of the likelihood of any improvement in relations has eroded, so too has its willingness to explore coordination on counternarcotics issues.</p>
<p>It does not appear that other high-profile prosecutions have taken place in China since. There also do not appear to be cases of Chinese law enforcement officials prosecuting other individual companies or traders for violations of the May 2019 regulation. However, it is difficult to make assessments of China’s internal law enforcement actions as China has become a black hole for visibility into its internal law enforcement actions.<sup class="endnote-pointer">40</sup> That said, after years of U.S. requests, China finally agreed to allow the DEA to open an office in Shanghai, somewhat expanding access for U.S. law enforcement agents in the country.<sup class="endnote-pointer">41</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Worrisomely, since the 2017 collaboration, Beijing has not followed up on other major U.S. indictments of Chinese nationals on drug trafficking charges.</em></strong> Consequently, in August 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the Zheng Cartel, its leader Fujing Zheng, and his father Guanghua Zheng as violators of the Kingpin Act. In July 2020, Treasury added four other cartel operatives and the Global United Biotechnology Inc. (a storefront for the Cartel) to the designation.<sup class="endnote-pointer">42</sup> With operations in Mexico and cover companies including veterinary care, computer and other retail, and chemical companies, the cartel has been manufacturing and selling fentanyl and other drugs to the United States and 24 other countries. But Chinese authorities have not moved against the indicted individuals who remain at large.</p>
<p>After the visit of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022<em>, China<strong> officially announced that it suspended all of its counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United States.<sup class="endnote-pointer">43</sup></strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Just like with China, Mexico’s cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics efforts is profoundly hollowed out.</em></strong> In recent weeks, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has taken to falsely denying that fentanyl is produced in Mexico, deceptive statements echoed at his behest by other high-level Mexican officials and agencies.<sup class="endnote-pointer">44</sup> Blaming fentanyl <em>use</em> in the United States on U.S. moral and social decay, including American families not hugging their children enough (the statement an apparent nod to his strategy of confronting Mexican criminals with “hugs and not bullets”), the Mexican President also proceeded to deny that fentanyl is increasingly consumed in Mexico.<sup class="endnote-pointer">45</sup> With his statements, President López Obrador is not just unwittingly (or knowingly) echoing China’s rhetoric, but also publicly dismissing two decades of a policy of shared responsibility for drug production, trafficking, and consumption between United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>But this <strong><em>latest crisis is merely the visible tip of the iceberg of how Mexico has eviscerated counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United States during the López Obrador administration.</em></strong> When President López Obrador assumed office in December 2018, he started systematically weakening that collaboration. From the beginning of his administration, he has sought to withdraw from the Merida Initiative, the U.S.-Mexico security collaboration framework signed during the Felipe Calderón administration. And he sought to redefine the collaboration extremely narrowly as merely U.S. assistance to Mexico in reducing demand for drugs in Mexico while the United States focused on stopping the flow of drug proceeds and weapons to Mexico and reducing demand at home. Previous Mexican governments also certainly sought a significant increase in U.S. law enforcement focus on those two types of illicit flows, but were willing to collaborate also inside Mexico.</p>
<p>After the United States arrested former Mexican Secretary of Defense Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos in October 2020 for cooperation with a vicious Mexican drug cartel, President López Obrador threatened to end all cooperation and expel from Mexico all U.S. law enforcement personnel.<sup class="endnote-pointer">46</sup> To avoid that outcome, the Trump administration handed Gen. Cienfuegos over to Mexico where he was rapidly acquitted.</p>
<p>But despite this significant U.S. concession, Mexico’s counternarcotics cooperation remained limited. Meanwhile, <strong><em>U.S. law enforcement activities in Mexico became shackled and undermined</em></strong> by a December 2021 Mexican national security law on foreign agents.<sup class="endnote-pointer">47</sup> As a former high-level Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official Matthew Donahue stated, since then and because of the continually immense level of corruption and cartel infiltration in Mexican security agencies, Mexican law enforcement spends more time surveilling DEA agents than it does cartel members.<sup class="endnote-pointer">48</sup></p>
<p>With the threat of Mexico’s unilateral withdrawal from the Merida Initiative, the United States government worked hard to negotiate a new security framework with Mexico — The U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities<sup class="endnote-pointer">49</sup> — in the fall of 2021. The United States emphasized the public health and anti-money-laundering elements of the agreement, as the Mexican government sought. The Framework reiterates multiple dimensions of counternarcotics cooperation, including law enforcement.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the Mexican government actions and cooperations on its side of the U.S.-Mexico border remain profoundly inadequate, including and particularly in law enforcement actions to counter the Mexican criminal groups and their production and trafficking of fentanyl.</p>
<p><strong><em>The U.S.-Mexico law enforcement cooperation has thus been only limping.</em></strong> The Mexican government has conducted some interdiction operations based on U.S. intelligence, and some collaboration has persisted at the sub-federal level in Mexico. While the DEA operations in Mexico remain hampered and limited, other U.S. law enforcement actors in Mexico have been able to induce some cooperation, with some Mexican government agencies even sharing some intelligence with the United States.</p>
<p>Crucially, as DEA Administrator Anne Milgram stated in her recent Senate testimony,<sup class="endnote-pointer">50</sup> the Mexican government continues to be unwilling to share samples and information from its claimed lab busts and fentanyl and fentanyl precursor seizures. It is still not allowing the participation of DEA agents, even in only an observer role, in the interdiction operations it claims it has conducted. Extraditions of indicted drug traffickers to the United States from Mexico also remain limited.</p>
<p><strong><em>There is no doubt that Mexico’s law enforcement cooperation with the United States has dramatically weakened and is troublingly inadequate. </em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusions and Policy Implications and Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>As vast numbers of Americans are dying of fentanyl overdose and Chinese and Mexican criminal groups expand their operations around the world and into a vast array of illegal and legal economies, the United States finds itself in hollowed out and weak cooperation with both China and Mexico. Below I offer some policy implications and recommendations on how the United States can attempt to induce China and Mexico to better cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics and law enforcement objectives. I also provide suggestions for what law enforcement and policy measures the United States can undertake independently, and even if Mexico and China continue to reject robust cooperation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Structural characteristics of synthetic drugs</em></strong>, including the ease of developing similar, but not scheduled synthetic drugs and their new precursors — increasingly a wide array of dual-use chemicals — <strong><em>pose immense structural obstacles to controlling supply</em></strong>, irrespective of political will to prohibit and regulate their use and enforce the regulations. These structural characteristics impose large limitations on supply-side control effectiveness even if China were to radically alter its posture toward counternarcotics cooperation against Chinese drug trafficking networks and start robustly engaging in supply control measures toward synthetic opioids, methamphetamine, and their precursors originating in China with the United States and other countries.</p>
<p><strong><em>U.S. domestic prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and law enforcement measures remain indispensable and fundamental</em></strong> for countering the devastating fentanyl crisis. It is likely that the most powerful measures to address the opioid crisis are internal policies such as expanded treatment and supervised use.</p>
<p>However, given the extent and lethality of the synthetic opioid epidemic in North America and its likely spread in time to other parts of the world, <strong><em>even supply control measures with partial and limited effectiveness can save lives.</em></strong> That is a worthwhile objective. The Commission on Combatting Illicit Opioid Trafficking stressed that targeted supply reduction and the enforcement of current laws and regulations are essential to disrupting the availability of chemicals needed to manufacture synthetic opioids.<sup class="endnote-pointer">51</sup> The Commission also highlighted how improved oversight of large chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and enhanced investigations of vendors or importers in key foreign countries can help disrupt the flow.<sup class="endnote-pointer">52</sup> The Report’s supply-side control recommendations include reducing online advertising; encouraging enhanced anti-money laundering efforts in China and Mexico; enhanced interdiction efforts; increased international scheduling of at least  synthetic drug precursors that are only used for illicit purposes and enhanced control of precursor flows through collaboration with China and international counternarcotics organizations.<sup class="endnote-pointer">53</sup></p>
<p>My recommendations below focus on how to get China to accept such enhanced controls as well as highlight the difficult constraints on shaping China’s behavior toward such desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Yet the effectiveness of all U.S. policy actions vis-à-vis China will be limited by the fact that China subordinates its counternarcotics cooperation with the United States to the overall geopolitical relationships between the two countries and, unlike the United States, refuses to delink it: Without a significant improvement in the geopolitical relationship, there is little prospect of China’s increasing its law enforcement actions against fentanyl and cooperating more robustly with the United States. The greater the rivalry and tensions, the less cooperation China will deliver.</p>
<p>Even so and beyond the direct goal of preventing drug misuse and overdose in the United States and around the world, the United States also has broad global order objectives in its attempt to motivate China to share responsibility for illicit economies in which Chinese actors play a prominent role and for reducing the impunity of Chinese criminal networks, meaningfully sharing intelligence, acting on international indictments, and fostering rule of law at home and abroad.</p>
<p>My recommendations below also analyze and recommend tools to induce Mexico to cooperate more robustly with U.S. law enforcement measures.</p>
<p>U.S. counternarcotics and law enforcement <strong>bargaining with Mexico is also constrained by the U.S. reliance on Mexico to stop migrant flows to the United States</strong>.  If the United States were able to conduct a comprehensive immigration reform that would provide legal work opportunities to those currently seeking protection and opportunities in the United States through unauthorized migration, it would have far better leverage to induce meaningful and robust counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with Mexico and would be better able to save U.S. lives. Nonetheless, even absent such reform, the United States can take impactful measures that I discuss below.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Inducing Cooperation from China</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>With the Chinese government, Washington can continue to emphasize Beijing’s interests in China’s reputation as a global counternarcotics policy leader</em> and <em>leverage multilateral fora</em> such the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Narcotics Control Board. The United States should also continue to emphasize China’s <em>self-interest</em> in preventing the emergence of a devasting synthetic opioid epidemic in the country as the prescription of opioids in China grows, even though Beijing has thus far been dismissive of these concerns. And <em>Washington should continue requesting that China take down websites that sell synthetic opioids illegally to Americans or to Mexican criminal groups.</em></p>
<p><em>The United States should also strengthen its cooperation with allies and partners</em>, such as Australia and Europe, to s<em>end coordinated messages to push Beijing in preferred directions</em> of law enforcement efforts, including greater monitoring and enforcement against sales of precursors chemicals to criminal groups and more robust and broadly-cast anti-money laundering efforts. Such coordinated messages will <em>raise reputation costs for China of its law enforcement inactions</em>. There is reason to believe that such coordination among the U.S. and allies as well as regional partners in Asia-Pacific could result in greater Chinese willingness for and diligence in law enforcement collaboration. In other cases where China came to be faced with sustained criticism from countries with which it sought to cultivate influence, such as in Southeast Asian regarding meth precursors or globally regarding ivory trafficking, Beijing has over time altered its stance and adopted more cooperative and accommodating policies.</p>
<p><em>The United States should continue to engage China bilaterally and multilaterally to adopt more robust anti-money laundering standards</em> in its banking and financial systems and trading practices. Getting China to adopt such more stringent regulatory measures will take considerable time. Meanwhile, China may occasionally be incentivized by the United States to use anti-money laundering measures against particular trafficking networks or chemical companies who are clearly selling precursors to drug traffickers, such as in Mexico. But beyond sporadic actions, there is little likelihood that China will rapidly alter its anti-money laundering stance away from selective focus on Chinese capital flight and toward broader counternarcotics measures. Nor is there high likelihood that any time soon China would allow the U.S. or other countries greater visibility into its banking and financial systems, since it will continue to seek to obfuscate the many problems of both. However, in time, U.S. and multilateral support for China’s implementation of more robust anti-money laundering measures could produce <em>some</em> positive counternarcotics outcomes. There is no evidence to suggest that even stringent anti-money laundering measures would end or significantly reduce the supply of fentanyl to the United States. However, anti-money laundering cooperation could at least help dismantle smuggling networks and perhaps also deter some, thus making it more difficult for the networks to operate. At minimum, it would reduce their ability to operate with wide impunity and to strengthen the enforcement of the rule of law.</p>
<p><em>With</em> <em>the</em> <em>Chinese government and</em> <em>Chinese pharmaceutical companies</em>, the United States could encourage the spread of best practices developed in the pharmaceutical sector. Over time, Chinese pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to adopt the full array of global control standards, including the development of better training, certification, and inspection.</p>
<p>Even so, the shift toward precursors and pre-precursors with widespread dual use poses massive structural obstacles to control. The United States should remain deeply engaged in a global discussion on how to develop enhanced special surveillance lists and monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for dual-use chemicals, as those that are not scheduled do not have to be declared in exports.</p>
<p>With no global industry and countries’ willingness to move toward scheduling many dual-use chemicals, the United States should be <em>encouraging the industry to adopt self-regulation systems to detect and police suspicious activities, by adopting know-your-customers policies,</em> not selling precursors to likely drug traffickers, and alerting law enforcement authorities about such buyers.</p>
<p>But even in the banking sector, such post-September 11 know-your-customer, due-diligence policies, and reams of reports of suspicious activities, had limited impact while generating problematic side-effects.<sup class="endnote-pointer">54</sup> In comparison with banking, the global chemical industry is far larger and more fragmented, comprised of hundreds of thousands of firms and millions of facilities, including not merely producers but also many brokers. So achieving widespread and diligent adoption of self-regulation and incentivizing it through the punishment of violators is highly challenging. Moreover, in various parts of the world, including China and India, criminal groups have deeply infiltrated the chemical industry,<sup class="endnote-pointer">55</sup> making it easy for them to falsify and subvert such self-regulation measures. Reducing criminal infiltration into and corruption within the pharmaceutical sectors in both countries would be necessary to make such measures more effective.</p>
<p>Moreover, these types of public-private partnerships are not common in China and could pose difficulties both for the government and industries. China’s operating practices have largely been that the government writes regulations and the industries implements them (and often seeks to subvert them). And to the extent that many of the unscrupulous sellers of nonscheduled precursors are medium and small firms with smaller legal global market access and thus fewer incentives for compliance, the monitoring and enforcement challenge remains large and resource-intensive.</p>
<p><em>Firms that violate agreed-upon standards</em> should be put on probation and, if no significant improvement and compliance takes place, <em>should be cut out of the U.S. market and/or indicted by the U.S. government</em>. Washington can insist that Beijing shut down the worst offenders.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a risk that U.S. indictments, or any new U.S. laws mandating that only chemical firms with certain standards can sell to the U.S. market, might stimulate China to retaliate against U.S. businesses seeking access to China’s market — whether by finding reasons to bring criminal investigations against U.S. companies or by organizing social media-led boycotts. China has previously resorted to both.<sup class="endnote-pointer">56</sup> Moreover, many unscrupulous sellers are likely to sell their precursors or finished synthetic drugs to drug traffickers abroad, such as the Mexican groups, instead of directly into the United States.</p>
<p><em>With respect to prominent Chinese pharmaceutical and chemical industry officials</em>, the <em>United States can develop packages of leverage</em>, such as denying them visas if their companies fail to adopt global standards of preventing diversion. Powerful Chinese industry actors may thus be incentivized to promote stricter regulatory standards and their enforcement within China.</p>
<p>But as in the case of U.S. actions against Chinese companies, the Chinese government might retaliate against U.S. individuals and look for ways to charge them with criminal conduct or espionage and arrest them.<sup class="endnote-pointer">57</sup> Thus, the implementation of such a sanctioning mechanism would need to be judged very carefully within the broad context of U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p><em>With respect to Chinese traffickers</em>, the United States should of <em>course continue to develop legal indictment portfolios against them and their companies</em>, even if China will not arrest, prosecute, and extradite them. Because of the poor state of human rights in China, the U.S. should continue to refuse to sign an extradition treaty with China. But Washington can and should deploy other punitive measures, such as <em>limiting traffickers’ access to the international financial system, preventing their international travel, or attempting to have third countries arrest </em>them and extradite them to the United States. Nonetheless, such indictments, particularly if the indicted individuals are linked to the Chinese government or the CCP, may not stimulate China to engage in more extensive counternarcotics cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p><em>Working with other international partners, the United States could encourage China to start moving more seriously against Chinese drug trafficking networks in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</em> But as long as these criminal groups also serve China’s economic and internal control interests, such as against Chinese diasporas, Beijing’s willingness to move against them will remain small. Thus, the United States will need to rely on <em>and incentivize other regional partners to vigorously undermine those networks</em>, even as new will emerge in their wake. However, particularly if in the future the replacement networks were not Chinese, the U.S. law enforcement challenges could diminish.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Inducing Cooperation from Mexico </em></strong></h3>
<p>Various U.S. lawmakers have proposed designated Mexican criminal groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO).</p>
<p>An FTO designation would enable intelligence gathering and strike options of the United States military, such as against some fentanyl labs in Mexico or visible formations of large Mexican cartels — principally CJNG.</p>
<p>However, such unilateral U.S. military actions in Mexico would severely jeopardize relations with our vital trading partner and neighbor whose society is deeply intertwined with ours through familial connections.  Calls for U.S. military strikes against fentanyl-linked targets in Mexico has already been condemned by Mexican government officials, politicians, and commentators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of available targets in Mexico would be limited. Most Mexican criminal groups do not gather in military-like visible formations. Many fentanyl labs already operate in buildings in populated neighborhoods of towns and cities where strikes would not be possible due to risks to Mexican civilians. Moreover, fentanyl labs would easily be recreated.</p>
<p>Nor would the FTO designation add authorities to the economic sanctions and anti-money laundering and financial intelligence tools that the already-in-place designation of Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO) carries. The latter designation also carries extensive prohibitions against material support.</p>
<p>But <em>an FTO designation could significantly limit and outright hamper U.S. foreign policy options and measures</em>. Clauses against material support for designated terrorist organizations have made it difficult for the United States to implement non-military and non-law-enforcement policy measures in a wide range of countries, such as to provide assistance for legal job creation or reintegration support for even populations that had to endure the rule of brutal terrorist groups. To be in compliance with the material support laws, the United States and other entities must guarantee that none of their financial or material assistance is leaking out, including through coerced extortion, to those designated as FTOs.</p>
<p>Yet such controls would be a significant challenge in Mexico where many people and businesses in legal economies, such as agriculture, fisheries, logging, mining, and retail, have to pay extortion fees to Mexican criminal groups. The attempted controls could undermine the ability to trade with Mexico as many U.S. businesses would not be able to determine whether their Mexican trading or production partner was paying extortion fees to Mexican cartels, and thus guarantee that they were not indirectly in violation of material support clauses.</p>
<p>The FTO designation could hamper the delivery of U.S. training, such as to local police forces or Mexican federal law enforcement agencies, if guarantees could not be established that such counterparts had no infiltration by criminal actors.</p>
<p>Instead, if the López Obrador administration continues to deny meaningful law enforcement cooperation, <em>the United States may have to resort to significantly intensified border inspections,</em> even if they significantly slow down the legal trade and cause substantial damage to Mexican goods, such as agricultural products. Under optimal circumstances, U.S.-Mexico law enforcement cooperation would be robust enough to make legal border crossings fast and efficient. Joint fentanyl and precursor busts and seizures could take place near production labs and at warehouses. The inspections of legal cargo heading to the United States could take place close to production and loading site in Mexico. Under the Merida Initiative, the Obama administration, in fact, sought to develop with Mexico such systems of legal cargo inspection inside Mexico and away from the border. But if Mexico refuses to act as a reliable law enforcement partner to counter the greatest drug epidemic in North America, which is also decimating lives in Mexico, the United States may have to focus much intensified inspections at the border, despite the economic pains.</p>
<p><em>Packages of leverage, including indictment portfolios</em>, could also be developed against <em>Mexican national security and law enforcement officials and politicians</em> who undermine and sabotage rule of law cooperation with the United States.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Expanding and Smartening Up U.S. Measures against Criminal Actors</em></strong></h3>
<p>Importantly, the United States has significant opportunities rapidly to strengthen and smarten up its own measures against Chinese and Mexican criminal actors participating in fentanyl and other drug trafficking while simultaneously also enhancing U.S. measures to counter wildlife trafficking and protect public health and global biodiversity.</p>
<p>Mexican drug cartels have diversified their activities into a wide array of illicit and licit commodities. Similarly, some Chinese actors smuggling fentanyl are also involved in wildlife trade and trafficking. Some are connecting to the CCP and Chinese government officials. Corruption networks permeate all levels of the Mexican government.</p>
<p><strong><em>Primarily focusing on drug seizures close to source is no longer sufficient for effectively disrupting fentanyl smuggling and criminal networks implicated in it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Rather, countering poaching and wildlife trafficking from Mexico and illegal logging and mining in places where the Mexican cartels have a reach, acting against illegal fishing off Mexico and around Latin America and elsewhere, and shutting down wildlife trafficking networks into China are increasingly an important element of countering Mexican and Chinese drug-trafficking groups and reducing the flow of fentanyl to the United States.</em></strong></p>
<p>To effectively counter fentanyl-smuggling actors requires a whole-of-government approach — not simply on paper, but truly in implementation. <strong><em>A wide range of U.S. government agencies should be authorized to support U.S. law enforcement against Mexican and Chinese criminal actors, fentanyl trafficking, and crimes against nature. These include U.S. intelligence agencies, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).</em></strong></p>
<p>Moreover, the focused collection, analysis, and reporting of<strong><em> intelligence by a variety of U.S. government actors against wildlife trafficking, illegal fishing, and illegal mining could beget new opportunities to understand the criminal linkages to foreign governments, including China’s, to confirm or dismiss concerns as to whether Chinese fishing vessels carry spy equipment, and to identify the crucial vulnerabilities of Mexican and other dangerous cartels. </em></strong></p>
<p>To such end, <strong><em>crimes against nature should be elevated as a Collection and Reporting priority of the U.S. Intelligence Community, and within the U.S. National Priorities Framework.</em></strong></p>
<p>Stove-piping in information and intelligence gathering across a wide set of illicit economies should be ended. Gathered information and intelligence should be shared with interagency analysis groups intent upon interdicting the illicit international flow of scheduled drugs and endangered species. Such efforts could be enabled by increasing the number of USFWS special agents and by augmenting their respective participation in interagency Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) investigations.</p>
<p>The relevant intelligence on crimes against nature to understand and dismantle criminal networks could include names, phone number, license plates, courier accounts, bank accounts, and wiretapped conversations. Conversely, countering groups perpetrating crimes against nature could be productive in terms of freezing accounts and visas to interdict the smuggling of drugs, guns, and humans that they’re conducting.</p>
<p>Enhancing intelligence collection and law enforcement action opportunities stemming from such an expanded lens to cover <strong><em>all </em></strong>of the activities, including crimes against nature, of dangerous and nefarious actors, such as Mexican cartels and Chinese criminal groups, <strong><em>requires enlarging the pool of USFWS special agents and uniformed wildlife inspectors </em></strong>at the U.S.-Mexico border and at transportation hubs within the United States<strong><em>.</em></strong>  The DEA appropriately enjoys strong capacities, currently maintaining a force of 4000 agents.<sup class="endnote-pointer">58</sup> In contrast, the number of USFWS special agents has for years hovered at a mere and insufficient 220.<sup class="endnote-pointer">59</sup> For years, this inadequate number has not increased even though poaching, illegal logging, and mining, and trafficking in natural resource commodities have grown enormously over the past three decades, continue expanding, and increasingly involve Mexican drug cartels as well as Chinese criminal networks.</p>
<p>As a corollary and imperative effort, U.S. law enforcement agencies’ legal authorities to counter wildlife trafficking should be expanded. Importantly, <strong><em>wildlife trafficking should be designated as a predicate offense for wiretap authorizations.<sup class="endnote-pointer">60 </sup></em></strong>Such expanded authority would bring about multiple benefits: including the enabling, understanding, and demonstration of the connections between wildlife and transnational organized crime networks and foreign bad actors, enhancing the ability to disrupt fentanyl trafficking, and allowing for more expeditious and pointed prosecution of wildlife trafficking crimes. Currently, federal legislation at the foundation of wildlife crime prosecution, at the core of which is the Lacey Act, often entails proof of knowledge on the part of the defendant, a requirement that wiretap authorization would greatly facilitate, in the interest of prosecuting transnational wildlife trafficking and convicting criminal syndicates.</p>
<p>Many fentanyl-trafficking networks are not narrowly specialized in fentanyl or drugs only. Many Mexican cartels and criminal groups no longer solely focus on drug smuggling. Fentanyl smuggling networks have powerful protectors among corrupt government officials worldwide. Incentivizing better cooperation from the Chinese and Mexican criminal governments is important. But particularly given the challenges in inducing such cooperation in the current geopolitical environment and given the policy orientation of the current Mexican government, it is equally crucial to enhance the United States’ own policy tools to counter fentanyl-trafficking networks. Expanding the intelligence-gathering aperture and mandating and resourcing a whole-of-government approach in support of U.S. law enforcement will save U.S. lives currently decimated by fentanyl overdoses.<a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"></a></p>
