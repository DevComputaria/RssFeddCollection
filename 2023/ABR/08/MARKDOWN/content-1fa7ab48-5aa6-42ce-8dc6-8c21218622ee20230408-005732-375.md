Forget SMS 2FA authentication – Twitter and others are making it less attractive by either charging for it or phasing it out altogether. But there’s a better alternative if only tech companies were willing to invest. By John E. Dunn Mention Twitter and two factor authentication (2FA) in the same breath right now and security watchers will immediately think about a puzzling announcement the company made less than two months ago.

Charitably, this was probably intended as a nudge to make people upgrade to more secure options such as authentication apps or hardware tokens, which remain free of charge. More likely, people pointed out, its effect will be to encourage some users to stop using 2FA altogether.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Arguably frustrating for some given the extra step and the delay it creates when logging in, yet for all its failings, SMS 2FA has always had one big feature going for it - it is incredibly easy to use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Alternative Authentication</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s true that putting a paywall between users and this simplicity is bothersome. Users could use an authentication app instead but that means downloading it, enrolling the app to Twitter, unlocking the app each time with a PIN or fingerprint, switching between apps to get a six-digit code before entering it at each login.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Or they could buy a FIDO U2F token. They’re easier to use – a simple finger press - but they cost around $30 each, still need to be enrolled, and let’s not forget that you need a second one as a backup in case you lose the other one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is the tension that has thwarted 2FA take-up among consumers from the start. You can have more security, but it’ll probably be less convenient. If you make it too easy – sending one-time passcodes via SMS – hackers will find ways around this using SIM jacking, man-in-the middle attacks, or bogus account resets.&#0160; </span> <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The massive irony of this debate is that almost nobody uses Twitter 2FA in the first place. According to </span><a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/account-security.html#2021-jul-dec"><span data-contrast="none">its own figures</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from 2021, the percentage of users with at least one 2FA method turned on is a ridiculously low 2.6%. At Google, take-up is better at 10% but that still means 90% have it turned off.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Frankly, for Twitter, as for so many other big web sites and services, the much-ballyhooed era of 2FA security has been an illusion all along. Most big web platforms turned 2FA on around 2013 and the only people using it a decade later seem to be corporates and expert users.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">The push alternative</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Frustratingly, a possible way out of this 2FA impasse already exists in the form of push notification.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The technology is already widely adopted for business MFA and is simple to use. Users download an app and enroll their phones. Each time they log on from then on, a message pops up on their device asking them to authenticate their login with a yes/no.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The advantage is that the user can authenticate with a single tap, backed by a conventional authentication code in situations where network communication is a problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Admittedly, there are downsides. Push requires companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, or a third-party security vendor to act as a notification gateway. There have also been attacks on push notifications such as MFA fatigue which bombard users with rogue push requests until they agree to one to make them stop coming.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A lot of these issues can be addressed through tweaks such as Microsoft’s number matching push system, or by rate limiting the number of push notifications that can be sent. Push notification apps also now give users more information about requests such as their geo-location and the device they were made from.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But push notifications have one more trick up their sleeve that deserves to make them every security manager’s best friend.&#0160;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The whole reason 2FA is needed in the first place is that password credentials are incredibly prone to compromise. Once an attacker has these, organizations and individuals become vulnerable to an attempted bypass or social engineering attack at some point.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Credential compromise is dangerous because admins have no way of knowing it has happened. They know the problem is likely but not when or against whom it will occur. It follows then that rogue notifications are a warning that something is wrong. If your users have been bombarded with multiple push notifications that weren’t from them that’s telling admins to change that user’s credentials immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As long as admins remember to give their users a channel for reporting suspicious push requests, it’s like having a free password compromise alerting system built into authentication.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Will Twitter, or any other consumer social networking site adopt push? That seems highly unlikely. Setting up push notification would cost money at a company that seems happier cutting costs at the moment. However, as the industry embarks on the long and probably slow journey towards a password-less future, we could do a lot worse than giving push notifications a closer look. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Millions of WordPress websites using the popular Elementor Pro website builder and the WooCommerce plugin have been exposed to a serious security vulnerability. The flaw, which affects Elementor Pro versions 3.11.6 and earlier, allows malicious actors to change the default user privileges to include administrator access. The vulnerability was patched in a March 22 update, but the number of reported incidents indicates that most website administrators have yet to install it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybersecurity researchers have found a new ransomware strain called Rorschach that is extraordinarily sophisticated and faster at encrypting data than any other documented strain. Once a system is infected, Rorschach works to replicate itself across a network and cover its tracks. It also employs several situational features that the ransomware controller can use to alter its trajectory. In one controlled test, LockBit ransomware encrypted a drive in seven minutes, while Rorschach encrypted the same drive in four and a half minutes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Western Digital, the California-based hard drive and flash storage maker, has announced that it was breached by an unauthorized party. The network security incident was first discovered on March 26 and announced earlier this week. The investigation is still in its early stages. As such, Western Digital has yet to divulge any details on what data or systems threat actors were able to access. One likely candidate is My Cloud, the company’s cloud-linked, network-attached storage (NAS) service. It suffered a significant outage after the announcement of the cyberattack.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A prominent business process outsourcing firm in the U.K. revealed that a cyberattack disrupted access to its Microsoft Office 365 applications. More than 50,000 specialists and contractors work for Capita, which provides services to the U.K.’s National Health Service, the government’s military infrastructure, London’s public transport network and more. Capita first described the outage on March 31 as an ‘IT issue’ but later admitted it was the result of a cyberattack. The firm claims that, as of yet, there is no evidence of cybercriminals gaining access to customer, supplier or staff data.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A team of information security researchers have demonstrated the viability of what they’re calling a Near-Ultrasound Inaudible Trojan (NUIT). This novel cyberattack involves threat actors creating and broadcasting inaudible sounds that grant remote access and control to Apple&#39;s Siri, Amazon&#39;s Alexa, Microsoft&#39;s Cortana and Google&#39;s Assistant. Researchers are concerned that cybercriminals could embed sound bites into YouTube videos, music playlists or other trusted audio sources, thereby issuing silent commands to security systems, financial applications and private databases.&#0160;&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

We all learn differently. And we all have different schedules and needs when it comes to certification training. In the past, finding the time to train has been limiting for some. Enter adaptive online training, a new and innovative way to prep for certification that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor the learning journey to each individual’s needs. It provides a non-linear, personalized learning experience that works well for busy professionals who want to upskill without having to rely on traditional linear learning models, which can be restrictive about time and pace.

And we all have different schedules and needs when it comes to certification training. In the past, finding the time to train has been limiting for some.</p>
<p>Enter adaptive online training, a new and innovative way to prep for certification that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor the learning journey to each individual’s needs. It provides a non-linear, personalized learning experience that works well for busy professionals who want to upskill without having to rely on traditional linear learning models, which can be restrictive about time and pace.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>How it works</strong></span></p>
<p>(ISC)² is leading the way in rolling out this flexible learning option for certification training. Official (ISC)² Online Training uses AI-led adaptive learning to provide individualized learning paths based on prior knowledge, learning speed and confidence levels. Learners answer questions using sliders to rate their level of confidence, which helps to detect knowledge gaps while building self-awareness regarding competency. Analytics provide a complete overview of learning progress and performance. The platform also identifies specific areas that require further study so that you’re better prepared on exam day.</p>
<p>The training features interactive, engaging courses designed for professionals of different experience levels, taking into consideration their time and expertise. For example, highly experienced professionals may not need to cover every domain with the same level of detail as someone less experienced. One of the benefits of the adaptive self-paced training is that learners can direct their experience or rely on the AI to guide them through it. In contrast, traditional linear training requires learners to complete each module, even if they don’t need further study in certain areas.</p>
<p>The new training also offers a robust search capability that enables learners to find the content they need, when they need it. It includes an analytics dashboard to track progress and see concept-by-concept performance changes over time. Easy and accessible email support is available for those who require additional assistance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Education guarantee</span> </strong></p>
<p>For learners who don’t pass the exam on their first attempt, (ISC)² offers an education guarantee. Learners can access the same training again at no cost to them within one year from the end of the initial training. The education guarantee covers the cost of the second course.</p>
<p>AI-driven adaptive learning is a game-changer for certification training. It provides a personalized learning experience tailored to the individual learner’s needs, enabling them to upskill faster and smarter.</p>

In the latest of several recent announcements, the U.S. body responsible for cybersecurity is making a clear shift towards pre-emptive over reactionary reporting, alerting and advice for organizations. By John E. Dunn A defining characteristic of ransomware attacks is the element of surprise. By the time the victim receives the ransom note, it is usually already too late to contain an incident. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has announced a new pilot project, the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative, which it hopes will be able to notify more victims before this happens.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The premise is that attackers often linger inside networks for some time before striking. This offers a window of opportunity, according to CISA:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“These early warnings can enable victims to safely evict the ransomware actors from their networks before the actors have a chance to encrypt and hold critical data and systems at ransom.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Getting ahead of ransomware sounds like a tall order but CISA said it had already helped 60 organizations since the beginning of 2023 across sectors including energy, healthcare, water treatment and education.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">The Source of the Intelligence</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The announcement doesn’t say where the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative gets its intelligence from but some of it is probably fed from the also recently announced Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/Ransomware-Vulnerability-Warning-Pilot"><span data-contrast="none">RVWP</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">).&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The rest is based on risk-assessing vulnerabilities using tools that scan critical infrastructure for vulnerabilities that might be exploited by ransomware.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Once CISA identifies these affected systems, our regional cybersecurity personnel notify system owners of their security vulnerabilities, thus enabling timely mitigation before damaging intrusions occur,” said CISA.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s not clear how much is preemptive defense based on intelligence about a compromise in progress and how much is just risk-based guesswork.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The RVWP itself was established in response to the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/information-sharing/cyber-incident-reporting-critical-infrastructure-act-2022-circia"><span data-contrast="none">CIRCIA</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">), part of a remarkable flurry of executive orders relating to cybersecurity signed into law by the Biden administration.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">A workable idea?&#0160;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The assumption of an early warning is that there is time for one to be given. This has a lot to do with the fact that the groups who initially compromise networks are not always the ones who execute the later attack. Instead, they sell on their access to specialists.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The handover between one group and another can extend to weeks or months, at least in some cases. That, presumably, gives something like the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative time to warn victims if they uncover evidence of the earlier incursion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Equally, not all ransomware attacks take their time. Some strike within days. Nevertheless, helping 60 organizations in less than three months is an encouraging start.&#0160;</span><span data-contrast="auto">There are limitations in scope. The initiative is aimed at critical infrastructure, for instance, and is not designed to help the SMEs outside these sectors, for instance.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative and the RVWP are part of CISA’s larger </span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/stopransomware"><span data-contrast="none">Stop Ransomware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> campaign which offers organizations the ability to report incidents and receive ransomware alerts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/03/27/bec-scammers-physical-goods/"><strong><span data-contrast="none">FBI Alerts U.S. Companies of Email Scam Targeting Commercial Goods</span></strong></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned companies of a new type of business email compromise (BEC) fraud. Threat actors are impersonating known and reputable U.S.-based companies by spoofing email domains and display names of employees to place large orders for material goods without paying upfront. When vendors try to collect payment, they find that the purchaser was an impersonator using fake credentials or credit references.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/microsoft-issues-patch-for-acropalypse.html"><strong><span data-contrast="none">Windows Users Urged to Update Snipping Tool to Avoid “aCropalypse”</span></strong></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An emergency update from Microsoft addresses a vulnerability in its Windows 10 app Snip &amp; Sketch and its Windows 11 Snipping Tool. Referred to as ‘aCropalypse’, the vulnerability allows bad actors to potentially view sensitive information contained within sections of a screenshot that have been cropped out. Although the attack requires several variables outside of the control of a cybercriminal to align, it puts screenshots of bank statements, login credentials and health records at significant risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The U.K.&#39;s National Crime Agency (NCA) announced that it has been running several fake websites purporting to sell Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) services. When visitors to the site attempt to sign up for the service and provide details of their request, their submissions actually go to the NCA for analysis. Data is shared with international law enforcement and has led to several arrests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For approximately nine hours, 1.2% of all ChatGPT users were shown someone else’s billing information on the ‘Manage Subscription’ page. Breached data fields included chat histories, first and last names, billing addresses, credit card types, credit card expiration dates and the last four digits of credit cards. OpenAI confirmed that a vulnerability in one of its open-source libraries was responsible for the breach and has fixed the issue.&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it has complete access to a SQL database that tracked user histories on the site. Experts believe that details contained within the database will bolster efforts to bring down other forums and dark web marketplaces. The forum’s founder, Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, has been arrested and charged with the theft and sale of sensitive personal data belonging to U.S. citizens, as well as foreign companies, organizations and government agencies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

The consumer lending company has now confirmed the theft of 14 million records containing personal data on Australian and New Zealander loan applicants. Malicious actors breached systems containing customers’ driver’s license information, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. Latitude Financial promises to pay document replacement fees and credit monitoring for those affected by the breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A new phishing campaign employing the Emotet malware is masquerading as U.S. W-9 tax forms attached to emails claiming to come from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and business partners. When opened, the Microsoft OneNote document initiates a VBScript that installs the Emotet malware to remain open without the user’s knowledge. The program steals victims&#39; email records to target friends and colleagues and may eventually act as a back door for other malware campaigns.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}">&#0160;</span></p>

Anxiety about the security of hot wallets grows as General Bytes customers are hit by a zero-day flaw in the company’s Bitcoin ATMs. By John E. Dunn It’s fair to say that crypto has an image problem. What it didn’t need was a Bitcoin ATM (BATM) hack to generate even more bad publicity. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened on March 17-18, according to General Bytes, one of the best-known makers of BATMs on the market. Hackers exploited a zero-day flaw in a video interface that’s part of the General Bytes CAS server platform to steal 56 Bitcoins (worth $1.5 million)...
