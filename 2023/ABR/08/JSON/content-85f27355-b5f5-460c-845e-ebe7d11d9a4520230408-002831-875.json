Kacsmaryk, which does not go into immediate effect, was unclear.</p>\n<p>The abortion drug has been widely used in the U.S. since 2000 and there is essentially no precedent for a lone judge overruling the medical decisions of the Food and Drug Administration. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used for medication abortion in the United States, along with misoprostol, which is also used to treat other medical conditions.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Kacsmaryk, a Trump administration appointee in Amarillo, Texas, signed an injunction directing the FDA to stay mifepristone&rsquo;s approval while a lawsuit challenging the safety and approval of the drug continues. His 67-page order gave the government seven days to appeal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Simply put, FDA stonewalled judicial review&mdash;until now,&rdquo; Kacsmaryk wrote.</p>\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t go as far as the plaintiffs wanted by withdrawing or suspending the approval of the chemical abortion drug and removing it from the list of approved drugs. But he put a &ldquo;stay&rdquo; or hold on approval of the drug.</p>\n<p>Federal lawyers representing the FDA are <a href=\"https://time.com/6259651/abortion-pills-texas-ruling-biden-response/\" >expected to swiftly appeal</a>.</p>\n<p>Clinics and doctors that prescribe the two-drug combination have said that if mifepristone were pulled from the market, they would switch to using only the second drug, misoprostol. That single-drug approach has a slightly lower rate of effectiveness in ending pregnancies, but it is widely used in countries where mifepristone is illegal or unavailable.</p>\n<p>Mifepristone is part of a two-drug regimen that has long been the standard for medication abortion in the U.S. Clinics and doctors that prescribe the combination say they plan to switch to using only misoprostol. The single-drug approach is slightly less effective at ending pregnancies.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, which was also involved in the Mississippi case that led to Roe v. Wade being overturned. At the core of the lawsuit is the allegation that the FDA&rsquo;s initial approval of mifepristone was flawed because it did not adequately review its safety risks.</p>\n<p>Courts have long deferred to the FDA on issues of drug safety and effectiveness. But the agency&rsquo;s authority faces new challenges in a <a href=\"https://time.com/6190995/abortion-future-after-roe/\" >post-Roe legal environment</a> in which abortions are banned or unavailable in 14 states, while 16 states have laws specifically targeting abortion medications.</p>\n"

But in the last few years, the industry seems to have finally cracked the code on bringing video games to the big screen. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> and <a href=\"https://time.com/4788898/uncharted-movie-prequel-tom-holland/\" ><em>Uncharted</em></a> were pandemic hits. <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is tracking as the biggest movie opening of 2023. And on television, <a href=\"https://time.com/5762248/witcher-netflix-game/\" ><em>The Witcher</em></a> and <a href=\"https://time.com/6247205/the-last-of-us-hbo-adaptation/\" ><em>The Last of Us</em></a> have done blockbuster numbers.</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t heap too much praise on Hollywood. The reality is that video games have become so cinematic in their scope, storytelling, and visuals that they&#8217;ve superseded some films in terms of their ambition and emotional resonance. HBO&#8217;s <em>The Last of Us</em> stayed <a href=\"https://time.com/6260904/the-last-of-us-ending-explained/\" >close to its source material</a> exactly because the original game was designed, essentially, as interactive cinema with all the twists and heartbreaks one might expect from a prestige project.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><em>The Last of Us</em> is certainly one of the best video game stories ever created but it&#8217;s not unique. Other adventure games such as <em>God of War</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn, </em>and <i>Bioshock</i> explore philosophical themes and test the player&#8217;s ethical boundaries.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason for the success of video game adaptations, studios are now jockeying for the next <em>Last of Us</em> level hit. It&#8217;s an obvious place for expansion, considering video games have now overtaken films in the market. Across the world, people spent $184.4 billion on gaming in 2022, dwarfing the total global revenue of $26 billion at the box office last year. The major gaming studios are now even bigger than movie studios.</p>\n<p>Amazon and Netflix have invested especially heavily in future video game adaptations, snapping up the rights to just about every popular game that&#8217;s been released in the last decade&mdash;be they AAA productions or indies. Big names including Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (<em>Westworld</em>), Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Fleabag</em>), and Chad Stahelski (<em>John Wick 4</em>) have all been recruited to figure out how to transform game stories into a more passive medium. Here are 18 video games currently being adapted for film and TV.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/6241656/most-anticipated-video-games-2023/\" ><em>The Most Anticipated

The story centered on their tenuous relationship after the death of Atrues&#8217; mother Faye and the journey they take together to spread her ashes from the highest peak in the Nine Realms. The fifth game, <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, became the fastest-selling game in PlayStation&#8217;s history.

emerge in the last decade, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> focuses on a chosen-one type character named Aloy living in a post-apocalyptic world where animal-like mechanical beasts roam free. Parentless and banned from her tribe as a child, Aloy unwinds the mysteries of the past and her planet while contending with a mysterious, all-knowing figure named Sylens (voiced by the late, great Lance Reddick). Netflix has announced that Steve Blackman, showrunner of <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>, will helm the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> series.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/6235588/best-video-games-2022/\" >The 10 Best Video Games of 2022</a></em></p>\n<h2><em>Fallout</em> on Amazon Prime (TBA)</h2>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?w=560&w=560\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg 1024w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=550,309 550w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=280,158 280w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=560,315 560w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=419,236 419w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=838,471 838w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=1012,569 1012w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=407,229 407w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=814,458 814w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=190,107 190w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=380,214 380w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=263,148 263w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=526,296 526w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=61,34 61w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=840,473 840w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=616,347 616w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=321,180 321w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=642,360 642w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=925,520 925w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=243,136 243w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=364,204 364w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=486,272 486w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=801,451 801w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=295,166 295w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=590,332 590w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=760,428 760w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=700,394 700w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=55,31 55w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=730,411 730w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=405,229 405w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=192,108 192w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=444,250 444w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=479,269 479w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=958,539 958w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=767,431 767w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg?resize=100,55 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Bethesda</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan of <em>Westworld</em> fame are writing an original story set in the world of <em>Fallout</em>. The long-running video game series, set in a dieselpunk wasteland decimated by a nuclear bomb, has hopped around to different time periods and locations across America in its decades-long run, and it&#8217;s unclear where and when Joy and Nolan have chosen to set their series. But we will definitely see ghouls, humans whose exposure to nuclear radiation has melted their flesh but given them inhuman longevity.

the <em>Tomb Raider </em>franchise&mdash;again. Angelina Jolie starred as the British aristrocrat-turned-treasure hunter back in 2001, and Alicia Vikander took over the role in 2018. None of the Lara Croft films have exactly gone down in history as masterpieces of cinema. But she&#8217;s a complex character. While arguably the first female video game character to break out into the mainstream, she originally she existed largely to be ogled. Lara thankfully got a makeover in the games in the 2010s: She now has a more realistic body as well as a complex backstory. Waller-Bridge may bring her wry sense of humor to the tale and send up the character&#8217;s complex history.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a

office. But now Netflix is hoping it can wring several different series out of the franchise, making both live-action and anime adaptations. The plot of the Assassin&#8217;s Creed games gets complicated quickly and involves a millennia-long struggle between a group called the Order of Assassins and the Knights Templar. The important part to remember is each game is set in a different place and time period&mdash;Renaissance Italy, the American Revolution, Ancient Egypt&mdash;and begs a for a historically-minded globe-trotting show massive in its size and scale.</p>\n<h2><em>Bioshock</em> on Netflix (TBA)</h2>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"

detective trying to solve a case while struggling with drug-induced amnesia in politically volatile city. The game depends heavily on the choices you make for your character: You can choose to be a fascist, a communist, a moralist, or an ultraliberal; a drug addict or a recovering addict; a thinker or a brawler. Your interactions with people in the game change depending on your decisions, but whatever you choose you&#8217;re bound to have fascinating and sometimes disturbing philosophical debates. It will certainly be a challenge for a showrunner will figure out how to adapt the fungible yet consistently despicable character to the television format.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a

In the game, the player plays a kung-fu master on a mission of revenge. Every time the player dies in the game, the character returns having aged but also learned a new level of skills. The player moves through the game, at first as a young student and eventually grows into an old master. It&#8217;s a concept that will certainly be challenging to capture onscreen, whether it involves CGI-aging a single actor or casting multiple actors to plain the main character.</p>\n<h2><em>Life Is Strange</em> on Amazon Prime (TBA)</h2>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?w=560&w=560\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg 1280w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=550,309 550w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1100,619 1100w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=280,158 280w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=560,315 560w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=419,236 419w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=838,471 838w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1012,569 1012w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=407,229 407w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=814,458 814w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=190,107 190w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=380,214 380w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=263,148 263w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=526,296 526w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=61,34 61w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=840,473 840w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=616,347 616w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1232,693 1232w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=321,180 321w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=642,360 642w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=925,520 925w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=243,136 243w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=364,204 364w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=486,272 486w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=801,451 801w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1201,676 1201w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=295,166 295w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=590,332 590w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=760,428 760w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=700,394 700w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=55,31 55w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=730,411 730w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=405,229 405w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=192,108 192w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=444,250 444w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=479,269 479w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=958,539 958w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=767,431 767w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/life-is-strange.jpg?resize=100,55 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Square Enix</span><span class=\"caption\" >Life Is Strange</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A lot of the video game adaptations are genre works that will require effects-heavy productions. But <em>Life Is Strange</em> is set in our world, though the main character in the first game Max Caulfield discovers she has the ability to rewind time. The game explores the butterfly effect of Max&#8217;s actions, allowing the player to move back in time and change the narrative. Released in an episodic format and with a focus on character development, the series seems tail0r-made for episodic television.</p>\n<h2><em>It Takes Two</em> on Amazon Prime (TBA)</h2>\n<figure

However, some schools may have been left off both lists if they weren&rsquo;t reported in local news. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Why are there more fake calls now?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FBI said in a statement to TIME on Tuesday that it is &ldquo;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actively investigating these dangerous and criminal threats,&rdquo; although it has &ldquo;no information to indicate a specific and credible threat at this tim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e.&rdquo; In November, it said that the calls may be coming from outside the U.S., the AP</span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shootings-race-and-ethnicity-government-politics-cea91facddabed823513f205073a441f\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure why there are so many calls, especially because technology can make it nearly impossible to identify perpetrators or hold them accountable. What&#8217;s worse, the callers may not even be in the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The big issue, says Klinger, is that school shootings are a very real threat in the United States, which bad actors can prey upon. &ldquo;It makes sense. <a href=\"https://time.com/6182235/mass-shootings-children-mental-health-anxiety-depression/\" >We&#8217;re scared of school shootings</a>, because they happen,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And so it is a thing that people can use against us.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has also made it easier for people to conceal their identities, says Fred Posner, a communications consultant for LOD Communications, a technical consulting company. In the last few years, he says, VPNs (virtual private networks) became cheaper and more common, which makes it easy to conceal your identity. Layered on top of that, he says, phone carriers can now provide phone numbers to anyone, anywhere if they have an internet connection. Without inputting so much as a credit card, ID or even real name, he says, people can make digital phone calls from anywhere&mdash;even another country, he says. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1129919258/swatting-fake-school-shooter-calls-hoax-pattern\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPR investigation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that the carrier TextNow was used to make at least some of the fake calls to schools this fall. The calls appear to have originated from Ethiopia, the NPR report found. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For law enforcement, tracking phone calls through such companies is &ldquo;almost impossible,&rdquo; Posner says.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why swatting is so dangerous</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swatting can be terrifying for the children, teachers and parents, who rightfully fear for their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The threat may also place everyone involved <a href=\"https://time.com/5101997/tyler-barriss-swatting-manslaughter-charge/\" >in physical danger</a>. If they anticipate that there&rsquo;s an active shooter at a school, emergency responders may speed to the scene&mdash;and, guns at their sides, may rush into a school expecting to see an active shooter. On Monday, for instance, Harvard University campus police allegedly pointed assault rifles at four students, who are Black, after a hoax 911 call about an armed person in their suite, the Harvard </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crimson </span></i><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/4/4/lev-swatting-attack/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As hoax calls rise, it&rsquo;s critically important that schools and law enforcement remain ready for a real attack, says Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;We still have to respond as if they&#8217;re actually happening,&rdquo; says Canady. &ldquo;We can&#8217;t allow ourselves to go there to think oh, this is another one of those fake calls. That&#8217;s the time when it won&#8217;t be.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<h2><b>What can be done to stop fake school threats?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many public comments about swatting, lawmakers and law enforcement emphasized the importance of bringing perpetrators to justice. For instance, after a spate of calls in New York, Senator Chuck Schumer </span><a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2023/04/05/chuck-schumer-announces-plan-to-address-uptick-in-swatting-incidents/70085336007/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a plan for a new FBI team to chase down hoax callers. &ldquo;We need more agents to track down these evil criminals who hide in the darkest corners of the internet,&#8221; Schumer </span><a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/sen-schumer-calls-for-federal-action-following-multiple-swatting-threats\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on April 5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given how hard it is to trace perpetrators&mdash;and to stop them from wanting to make calls&mdash;Posner argues that a better strategy may be to instead focus on the carriers, like TextNow, to stop enabling people to use their networks with so little verification.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;There&#8217;s absolutely no deterrent for them to provide the service to people conducting illegal activities,&rdquo; says Posner. &ldquo;Even the feds, there&#8217;s not a ton that they can do&mdash;unless we get an FTC or Congress that&rsquo;s willing to put some bite into putting carriers somewhat responsible for allowing this type of traffic to cross their networks.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"

A grieving Alex, visiting his family in Mexico, is slowly discovering who he is, with the help of his grandfather&rsquo;s tough love, as he approaches adulthood, Bichir tells TIME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;It seems like he&#8217;s pushing him to do something he doesn&#8217;t want to do, but he&#8217;s only pushing him to face his own fears, and to face his own sadness, and to take it out,&rdquo; Bichir says. &ldquo;We tend to keep many of our feelings to ourselves, unless someone helps you to take it out.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On his coming-of-age journey, Alex finds Chupa, a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chupacabra</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cub, on his grandfather&rsquo;s ranch. (A </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chupacabra</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a mythical creature of Latin American folklore that is said to drink the blood of goats. Chupa himself is more cuddly than terrifying, although his fully-grown family feels more classically scary.) The titular monster cub has been separated from his parent, and becomes a poignant foil for Alex&rsquo;s own loss&mdash;and his gradual realization that, as his mother tells him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve

Sure, when we think of Barbie we often think of the blonde living in Malibu who splits her time between her jobs as an astronaut, President of the United States, and fashionista. But Mattel has released endless variations of Barbie over the years&mdash;and plenty of Kens too.</p>\n<p>And Greta Gerwig&#8217;s highly anticipated <a href=\"https://time.com/5743438/greta-gerwig-little-women-interview/\" ><em>Barbie</em> movie</a> is chock-full of Mattel dolls. Margot Robbie is Barbie&#8230;and so is Issa Rae&#8230;and so is Dua Lipa, just to name a few. And Ryan Gosling&#8217;s Ken seems to be competing for Barbie&#8217;s affections with Simu Liu&#8217;s Ken and Kingsley Ben-Adir&#8217;s Ken and other various rivals.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>But Barbieland isn&#8217;t just home to Barbies and Kens. It&#8217;s filled with other, slightly less famous Mattel dolls whose jobs have been largely to double date with Barbie and Ken and, on occasion, share their clothes. When Warner Bros. released the character posters for Gerwig&#8217;s film (out July 21), die-hard doll fans spotted two obscure dolls who were once mired in controversy, Midge and Allan. Played by Emerald Fennell and Michael Cera, Midge and Allan are Barbie and Ken&#8217;s best friends who made headlines after they got pregnant. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know.</p>\n<h2>Midge&#8217;s origin story</h2>\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643242415829184514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1643242415829184514%7Ctwgr%5E7a85c633a83fb04fcfbf7490444d61cff82232e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&#038;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fbarbie-movie-cast-posters-real-dolls.html\" >\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Emerald Fennell stars in Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s BARBIE </p>\n<p>Only in theaters July 21, 2023. <a href=\"https://t.co/lg5atvDKPz\"  target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/lg5atvDKPz</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643242415829184514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"  target=\"_blank\">April 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Midge was introduced in 1963 as Barbie&#8217;s bestie. Apparently, Barbie was <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CLASS/barbie/barb2.html\"  target=\"_blank\">getting some heat</a> for being &#8220;too sexy&#8221; at the time, so Midge was designed to be less sensual to combat the criticism&mdash;tough beat for Midge. What exactly made Midge more innocent looking was unclear. She had a rounder face and bangs and wore less eye makeup but otherwise looked pretty much the same as Barbie. In ads, Midge seems to third wheel on Barbie and Ken&#8217;s dates a lot. Again, not great to be Midge.</p>\n<p>Midge was retired in the &#8217;60s, but she made a comeback in the &#8217;80s. &#8220;California Dream&#8221; Midge wore a vest and looked like she walked off the set of <em>Saved by the Bell</em>. &#8220;Cool Times&#8221; Midge had voluminous &#8217;80s hair and an electric blue earrings.</p>\n<h2>Allan&#8217;s origin story</h2>\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643238276877410304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1643238276877410304%7Ctwgr%5E7a85c633a83fb04fcfbf7490444d61cff82232e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&#038;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fbarbie-movie-cast-posters-real-dolls.html\" >\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michael Cera stars in Greta Gerwig&rsquo;s BARBIE</p>\n<p>Only in theaters July 21, 2023. <a href=\"https://t.co/8jVjQeaEXx\"  target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/8jVjQeaEXx</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643238276877410304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"  target=\"_blank\">April 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Like Midge, Allan&#8217;s time in the limelight was shortlived. Launched in 1964 as &#8220;Ken&#8217;s buddy&#8221; Allan was around to offer emotional support and play Best Man at Barbie and Ken&#8217;s wedding. The big selling point was the two male dolls could share clothes. Mattel retired Allan after just a few years&mdash;but that&#8217;s marriage for you. Your old friends just sort of fall away.</p>\n<h2>Midge and Al(l)an&#8217;s wedding</h2>\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/LadyHawkins/status/1643706318539182080?s=20\" >\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Okay, I love that we&#39;re all citing the Deep Barbie Lore, but people saying Midge and Alan were discontinued in the 60s, ne&#39;er to return, are discounting my FAVORITE AND MOST PLAYED WITH BARBIE EVER, Wedding Day Midge! <a href=\"https://t.co/F1DZeY9UqZ\"  target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/F1DZeY9UqZ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Rachel Hawkins/Erin Sterling (@LadyHawkins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LadyHawkins/status/1643706318539182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"  target=\"_blank\">April 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Midge got married in the &#8217;90s in a Princess Di-esque dress to&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;Allan! Well, actually, she got married to Alan. Mattel dropped one of the Ls in the interning years. Barbie was a bridesmaid, obviously.</p>\n<h2>The Midge pregnancy controversy</h2>\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/sinntsn/status/1643335861461975040?s=20\" >\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">for those who don&rsquo;t know this Midge is an important part of history, she was sold pregnant and caused a huge controversy because parents were saying she was promoting teen pregnancy <a href=\"https://t.co/myg7aUnXUr\"  target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/myg7aUnXUr</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Sinn as Todd, Barbie&rsquo;s brother !

Technically, this was actually Midge&#8217;s second baby. She and Alan already had a three-year-old boy at home.</p>\n<p>Mattel announced that Midge was expecting a baby girl and released a version of the doll that allowed you to pop off Midge&#8217;s pregnant belly and find a baby curled up inside it. The company argued the doll could be a totally not awkward teaching tool for families&mdash;though we should note that that&#8217;s not how babies actually emerge from human bodies.</p>\n<p>Some Wal-Mart customers were reportedly none-too-pleased with the pregnant doll. Apparently they thought it promoted teen pregnancy, which is odd because Midge was a married adult, but whatever. <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2002/12/25/news/midge/\"  target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart pulled Midge from its shelves</a>, and Mattel produced a version with a flat belly and baby on the outside of her body.

Terry Williams, a Republican, and member of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many known toxic chemicals are used in or found as contaminants in personal care products, including PFAS, lead and formaldehyde,&#8221; Williams said in reporting the bill to Senate colleagues.</p>\n<p>California, Colorado and Maryland passed similar restrictions on cosmetics that go into effect in 2025. Other proposals are under consideration in Washington and Oregon while bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Rhode Island and Georgia.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, studies have linked PFAS exposure to increased cancer risk, developmental delays in children, damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid, increased cholesterol levels and reduced immune functions, especially among young children.</p>\n<p>Like in Colorado and California, the proposed Vermont crackdown on PFAS&mdash;known as &ldquo;forever chemicals&rdquo; for their persistence in the environment&mdash;goes beyond cosmetics. The bill, which now must be considered by the Vermont House, would extend the ban to apparel, including outdoor apparel for severe wet conditions, athletic turf, clothing, ski wax and textiles, including upholstery, draperies, towels and bedding that intentionally contain PFAS. It gives various timelines for the phaseouts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We must stop importing dangerous chemicals like PFAS into our state so we can prevent the harms they are causing up and down the supply chain &#8212; from their production and use to their disposal,&rdquo; Lauren Hierl, executive director of Vermont Conservation Voters, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>In March, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the <a href=\"https://time.com/6263222/pfas-water-epa/\" >first federal limits on the chemicals in drinking water</a>, saying the protection will save thousands of lives and prevent serious illnesses, including cancer. The chemicals had been used since the 1940s in consumer products and industry, including in nonstick pans, food packaging and firefighting foam. Their use is now mostly phased out in the U.S., but some still remain. Pressure is also growing to remove PFAS from food packaging.</p>\n<p>A study by University of Notre Dame researchers released in 2021 found that more than half the cosmetics sold in the United States and Canada were awash with a toxic industrial compound associated with serious health conditions.</p>\n<p>Researchers tested more than 230 commonly used cosmetics and found that 56% of foundations and eye products, 48% of lip products and 47% of mascaras contained fluorine&mdash;an indicator of PFAS.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says on its website that there have been few studies of the presence of PFAS in cosmetics, and the ones published found the concentration is at very low levels.</p>\n<p>The Personal Care Products Council, which represents the cosmetics industry, says in 2020 it supported California legislation to phase out certain ingredients, including 13 PFAS in cosmetics, and identical legislative language in Maryland the following year. The group called for states to pass uniform laws to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p>As for bans on apparel containing the chemicals, the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association supports the bill passed unanimously in the Vermont Senate and appreciates that amendments were made to align with phase-out timelines in existing PFAS restrictions in California and <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S1322\"  target=\"_blank\">New York</a>, said Chelsea Murtha, AAFA&rsquo;s director of sustainability, in a statement.</p>\n<p>The Outdoor Industry Association, based on Colorado, said overall it supports the Vermont bill, also noted the current version more closely matches the timeline for compliance with California&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are also appreciative of the exemption for outdoor apparel severe wet conditions until 2028, as our industry is diligently working to move toward non-regrettable alternatives that will not compromise consumer safety or the quality of the product,&rdquo; said president Kent Ebersole in a statement.</p>\n"

Brad Little signed a first-of-its-kind law Wednesday night that criminalizes any adult who helps a minor undergo an abortion through a procedure or medication in another state without parental consent. </span></p>\n<p>Under the law, adults would be facing felony charges and could be punished with two to five years in state prison for aiding with procuring an abortion, whether that be driving a minor across state lines, or helping them find an abortion provider out-of-state. Doctors who perform abortions would also be liable to criminal penalties. The law adds to the state&rsquo;s near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions unless a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest (which has to be reported to law enforcement), or is a life-saving measure.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proponents of the measure have heralded the law as a continuation of the state&rsquo;s right to ban abortions. &#8220;With the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s reversal of Roe vs. Wade last summer, the right and duty to establish legal policy on abortion was finally returned to our state democratic process,&#8221; Gov. Little </span><a href=\"https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/transmittal_h-242aaS_2023.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the Idaho legislature on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opponents warn that this law adds on to the continuous attacks against the bodily autonomy of youth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;If young people are unable to travel for care, they are forced to either self-manage an abortion and take on the potential legal risks, or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term along with the serious consequences that can have for their health and well-being,&rdquo; says Megan Darby, Director of State Policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization. &ldquo;Young people&mdash;along with everyone in Idaho and across the country&mdash;deserve compassionate and affordable access to the whole spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The law is set to go into effect in thirty days. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does the new law do? </span></h2>\n<p>The new law, formerly known as House Bill 242, criminalizes so-called &ldquo;abortion trafficking&rdquo; by making it illegal to obtain abortion pills for minors or help them leave the state to obtain an abortion, with the intent of hiding the abortion from a minor&rsquo;s parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>Under the law, the father, grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle of the unborn child has a right to sue an adult who helps a minor obtain an abortion up to four years after the abortion. The law also allows the specified family members to file lawsuits against out-of-state doctors who perform these abortions.</p>\n<p>The criminal ban does say that adults who help pregnant minors access abortions with the consent of parents/legal guardians have an affirmative defense. That means that if a defendant presents evidence that a minor&rsquo;s parent or guardian agreed the child could travel out-of-state for an abortion, they do not have criminal liability.</p>\n<p>The measure, however, says it is not an affirmative defense for an abortion provider or the provider of an abortion pill to be out of state. In other words, if a pregnant minor has a physician across state lines and obtains an abortion, that procedure is illegal.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violators can face anywhere from two to five years in state prison. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How would the law be implemented?</span></h2>\n<p>The passage of the law does not mean it&#8217;s necessarily popular with Idahoans. In a poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii but conducted by public opinion firm Lake Research Partners, nearly<a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-alliance-advocates/issues/idaho-opinion-research-health#:~:text=Forty%2Dfive%20percent%20of%20Idaho,remain%20legal%20in%20many%20circumstances.\"  target=\"_blank\"> half of all Idaho voters</a> reported being pro-choice, with 24% saying they think abortion should be generally available and only subject to &ldquo;limited regulation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;There&#8217;s been a movement among progressive prosecutors to say that they&#8217;re not going to prosecute some abortion offenses,&rdquo; says Cynthia Soohoo, Co-Director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at CUNY School of Law. &ldquo;But the law actually gives the Attorney General the power to enforce the law if local prosecutors don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of implementation, experts tell TIME, prosecutors would have to have substantial evidence that someone crossed state lines to access care. Because Idaho is between Washington and Oregon, where legislators are already working to enact shield protection laws, there is likely to be a conflict of state laws. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shield laws explicitly protect abortion providers from lawsuits if an out-of-state patient receives an abortion, but these laws also often protect &ldquo;helpers.&rdquo; The loose phrasing of the word helper applies to people who assist with the abortion, Elisabeth Smith, Director of State Policy and Advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights tells TIME that &ldquo;assistance could be anything [from] driving someone to the clinic, to providing financial assistance, to helping them make the appointment.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shield laws also prohibit that state from &ldquo;collaborating with any investigation that is about the provision of or assistance with reproductive health care,&rdquo; according to Smith. &ldquo;And so part of that prohibition on collaboration is a prohibition on subpoenas and providing evidence.&rdquo; In other words, states like Idaho would be unable to access medical records or other evidence of abortion care if neighboring states do pass shield laws, </span>making it difficult for a prosecutor to gather evidence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, it&#8217;s imperative that people who are seeking abortion care be private about their actions, Smith says. &ldquo;Thinking about how each of us share information, what information we put on social media, and what messaging services we use to share information [is critical] because again, none of these prosecutions can go forward without enough information to prove that someone has helped a young person access abortion,&rdquo; Smith tells TIME. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idaho&rsquo;s current abortion laws </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idaho&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/idaho/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">abortion ban</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash;which is modeled after a law in Texas&mdash;bars abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

Banning abortion wasn&rsquo;t enough for anti-abortion extremists in Idaho; they now want to ban where you go, what information you&rsquo;re legally allowed to obtain, and even what health care providers can say,&rdquo; Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/idaho-attorney-general-prohibits-out-of-state-referrals-for-abortion-health-care-providers-sue\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &ldquo;Attorney General Labrador&rsquo;s opinion is an egregious extension of Idaho&rsquo;s abortion ban. We won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to the rising number of anti-LGBTQ bills seen flooding state legislatures, Soohoo says it is very likely other conservative states will attempt to pass copycat laws, which would have similar provisions to Idaho&rsquo;s law. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;There is actually a long history of writing laws initially to challenge Roe vs. Wade or to limit access to abortion by conservative think tanks [that] draft these laws and then share them amongst state legislature[s].&rdquo; Soohoo tells TIME. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next for Idaho? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abortion access is likely to remain limited in the state after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

And <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">efforts to track the effects of the state&rsquo;s anti-abortion laws remain up in the air as the state&rsquo;s existing special committee that studies maternal deaths </span><a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/20/a-law-meant-to-save-lives-of-idaho-mothers-is-on-the-chopping-block-will-lawmakers-keep-it/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is set to end</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the national front, experts say that Congress needs to act, though their most recent attempts have not been fruitful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, House Democrats attempted to pass the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022 that would protect health care providers who provide abortion services to out-of-state residents, people who help pregnant people travel across state lines for an abortion, and more.

Working the refs, as it is, has never been so transparent. Talk to almost any operative working beyond the Beltway, and they&rsquo;ll tell you they have almost no one in the communities they are focused on who can take one of those suggested questions and run with it. That&rsquo;s why more of those &ldquo;tips&rdquo; have been coming in recent years to people like me.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>The fact that the national campaign committees are pitching opposition research on local candidates to reporters in Washington says more about the health of local journalism than their hopes of turning a rival into a late-night punching bag.</p>\n<p>This goes far beyond anecdotes, and as someone who is a Midwest transplant to D.C., I&rsquo;m particularly sensitive to how the persistent and pernicious decline of local journalism is disrupting that region.</p>\n<p>In a new paper <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/17/article/882956\"  target=\"_blank\">published</a> in the spring edition of <i>The Middle West Review</i>, historian Jon K. Lauck looks at the state of journalism in the Midwest states, and the topline observations are not reason for optimism for those who think a free and fair press is a vital component to the Jeffersonian notion of a well-informed electorate being a requisite component of a healthy democracy. In fact, the unspoken indictment is that the press&mdash;and its owners&mdash;are failing bigly in its part to help voters make the best choices possible.</p>\n<p>Take the well-regarded Omaha <i>World-Herald</i>, a towering newspaper that once <a href=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/03/08/buffett-stopped-loving-his-hometown-paper-but-still-makes-pocket-change-from-papers-he-sold/\"  target=\"_blank\">counted</a> local billionaire Warren Buffett as its owner. Lauck notes that the paper had more than 200 journalists in 2015 and started this year with about 40. The losses, of course, correspond to the decimation of readership: in 1980, the Sunday edition counted 302,000 copies rolling off its presses; these days, it&rsquo;s about 40,000. And, not for nothing, the Omaha coverage area historically has included a whole lot of western Iowa, a stretch where conservative candidates seeking the GOP presidential nomination have shaken-up that state&rsquo;s lead-off caucuses.</p>\n<p>The pattern continues throughout the region. For the Des Moines <i>Register</i>, arguably the most important voice in Iowa&rsquo;s political landscape, the Sunday run went from 535,000 copies in the 1970s down to 53,000 during 2020. The Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer </i>printed almost 500,000 copies on weekdays in the 1980s but ended 2019 with a daily circulation of about 95,000. All of these newsrooms are struggling with the fact that digital readers are not as profitable to them, and often not as engaged as the ones who used to subscribe to the print product. Down Interstate 71, The Columbus <i>Dispatch</i> has seen its coverage in the state&rsquo;s biggest city shrink from about 250 journalists in its late-1990s newsroom to about 40 these days. And then there&rsquo;s Youngstown, Ohio, where I started my journalism career. It&rsquo;s now the largest city in America <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/04/738724390/longtime-newspaper-to-shut-down-in-youngstown-ohio#:~:text=The%20Vindicator%20newspaper%20of%20Youngstown,nation%20without%20a%20major%20newspaper.\"  target=\"_blank\">without</a> its own stand-alone newspaper.</p>\n<p>The media landscape has changed over the last 20 years in vast ways, with online publishing and advertising threatening our business offices and assumptions in ways great and small. It&rsquo;s no secret that we as an industry have struggled to keep up. But beyond hollowed-out newsrooms or shuttered papers, the broader threat is one to democracy itself, one that will be more noticeable in 2024 than any previous election cycle. Without independent journalists to cover, analyze, and query candidates and their campaigns, voters are left to rely on the spin and propaganda that the political machines themselves churn out. Some of it is quite good, but none of it is self-critical. After all, Rep. George Santos arrived in Congress with very <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/george-santos-congress-scandal-campaign-finance-complete-coverage-uie3unwn\"  target=\"_blank\">little</a> friction blocking his acquisition of a voting card as a fabulist from New York. Without someone standing ready with a notebook, tape recorder (or iPhone app, as the case is nowadays), and just plain clear eyes on a candidate, voters aren&rsquo;t really getting the full picture.</p>\n<p>All this has me thinking back to my trip in late October to Ohio, where an open Senate race between Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance was drawing strong national interest. I had followed Ryan for some Thursday night tailgating at Bowling Green State, his alma mater.</p>\n<p>The late-October air was crisp, the beer outside the football stadium even chillier, the cornhole set up for undergrads and alumni alike. Ryan, coming off a busy day of campaigning, spent the evening tossing the football with his son and College Democrats, and making small talk with students who wandered by. In the distance, echoes of the marching band bounced off the benches in the stadium.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, such a pitch-perfect photo-op would have drawn a bevy of local political journalists trying to get a bead on a candidate&rsquo;s messaging and campaign style. But that night, there was only a single local online <a href=\"https://bgindependentmedia.org/tim-ryan-returns-to-his-alma-mater-bgsu-to-tailgate-with-voters/\"  target=\"_blank\">journalist</a>, a New York-based wire photographer, and the D.C.-based <a href=\"https://time.com/6228353/tim-ryan-ohio-trump-voters/\" >me</a>.</p>\n<p>This, of course, is not why Ryan lost his Senate race. No, there&rsquo;s been <a href=\"https://time.com/6227612/sherrod-brown-popularity-ohio-senate/\" >just one</a> Democrat who has won statewide office in Ohio in the last decade, and that&rsquo;s incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. Ohio&rsquo;s place as a <a href=\"https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/2008/06/16/obama-camp-sees-possible-win/52376074007/\"  target=\"_blank\">swing state</a> seems to be a thing of the past, although not everyone subscribes to that theory. No pictures of Ryan tossing a football with his son, Brady, would have narrowed his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/results/ohio/senate\"  target=\"_blank\">six-point</a> loss. (Though, for what it&rsquo;s worth, Joe Biden lost Ohio by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/ohio/\"  target=\"_blank\">eight points</a> two years earlier.)</p>\n<p>But when a major candidate in such a high-profile race is interacting with voters days before Election Day, the lack of curiosity from the local press corps, stemming in large part from its lack of bodies, speaks volumes about the larger difficulties of Ohioans getting a proper sense of their state&rsquo;s shifting political landscape.</p>\n<p>At the U.S. Capitol, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/media/amy-klobuchar-reliable-sources-big-tech-local-journalism/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\">championing</a> a bill to help local newsrooms compete for ad dollars against tech giants. As Klobuchar, a daughter of a newspaperman, knows, no one is better at interpreting local events than the people who live in those communities. The death of expertise is simultaneously bad for the newsrooms, but also voters.</p>\n<p>The political press doesn&rsquo;t always get it right&mdash;my Twitter replies are proof enough of that view&mdash;but it fills an important role in helping voters understand the issues and stakes of a campaign. Without that coverage, voters are left to listen to whichever candidates&rsquo; ads can dominate the airwaves and digital screens, most of it guided by the whims of deep-pocketed donors. That, put plainly, isn&rsquo;t what democracy should look like, especially not in a part of the country where hyper-local candidates can often defy national trends, if only someone credible is there to explain why.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sense of what matters in Washington. </span></i><a href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/signup?nln=dc-brief&amp;source=dc_onsite\" ><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for the D.C.

Stay in the zone too long and there&rsquo;s a danger of forgetting how to have a simple conversation or make a phone call, of going a little feral. Going into that inner wilderness is great, as long as we can follow the trail of bread crumbs back to the <a href=\"https://time.com/6269239/beef-ali-wong-steven-yeun/\" >world of human connection</a>.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s just one of the ideas at play in Kelly Reichardt&rsquo;s quietly extraordinary <i>Showing Up,</i> a movie so fine-grained that you&rsquo;re almost not prepared for the subtle power of its ending&mdash;the story is brought to land, almost literally, with the beating of wings. <a href=\"https://time.com/4549389/michelle-williams-interview-manchester-by-the-sea/\" >Michelle Williams</a> is Lizzy, a sculptor living in Portland, Ore., and getting ready to mount a small but, for her, important show. Before we even meet her, we see soft watercolor sketches of her ceramic works-in-progress, carefully molded figures of women of all ages who seem to be dancing, or weeping, or possibly both. These works are rounding the bend toward completion, and we watch as Lizzy scrutinizes them, tracing their now hardened contours, as if trying to reclaim with her fingers one last memory of the formerly soft clay. This, in movie form, is one idea of what it&rsquo;s like to make and think about art; its meaning can seem to pass through our skin, a mysterious vibration.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>But like all artists Lizzy is also, whether she wants to be or not, a person living in the world. She has a small studio and living space that she rents from her closest friend, Jo (the <a href=\"https://time.com/6259203/oscar-nominees-to-watch-2023/\" >remarkable Hong Chau</a>), also an artist, with a personality as breezy as Lizzy&rsquo;s is thorny: though she too is preparing a local show&mdash;two, in fact&mdash;she&rsquo;s happy to spend any spare time she&rsquo;s got installing a tire swing in the backyard of her small apartment building, rather than addressing the more immediate problem presented by Lizzy&rsquo;s broken hot-water heater. Lizzy watches, her brow a tiny thundercloud, as Jo twirls in her newly installed swing, living the idea of what we want an artist&rsquo;s life to be. Everything about Lizzy is coiled tight: What about her hot water? What about <i>her</i> needs? She&rsquo;s preparing a show too. She stands there, sullen but also perplexed, her arms dangling in her shapeless cotton clothes like a Roz Chast cartoon come to life.</p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img

Up&#8217;</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is the magic of Williams&rsquo; performance, playing a woman whose art demands deep inner travel, but whose movement through the everyday world could use some improvement. Retreating into the world of her &ldquo;girls,&rdquo; as others refer to her sculptures, is less bewildering to Lizzy than the real life she&rsquo;s stuck with. She has a dull day job in a small arts college run by her mother Jean (Maryann Plunkett); her father Bill (Judd Hirsch), once a prolific ceramicist, has retreated into a world of flaky hippiedom. She&rsquo;s also consumed with worry about her brother Sean (played superbly by John Magaro). He may be the biggest genius of the whole gang, but he&rsquo;s also the most fragile, a semilost soul whose clumsy manners belong to another world.</p>\n<p>Lizzy has more moderate problems too: it&rsquo;s her cat, Ricky, a small orange jerk, who sets the plot in motion with a flick of his paw. Lizzy is bedeviled by all of it, and Williams, a formidable actor, channels her annoyance like a subsonic hum. This is the fourth movie she and Reichardt have made together. They&rsquo;re simpatico souls; Reichardt (who also co-wrote the script, with her frequent collaborator Jonathan Raymond) couldn&rsquo;t have made a movie as weird and great and intimate as this one with just anybody. The <a href=\"https://time.com/6182784/cannes-film-festival-movies-significance/\" >on-the-surface modesty</a> of <i>Showing Up</i> is a kind of sorcery. It&rsquo;s in the days afterward, when you&rsquo;ve left its spell and gone back to the world, that its essence is more likely to take shape&mdash;a shape you could almost trace with your thumb, as if it were made of clay and not images, air, and feeling.</p>\n"

And for many, the answer is terrifying: across the frontlines and scattered across Russia, a 6.6 million square mile country that has invaded their homeland. This is the result, Ukraine and international observers say, of a systematic effort at the highest levels of the Russian government to separate Ukrainian children from their families and their identity as Ukrainians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Russia has contended that it has relocated children in an effort to protect them, it does not appear to be making an effort to reunite the children with their parents. Instead, observers say, it appears to be working to erase their identity through re-education and integration into Russian families. </span><br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These accusations have led the International Criminal Court to <a href=\"https://time.com/6264280/vladimir-putin-icc-warrant-arrest/\" >charge Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> with <a href=\"https://time.com/6266991/ukraine-push-putin-war-crimes/\" >violations of international law</a>, alongside </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the Commissioner for Children&rsquo;s Rights&mdash;who adopted a Ukrainian child herself and is thought to be leading the program. Such crimes against children, some experts say, <a href=\"https://time.com/6262903/russia-ukraine-genocide-war-crimes/\" >may even be evidence of genocide</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are unable to rescue their children themselves must turn to others for help, including the charity Save Ukraine. Founded in 2014, the NGO has helped about 90,000 people escape the conflict in the last year. It also provided many families with short and long-term shelter and rehabilitation services to help them rebuild their lives, including trauma therapy, education and job services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Save Ukraine launched an even more daunting project: rescuing Ukrainian children who have been taken into Russia and Russian-occupied territory, says Save Ukraine&rsquo;s founder, Mykola Kubela, who served as the children&rsquo;s ombudsman for the president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2021. Traveling by plane or bus, it has shepherded dozens of desperate relatives through Poland and Belarus to circumvent the front lines and then into enemy territory. Over the last year the group says they&#8217;ve brought 95 children home from Russia and Russian-occupied territory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kuleba, while there are still thousands of children to be saved, their work is only becoming more difficult. A Ukrainian</span><a href=\"https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">national database</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has identified over 19,000 children who have been deported to Russia, and the locations of thousands more is unknown. And as time goes by, Kuleba says that children are becoming harder to find as Russia works to erase their identities, including by placing them in adoptive families and changing their names.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuleba spoke to TIME in March from a Save the Children&rsquo;s shelter in Kyiv&mdash;where 200 women and children are currently living&mdash;about the obstacles his organization faces rescuing thousands of others.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. </span></i></p>\n<h3>TIME: How do you bring children back from Russia?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kubela: It is a very complicated process. It&#8217;s very hard to find these children if they are in Russia. They try to hide the children, or they send the children to Russian families to adopt them, place them under guardianship or foster care.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just yesterday, we returned one child&mdash;a 14-year-old boy, Konstantin&mdash;from Anapa, in Russia. He was abducted from occupied territory in the Kherson region; he&rsquo;d been in a reeducation camp for several months. The Russians said they will not return him, and if nobody comes, he will be adopted. He only had a father, but he&rsquo;s very sick, and he had several sisters, and they were afraid to go to Russia. They&rsquo;re a very poor family, and they had to spend thousands of dollars to cross several borders to reach Anapa.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?w=560&w=560\" alt=\"RUSSIA-POLITICS-RIGHTS\" srcset=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg 1024w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=768,491 768w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=600,383 600w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=550,351 550w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=280,179 280w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=560,358 560w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=419,268 419w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=838,535 838w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=407,260 407w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=814,520 814w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=190,121 190w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=380,243 380w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=263,168 263w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=526,336 526w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=61,39 61w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=640,409 640w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=760,485 760w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=700,447 700w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=1000,639 1000w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=49,31 49w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=840,536 840w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=1012,646 1012w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=320,204 320w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=730,466 730w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=192,123 192w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=391,250 391w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=479,306 479w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=958,612 958w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=767,490 767w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=800,511 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Mikhail Metzel&mdash;Sputnik/AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=\"caption\" >Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Maria Lvova-Belova, Russian children&#8217;s rights commissioner, at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, on February 16, 2023.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[His 18-year-old sister] was in a group of mothers and relatives that rescued 17 children. [She] successfully reached the facility, and we helped her to negotiate there. He had been in a foster family for two weeks. They brainwashed him, and when she found him, he told her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to return to Ukraine. My parents told me that if I return back, Ukrainian Nazis will kill me because I was in Russia.&rdquo; He told her, &ldquo;if I agree to receive status as an orphan, the Russian government will help me. They will give me a flat; they will keep giving me money; they will put me in a technical school.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She worked with him for three days. She told him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. I&rsquo;m your sister, your father is dying. He wants to be with you.&rdquo; She worked with him for three days to convince him that he can successfully and safely return to Ukraine. And just yesterday, they crossed the border. </span></p>\n<h3>What kind of obstacles do you face?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the time, we have to change our routes, because every time, the Russians try to block our missions. We do it differently every time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&rsquo;t tell you a lot, but we have guys who were arrested in Belarus. It&rsquo;s very dangerous for anybody who tries to help anything having to do with Ukrainians there. That&#8217;s why we have to carefully plan our missions, because it could be very dangerous for these mothers and for children, or for any people who can provide support.</span></p>\n<h3>How do you locate children in Russian territory?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use different tools. First of all, we have a hotline through which we receive information from people who are in Ukraine or abroad. Because we&rsquo;re the biggest NGO in Ukraine who provides rescue missions, rescuing people from combat zones, many people know us and send us information about children who were deported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very often, the children who were returned report to us about other children who stayed in their facilities in Russia or Crimea, and then we find their relatives. Or, when relatives ask us to find a child, we find them through other children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just two hours ago, I talked with a journalist who told me she knows the father of a boy being held in a facility in Russia. We recognized information about that boy&mdash;we just returned another child from the facility who knew the boy was being held there, and they&rsquo;re communicating through social media. Our next steps will be to communicate with the father, and take him on our next rescue mission. And to return that boy from the Russian Federation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very many children who are staying in Russia don&rsquo;t know where their parents are. We try to find their parents, but they could be in occupied territories, or in the Russian Federation, or they could have been killed. Or imprisoned. They could be in filtration camps. Sometimes we know information about the child, but we don&#8217;t know anything about the parents.</span></p>\n<h3>Does paperwork pose a problem?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. For example, we prepare international passports for all these parents. For many of them, it&rsquo;s their first trip to Russia or to Europe&mdash;because we go through Poland, Belarus. They are very poor families, and very often, they have no documents. That&rsquo;s why we have to help them to receive documents for a child, and receive legal permission from different government organizations. Without documents, it&rsquo;s impossible to bring a child back.</span></p>\n<h3>If children are orphans, or if you can&rsquo;t find their parents, are you thinking about ways to bring them back in the future?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s a very hard question. Last year, Putin signed legislation in May which simplifies receiving Russian citizenship, to simplify the procedure of adoption. Through the adoption process, Russia can change the last name and date of birth of any child to give them Russian citizenship. After that, the child can disappear in Russia&mdash;especially little kids. That&#8217;s why we have to hurry to return them to Ukraine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is our goal to raise awareness about what Russia is doing with our children, with our families, how they try to destroy Ukrainian identity and Russify our children. It is genocide.</span></p>\n<h3>What do you think the world needs to do to bring the children home?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, to help us to fight with Russia, to de-occupy our territories, to clean our land from Russia. Second&mdash;the ICC&rsquo;s decision on President Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova was a very good sign for us, because it was the beginning of the process of punishing them as war criminals. After that, maybe we will receive our children back, and they will be returned.</span></p>\n"
