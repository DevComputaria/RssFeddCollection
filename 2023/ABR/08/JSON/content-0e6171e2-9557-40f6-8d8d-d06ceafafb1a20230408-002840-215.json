                        "#cdata-section": "<p>Federal judges in Texas and Washington on Friday issued dueling rulings that intensified the legal battle over abortion and a commonly used medical abortion drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legal battle over the pill mifepristone has grown more intense since the US Supreme Court last year tossed out the federal right to the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abortion pill was at the center of two conflicting federal court rulings on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one ruling, a federal judge in Texas halted Food and Drug Administration approval of the abortion pill, pending a seven-day window to give the Justice Department time to appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Friday night, in a dramatic lurch in a different legal direction, a federal judge in Washington state said that the FDA must keep the abortion pill available in at least 12 liberal states.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is background on the abortion pill and its use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How widespread is abortion pill use?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Guttmacher Institute, the pill accounted for more than half -- 53 percent -- of the 930,160 abortions documented by the reproductive health research and policy organization in the United States in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was up from 17 percent in 2008 and 39 percent in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the number of so-called medication abortions has gone up dramatically in the United States in recent years, it is still not as prevalent as in several European nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In France, for example, medication abortions represented 70 percent of the total number of abortions in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abortion pill is different from the \"morning after\" pill, which is taken by a woman after sexual intercourse to prevent becoming pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abortion pill is taken to induce an abortion once a woman confirms that she is pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It in fact involves more than one pill. The first, mifepristone, also known as RU 486, stops a pregnancy from proceeding normally by blocking production of the hormone progesterone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another drug, misoprostol, is taken up to 48 hours later and causes cramps, bleeding and the emptying of the uterus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abortion pills can be used at home and a medical setting is not required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When was the abortion pill approved?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light to mifepristone and misoprostol in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, after which a woman would need to undergo an abortion through another means such as vacuum aspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average cost of a medication abortion at Planned Parenthood is $580 but it can cost up to $800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it safe and effective?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of the abortion pill during the specified time period is considered to be safe and effective by medical experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregnancies are successfully terminated in more than 95 percent of cases where the pill is used, according to studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serious complications -- excessive bleeding, fever, infection or allergic reaction -- which require a medical consult, are rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abortion pill does not work for ectopic pregnancies, which account for around two percent of all pregnancies and where a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where is the pill available?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 13 US states have banned most abortions, including medication abortions, since the Supreme Court's ruling in June overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the bans, a number of organizations have mobilized to provide abortion pills to women in states where abortion is restricted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extent of their efforts is difficult to evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the states where abortion is legal, the FDA recently loosened restrictions surrounding mifepristone, allowing it to be sent through the mail with a prescription or to be sold directly in pharmacies like any other drug.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>"

The bodies will be handed over to their families after the autopsy, reported Dhaka Tribune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locals said they heard on-and-off gunshots from Thursday evening till Friday morning. They claimed the gunfight took place between KNF and United People's Democratic Front (UPDF-reformist).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on an inspection of their clothes, the deceased are believed to be members of the Kuki Chin National Army (KNA), the armed wing of the KNF. It is suspected that the opposition armed group took heavy weapons that the deceased were carrying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KNF in a social media post claimed that just seven people were killed in the gunfight. They blamed a reformist group for the incident, without mentioning any name, reported Dhaka Tribune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the KNF is the armed wing of the Kuki Chin National Front, that harbours separatist demands, the original UPDF under Prasit Khisa has in the past stated 'full autonomy' for the CHT districts as its principal demand. Its official position on the CHT Accord signed between the government of Bangladesh and the PCJSS in 1997, has been 'skeptical'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDF (Democratic) has never clarified its position or distanced itself from the original founding principles. Their reasons for splintering are thought to be personality-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deaths reported on Thursday are the highest in an armed incident in the area since the July 2020 incident, reported Dhaka Tribune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 12 this year, a senior army warrant officer was killed and two other soldiers suffered injuries when members of KNA opened fire on a patrol team in Rowangchhari upazila of Bandarban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 15, KNF members abducted nine people, including Sergeant (Retd) Anwar Hossain, while they were working on the road in the Longthasi Jhiri area of Ruma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a message on March 18, the KNF claimed that 30 people from the Bom community were detained by the joint forces from September 9 till March, and demanded their release, reported Dhaka Tribune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Thursday's incident, some 175 families in the neighbourhood have taken refuge in Rowangchhari Government High School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manik Khiang, a shopkeeper in the Khamtam neighbourhood, said: \"There was a shooting incident between two groups on Thursday evening. At that time, many people left their homes in fear. So far, I have learned that more than 50 families have left their homes. Many of them have taken refuge in nearby educational institutions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since November 15 last year, at least 548 people from 132 families have taken refuge in Mizoram. On January 28, some 140 Marma women, men and children took refuge in Ruma Sadar from Mulpi Para, but they returned to their homes on February 5, reported Dhaka Tribune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 10, around 220 people of 56 families from Barathli 4 Union of Rangamati's Bilaichhari took shelter in Tangchangya Reichha and Rowangchhari Sadar Upazila in fear of the armed activities by KNF members.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>"

Her primary duties included taking care of her employer's twin babies, as well as household chores.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 26, 2022, Ms Masita's employer left home to pick up her older daughter from preschool. Ms Masita was left at home with the twin infants, who were aged 14 months at the time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is when the maid attempted to put them to sleep, however, after about a half-hour, she lost patience with one of the babies because she thought the victim was keeping her from preparing dinner. Ms Masita then bit the little girl once on her left forearm, leaving a bruise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the child's mother returned home about half an hour later, she went to cook dinner for her children and fed them. While preparing the baby girl for bed, the mother saw a bruise in the shape of a bite mark on the baby's arm. The woman suspected that Ms Masita had bitten the little girl and questioned her about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/feature/canadian-man-chronicles-his-weight-loss-journey-it-started-after-a-conversation-with-daughter-3929897\" target=\"_self\">Canadian Man Chronicles His Weight Loss Journey. It Started After A Conversation With Daughter</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 33-year-old initially denied doing so but eventually acknowledged her behaviour. According to The Straits Times, Ms Masita even knelt down and apologised to her employer, but the child's mother reported the matter to the police.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prosecutor claimed that the victim was particularly vulnerable and especially young, and Ms Masita had abused the position of trust she was placed in. According to him, Ms Masita hurt the victim \"willfully,\" and the offence was committed because she was upset that the victim wasn't nodding off as quickly as she would have liked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>District Judge Tan Jen Tse also observed that Ms Masita had committed the offence out of annoyance in a singular instance of abuse involving a single act and had shown regret shortly after. The judge agreed to Ms Masita's request to postpone her sentence for a week so she could put her affairs in order, including contacting her family in Indonesia over arrangements for her return after her imprisonment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 33-year-old is now expected to surrender herself at the State Courts on Tuesday in order to begin serving her sentence.&nbsp;</p>"

It was the first time a Taiwan president had met a US Speaker on American soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China views any official exchanges between foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on Beijing's claims of sovereignty over the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California would be banned from any cooperation, exchange or transaction with institutions and individuals in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley was the site where Tsai met McCarthy and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders. It was the second high-profile meeting between an American official and Taiwan's president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China also sanctioned the Hudson Institute, which hosted an event and presented Tsai with its global leadership award on March 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sanctioned groups included Asia-based groups --The Prospect Foundation and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats for their involvement in promoting Taiwan's independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"[The] Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests. The Chinese government and Chinese people will never agree to anyone making a fuss about the one-China issue,\" President Xi told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a meeting in Beijing on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was his first comment after the US House Speaker McCarthy met Tsai, which Beijing sharply criticised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Anyone who expects China to compromise on the Taiwan question could only be wishful thinking and self-defeating,\" Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to reporters after the meeting, von der Leyen said the Taiwan issue had been discussed and she had told Xi that \"the threat to use force to change the status quo is unacceptable. It is important that some of the tensions that might occur should be resolved through dialogue\", Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday's sanctions, the foreign ministry in Beijing said that both American institutions were banned from having exchanges, cooperation, and other activities with any individuals, universities or institutions in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We want to stress China will take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a media briefing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also sought to dismiss a question on how Beijing can integrate Taiwan, which follows a multiple-party democratic system with that of China's one-party rule headed by the ruling Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwan question is not about democracy but about China's territorial integrity and reunification and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, Mao said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and will never be divided,\" she asserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Some countries support Taiwan in the name of democracy and use the Taiwan question to contain China. This move is dangerous and gets nowhere. Taiwan's future lies in the development of cross-strait relations and reunification with the mainland,\" she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference in systems is not a barrier to reunification or an excuse for division, Mao said and advocated the 'one country-two systems' formula which Beijing sought to apply to Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peaceful reunification and the 'one country two systems' take Taiwan's realities into full account and help to achieve peace and stability after re-unification, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It is the basic principle to resolving the Taiwan question and the best way for realising reunification,\" she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sanctions came a day after China vowed reprisals against Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China and the US also flexed their naval might by deploying aircraft carriers in a rare showdown in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under its longstanding \"One China\" policy, the US acknowledges China's position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognised Beijing's claim to the island of 23 million. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, it is also bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Taiwan's foreign ministry on Friday said the head of state of the Republic of China (Taiwan) exercises a basic right of a sovereign nation when travelling to other countries to engage in diplomatic activities. China has no right to intervene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"China is overreacting when it uses this as a pretext to further suppress Taiwan's international space and impose so-called sanctions on related individuals and organisations. Such irrational behaviour not only increases the Taiwanese people's antipathy to China but also exposes the erratic and absurd nature of the communist regime,\" Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>"

The packaging for daily-use products is not even imaginable without plastic wrapping. An environmental crisis has been brought on by years of excessive use and a rise in single-use, disposable plastics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers, developers, and scientists have been attempting to create new eco-friendly and simple processes for producing plastic. In the quest for solutions, recent research has achieved a breakthrough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new type of plastic has just been created by researchers at <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg2295\" target=\"_blank\">Boise State University</a> in the US that, unlike other plastics, is not made from crude oil and its byproducts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2365324-recyclable-plastic-made-from-super-glue-could-replace-polystyrene/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New Scientist</em>, </a>Allison Christy and Scott Phillips at Boise State University in Idaho used ethyl cyanoacrylate-the main ingredient in super glue-to create a plastic that could replace polystyrene, which is commonly used in yoghurt pots, disposable cups, and cutlery and accounts for 6 percent of plastic waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientists explained the process, saying ethyl cyanoacrylate can be made from formaldehyde, which in turn can be made from carbon dioxide. When super glue is exposed to moisture, ethyl cyanoacrylate molecules bond to form polymer chains, but the reaction is so fast that you only get short chains. The researchers created a way to slow that process down in order to form longer polymer chains and therefore a stronger material, known as poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate), or PECA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/pga/73/plastics/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a>, up to 12 million tonnes of plastic are being swept into the oceans annually, and gyres, or so-called 'islands of plastic', are blossoming. While most plastics are expected to remain intact for decades or centuries after use, those that do erode end up as micro-plastics, which are consumed by fish and other marine wildlife and quickly make their way into the global food chain. Indeed, micro-plastics have been found everywhere, from the Arctic to the Swiss mountains, in tap water, and in human faeces.</p>"
