We decided to put these chatbots through their paces with an assortment of tasks to determine which one reigns supreme in the AI chatbot arena. Since Bing Chat uses similar <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/\">GPT-4</a> technology as the latest ChatGPT model, we opted to focus on two titans of AI chatbot technology: OpenAI and Google.</p>\n\n<p>We tested ChatGPT and Bard in seven critical categories: dad jokes, argument dialog, mathematical word problems, summarization, factual retrieval, creative writing, and coding. For each test, we fed the exact same instruction (called a \"prompt\") into ChatGPT (with GPT-4) and Google Bard. We used the first result, with no cherry-picking.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that a version of ChatGPT based on the earlier <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/openai-conquers-rhyming-poetry-with-new-gpt-3-update/\">GPT-3.5</a> model is also available, but we did not use that in the test. Since we used GPT-4 only, we will refer to ChatGPT as \"ChatGPT-4\" in this article to reduce confusion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928609#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928609&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/clash-of-the-ai-titans-chatgpt-vs-bard-in-a-showdown-of-wits-and-wisdom/feed/","slash:comments":"216"},{"title":"Open garage doors anywhere in the world by exploiting this “smart” device","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929120","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/open-garage-doors-anywhere-in-the-world-by-exploiting-this-smart-device/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Dan Goodin"},"pubDate":"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 22:30:15 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"garage door"},{"#cdata-section":"Internet of things"},{"#cdata-section":"iot"},{"#cdata-section":"nexx"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929120"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"A universal password.

Rather than relying on TCP-based technologies such as FTP to move files, Aspera uses IBM’s proprietary FASP—short for Fast, Adaptive, and Secure Protocol—to better utilize available network bandwidth. The product also provides fine-grained management that makes it easy for users to send files to a list of recipients in distribution lists or shared inboxes or workgroups, giving transfers a workflow that’s similar to email.</p>\n<p>In late January, IBM <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6952319\">warned</a> of a critical vulnerability in Aspera versions 4.4.2 Patch Level 1 and earlier and urged users to install an update to patch the flaw. Tracked as CVE-2022-47986, the vulnerability makes it possible for unauthenticated threat actors to remotely execute malicious code by sending specially crafted calls to an outdated programming interface. The ease of exploiting the vulnerability and the damage that could result earned CVE-2022-47986 a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927511#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927511&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ransomware-crooks-are-exploiting-ibm-file-exchange-bug-with-a-9-8-severity/feed/","slash:comments":"26"},{"title":"Generative AI set to affect 300 million jobs across major economies","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927270","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/generative-ai-set-to-affect-300-million-jobs-across-major-economies/#comments","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Financial Times"},"pubDate":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:30:49 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Biz & IT"},{"#cdata-section":"Policy"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"},{"#cdata-section":"automation"},{"#cdata-section":"employment"},{"#cdata-section":"syndication"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927270"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Technology could boost global GDP by 7% but also risks creating \"significant disruption.\""},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/empty-office-800x563.jpg\" alt=\"Empty cubicles in office\">\n      <p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/empty-office-scaled.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1803\" data-width=\"2560\">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businesswoman-standing-alone-in-empty-office-royalty-free-image/102871188\">Thomas Barwick via Getty</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence could lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone, according to research by Goldman Sachs.</p>\n<p>The investment bank said on Monday that “generative” AI systems such as ChatGPT, which can create content that is indistinguishable from human output, could spark a productivity boom that would eventually raise annual global gross domestic product by 7 percent over a 10-year period.</p>\n<p>But if the technology lived up to its promise, it would also bring “significant disruption” to the labor market, exposing the equivalent of 300 million full-time workers across big economies to automation, according to Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, the paper’s authors.
