C2A\nSecurity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in:\nJerusalem, Israel</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C2A Security is\nan automotive cybersecurity lifecycle management platform that was founded in\n2016. The perimeter cybersecurity protection, in-vehicle network security, and\nembedded runtime protection are all C2A products. A Cybersecurity Management\nSystem is provided by C2A Security (CSMS). C2A released AutoSec, a suite of\ncybersecurity products, in October 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Original\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs), tier-1 suppliers, and the entire automotive\nsupply chain benefit from AutoSec&#8217;s full-spectrum visibility and security. It\nalso improves supply chain communication, automates threat modelling and\ndetection, and minimises vulnerability reaction time. The platform quickly\nintegrates security policy updates into embedded systems and controls risks\nthroughout vehicle lifecycles thanks to its flexible and open ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new ISO/SAE\n21434 standard, as well as the new UNECE WP.29 rule, are both met by AutoSec.\nIn April 2020, C2A became an AUTOSAR development partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Connected Car Cybersecurity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A connected car\nis one that can communicate with other systems outside of the vehicle in both\ndirections (LAN). This enables the car to exchange internet connection and, as\na result, data with other devices both inside and outside the vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connected\nvehicles, in conjunction with other upcoming vehicular technologies such as\nautomated driving, electric automobiles, and shared mobility, are helping to\ncreate a new type of future mobility: autonomous, connected, electric, and\nshared vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A vehicle can\nconnect to its surroundings and communicate with them in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(V2I) Vehicle\nto Infrastructure Connectivity:</strong> This technology collects\ndata from the vehicle and gives the driver with information on the\ninfrastructure. Information concerning safety, mobility, or environmental\nconditions is communicated using V2I technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(V2V) Vehicle\nto Vehicle connectivity</strong>: This technology uses a\nwireless exchange of data to relay information about the speed and location of\nnearby vehicles. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion, avoid accidents, and\nhave a positive impact on the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(V2C) Vehicle\nto Cloud Connectivity</strong>: This technology communicates\nwith a cloud system information about and for vehicle applications. This\nenables the car to access data from other cloud-connected industries, such as\nenergy, transit, and smart homes, which all make use of IoT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While linked\ncars provide consumers with numerous benefits, manufacturers and suppliers must\nevaluate what connected cars represent for consumer privacy and security. As\nmore connected automobiles hit the road, malevolent hackers will be able to\nexploit software flaws via cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and hard-line connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers&#8217; ability\nto get illegal remote access to the vehicle network and undermine vital safety\nsystems puts not just users&#8217; personal information at danger, but also their\nphysical safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle manufacturers\nmust implement a cybersecurity strategy that covers not only visible\nvulnerabilities in their vehicles&#8217; software, but also hidden vulnerabilities\npresented by open source [or third-party] components.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-cybersecurity-vendors-for-cars/\">Top Cybersecurity vendors for Cars</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-cybersecurity-vendors-for-cars/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Which region has the cheapest EV charging prices in America?","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/which-region-has-the-cheapest-ev-charging-prices-in-america/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/which-region-has-the-cheapest-ev-charging-prices-in-america/#respond","pubDate":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 06:07:01 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"360Quadrants"},{"#cdata-section":"ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging station"},{"#cdata-section":"charging cost for electric cars"},{"#cdata-section":"Charging System"},{"#cdata-section":"cheapest EV charging"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging companies"},{"#cdata-section":"ev charging station business"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging stations"},{"#cdata-section":"free EV charging"},{"#cdata-section":"type of charging port"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2927"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>As evident, the US is one of the major contributors to EV sales globally and is growing linearly in the EV market since 2015.

However, not all states share an equal\ndistribution of technology. As per the data given by National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory (last updated June 2021), <strong>California has the maximum number of\nEVs, contributing to 42% of the total nationwide</strong>. While Florida has the\nsecond-highest number of EVs followed by Texas, Washington, New York City, New\nJersey, and Arizona. It was noted that California has a total of 42,550 public\nand private EVSE ports and Florida has 7,393 charging ports. From the data\navailable, the year 2021 showed a rapid increase in the number of charging stations\nwhich grew by 55%. Many US states have laws and incentives related to the use\nof electric vehicles which makes the EV adoption rate to be completely\ndifferent across all the 50 states.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cheapest-EV-charging.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2928\"/><figcaption><em>Figure 1: From Left to Right – Number of Level 1 Chargers, Level 2 Chargers, and DC Fast Chargers</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is well known that even though the\ncountry is governed by federal law, the states are responsible for their own\ngoverning and decisions, which also include decisions pertaining to the expansion\nof the charging vehicle infrastructure. It is evident that not all the states\nare well equipped with charging facilities. Some states like California and\nFlorida have adopted EV technology and have set net-zero emissions goals for\n2025, while the other states have not expanded in the technology as the sales\nfor ICE vehicles have been dominant over the electric vehicles and hence taking\nthe slower route for the EVCS deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new EV infrastructure bill passed by the American government, the US is expected to have around 15 million electric vehicles by 2030. This huge increase is fueled by the decarbonization and net-zero emissions target of the government. Several prominent companies such as Tesla, Electrify America, and ChargePoint are also aggressively making moves to expand their <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">charging infrastructure</a> across American states. These initiatives involve the deployment of more Level 2 chargers as compared to the DC fast chargers along with other charging infrastructure and software upgrades. However, merely adding a large number of Level 2 chargers instead of Level 3 DC fast chargers will not be a correct pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different levels of EV Charging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of charging levels,\nnamely Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3based on the output power levels. A vast\nmajority of the charging stations across the country are Level 2 chargers,\naccounting for 80% of total chargers. While Level 1 and Level 3 comprise 5% and\n15% of the total chargers respectively. The primary reason for such a\ndistribution is the low power level of Level 1 chargers and high pricing of the\nDC fast chargers, due to which the EV users are more deviated to using the\nLevel 2 chargers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Alternative Fuels Data Center, there\nare currently 43,163 Level 2 chargers and 6,286 DC fast chargers, and only 285\nLevel 1 chargers. Most of the EVs across the US are compatible to charge with\nLevel 1 and Level 2 charging equipment. To address the rapid charging needs of\nthe EVs for long runs most EV manufacturers now ensure to make it compatible\nwith the CCS connectors which allow the EV charging to be compatible with all\nlevels of charging. The Tesla vehicles come with a J1772 adapter, which allows\nthem to use non-Tesla charging equipment spread across the US. It additionally\nprovides an adapter for its users to connect with the CHAdeMO adapter. These\ncharging levels can be explained as below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 1 Chargers:</strong> This charging is typically used at homes where 120V AC outlets are\navailable. Since most of the EVs come with a portable Level 1 cord set,\ntherefore no additional equipment is required and can be installed easily. It\nusually takes 8 hours of charging at 120 V to work for about 40 miles of\nelectric range for a mid-sized electric vehicle. These chargers have a minimum\npricing structure and usually come along with the EV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 2 Chargers:</strong> It is the most common type of charging observed in residential\nbuildings. It offers charging through a 240 V or 208 V AC outlet and can\noperate at up to 80 amps and 19.2 kW. The level 2 chargers need a constant dedicated\n40-Amp circuit to work in accordance with the National Electric Code\nrequirements in Article 625. However, most of the residential equipment\noperates at lower power ratings, therefore many of these units operate at up to\n30 Amps, delivering 7.2 kW of power while charging the vehicle overnight. These\nLevel 2 chargers are easy to use and can be installed at home and have a\nreasonable pricing structure when compared to the DC chargers. They are also a\npreferred choice for workplaces, shopping malls, public charging places, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 3 Chargers:</strong> DC fast chargers also called Level 3 chargers operate at high power\nvalues such as 250 kW and above. These chargers are mostly found in the heavy\ntraffic corridors at installed stations. There are three types of DC fast\ncharging systems based on the type of charging port on the vehicle namely, SAE\nCombined Charging System (CCS), CHAdeMO, and Tesla. The CCS connectors used are\nunique in the application as they can be used for all three types of charging\nlevels, the only difference is DC fast charging connectors have two additional\nbottom pins. The only setback with the DC fast chargers is the high installation\nand maintenance costs, which hinders its expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Miles per hour of charging time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The charging time for an EV can be as long\nas 8 to 12 hours and as short as 15 to 30 mins only depending on the type of\ncharger used. A typical electric car has a 60-kWh battery that can be charged\nfrom zero to 100% within a duration of 8 hours using the 6.6 kW charging power\nor can be charged under 30 mins by using a rapid DC fast charger. These DC fast\nchargers are the fastest way to add up to 60 to 200 miles of range by mere\ncharging the EV for 30 mins or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Level 1 chargers are very slow, adding nearly 5 miles of range per hour as compared to the Level 2 chargers which can add up to 25 miles of range per hour, therefore the EV drivers tend more towards using the Level 2 charging. For the DC fast charging, although it can speed up the charging process and can add up several miles, not all the EVs are compatible with such high-power values and therefore the chargers are less in number, comprising only 15% of the total public charging ports across the US.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wptb-table-container wptb-table-2926\"><div class=\"wptb-table-container-matrix\"><table

Comparison Table of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 chargers</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which region is the cheapest for EV charging across the\nUS? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“What will be the charging cost for the electric car?” &#8211; </strong>This is the most asked question by EV users and new adopters of the technology and can only be answered by a thorough evaluation of the geography and the policies adopted by the region. The charging cost for electric cars in America depends on various factors such as geography, connectors, power consumed, charging time, type of battery, and many other such factors. In order to understand which US region has the cheapest <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charging price</a>, it can be understood by the monthly electricity rates and the number of charging points in the vicinity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the number of charging ports, it\nis evident that California and Florida have the maximum number of charging\nports. However, the cost of electricity varies in different states of the US.\nFor instance, In the residential areas of California and New York have rates as\nhigh as 26.71 and 19.74 cents per kWh respectively, while states like Florida,\nUtah, Washington Oregon, and Montana have low electricity rates (Cents per Kilowatt-hour)\nlike 13.50, 10.55, 10.14, 11.01, and 10.76 cents per kWh respectively as per\nthe EIA electric Power Monthly. These costs vary for the transportation sector\nregion-wise. Further, the home charging prices are usually lower than the\npublic charging stations as the home charging prices do not include\ninstallation, infrastructure development, maintenance, host fees, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the above analysis, it can be\nevaluated that a lower electricity consumption rate of 13.50 cents per kWh and\nthe number of charging ports across the region at regular miles make <strong>Florida\nthe cheapest region for EV charging as of now for the home EV charging</strong>.\nWhile based on the US state electricity rates for the transportation sector and\nthe number of charging stations, Texas’s electricity rate for the\ntransportation sector is 7.27 cents per kWh and 5,372 public charging ports\nwhich is the third-largest number of charging ports available across the US.\nTherefore<strong>, Texas can be considered the cheapest region for EV charging.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/which-region-has-the-cheapest-ev-charging-prices-in-america/\">Which region has the cheapest EV charging prices in America?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/which-region-has-the-cheapest-ev-charging-prices-in-america/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Top benefits of charging a Car at Home over a Commercial EV Charging Station (EVCS)","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-benefits-of-charging-a-car-at-home-over-a-commercial-ev-charging-station-evcs/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-benefits-of-charging-a-car-at-home-over-a-commercial-ev-charging-station-evcs/#respond","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:53:17 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"360Quadrants"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging station"},{"#cdata-section":"Americans Charge EVs"},{"#cdata-section":"Commercial EVCS"},{"#cdata-section":"electric charging systems"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging stations"},{"#cdata-section":"EV Infrastructure"},{"#cdata-section":"free EV charging"},{"#cdata-section":"public charging stations"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2920"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Electric vehicles offer several benefits over conventional ICE-based vehicles.

EVs are cheaper in the long run, easy to\nmaintain, and have a lower carbon footprint. With more users realizing the\nbenefits of the EVs, they are looking for charging options that are convenient,\ntime-saving, and easy to use. It was observed that a huge EV user base\npreferred the home charging points over the commercial charging stations. The\nprobable reasons for the mass shift could be the advantages offered by the home\ncharging systems. The home or the residential chargers do not essentially mean\na private home connection, it may also mean a private workplace, shopping mall,\nor home offering charging service to only a certain number of users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>EVs are usually charged at the <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">public charging stations</a> or with the home charging points. Through the data analysis done by companies, a majority of charging was done using the home charging points during the nighttime whereas the daytime charging was split between public charging stations and private charging stations at the workplaces or malls, etc. Even though the public charging stations offer a rapid charging facility and zero installation costs to the user, it also has some potential drawbacks. The long waiting queues and the time required to charge the vehicle thereafter cause great inconvenience, thereby deviating users towards adopting home charging systems. Another prominent setback of the public charging station is the DC fast charging ports, which when used constantly degrade the car batteries at a faster rate and come with premium pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the home charging points may have some initial deployment costs but offers several benefits over the public charging stations in the long term. The current home chargers are usually Level 1 and Level 2 chargers which provide charging through 120 V and 240 V AC circuits respectively. The Level 3 chargers i.e., the <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">DC fast chargers</a> are compatible only with certain car models and are available at the public charging stations only. The below-listed points further enlighten the three levels of charging and their throughput.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Level I Charger:</strong> Overnight charging using a 120-volt AC outlet</li><li><strong>Level II Charger:</strong> 4-6 hours to charge with 240 volts and 40 amps continuous load</li><li><strong>Level III Charger (DC Fast Charger):</strong> Capable of providing a 100% charging in less than 30 minutes (voltage and current rating vary according to the CPOs)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Top-Benefits-of-Charging-a-car-at-Home.jpg\" alt=\"Types of charging connectors \" class=\"wp-image-2922\"/><figcaption><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Figure</span><em> 1: Types of charging connectors</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With these charging options, most EV users are now able to meet the driving range requirements by easily charging their vehicles overnight through the home charging points. Some of the top benefits of having a <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">home EV charging point</a></strong> can be enlisted as:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charge at ease: </strong>The home charging points eliminate the need to wait in a long queue to charge the vehicle at the charging stations during peak hours. The EV consumers can easily charge their vehicles at their preferred time and convenience without investing a dedicated time at the <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">charging station</a>. Also, since most countries do not have a significant number of charging stations required to address the increasing sales of EVs, installing home chargers will give users a sense of reliability with EV usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Affordable</strong>:\nEV chargers at home only require a dedicated power outlet near the parking\nlocation home and no other additional installation costs are required, unless\nLevel 2 chargers are installed which have minimal installation costs. The household\nelectricity rates per kWh are low as compared to the public charging station electricity\nrates, therefore the users need to pay the high charging rates set by the\nthird-party energy companies like BP and Shell. Such eliminated overhead\ncharges at the public charging stations make the home charging system more\naffordable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was observed that the users who used solar\npanels for electricity saved more with the home charging solutions. These home\nchargers also provide real-time time data using which the EV consumers can also\nclaim tax benefits in some countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Battery Health Optimization: </strong>Any battery degrades over a certain period of time, however even if the\npublic charging station offers great charging at a faster speed, it may cause\npotential damage to the car battery health due to its high-power charging\nports. The home charging points on the contrary charge the vehicle with minimal\nvoltage levels, leading to delayed battery degradation and optimized usage</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Most EV home chargers are compatible with a wide array of electric\nvehicles. Such additional benefits add in terms of future EV purchases by the\nuser from a different manufacturer. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Faster and Safer Charging: </strong>Using a home charging point can be faster than the public charging\nstation unless the user is using the fast-charging port which has very high\nprices. The home charge</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major benefit of using the home\ncharging points is safety and security. At the public stations, leaving the car\nfor a longer duration may expose it to several risks of theft and vandalism,\ntherefore using home charging points assures the users with safe charging of\nthe vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Americans Charge EVs &#8211; At home or at Commercial EVCS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the Alternative Fuel Data Center of\nthe US Department of Energy, the present American EVCS network consists of a\ntotal of 48,298 public charging stations out of which only 6,265 are the DC\nfast chargers and the rest mostly are equipped with the Level 2 chargers. About\n80% of these charging points comprise Level 2 chargers. These Level 2 chargers\ncharge the vehicles ~6.8 times faster than the Level 1 chargers and come with\nan optimized pricing structure as compared to the DC fast chargers, therefore\nare the most widely preferred chargers across America. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As electric vehicles are getting ubiquitous in the US, the need for fast and accessible charging systems has also increased. Automakers like Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen through its subsidiary Electrify America are investing in expanding the <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charging stations</a></strong> across America. However, the problem of accessible charging points will persist unless the deployments of these planned charging infrastructures are completed. To address this problem the state governments and the local authorities are figuring out ways to make the <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">electric charging systems</a> available to maximum EV users. For instance, to reach the target of net-zero emission by 2028, Los Angeles has started providing a rebate to developers and managers who are offering charging stations in the parking lots for buildings with multiple families. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a densely populated area like New York\nCity, where owning a private space for parking is a luxury, maximum residents\ncannot use private home charging systems. To ease such a problem, the local\ngovernment of the city launched a curbside charging network called PlugNYC,\nthrough a partnership with Con Edison and Canadian charging station company FLO.\nThe PlugNYC has an initial installation of 34 stations with 100 plugs and\nadditional 4 stations with 20 plugs for the city’s fleet vehicles. It further plans\nto install 40,000 public Level 2 chargers and 6,000 DC fast chargers by 2030. NYC\nis focused on creating one of the largest municipal electric vehicle charging\nnetworks to support the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the rural American areas, the US Department of Transportation has introduced the Rural <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV Infrastructure</a> Toolkit under the ROUTES Initiative to help rural entities plan the infrastructure and fund EV chargers. While in West Virginia, State Parks has installed electric charging stations where EV drivers get the complimentary service of free EV charging, while they rent the lodge or spend money in the shop. The Colorado Energy Office and Regional Air Quality Council have supported the installation of the first Level 2 charging station in the parking spaces. The Carbondale has expanded to 16 charging stations, of which 15 are free Level 2 charging stations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such initiatives, it is evident\nthat the US government is working in its direction to achieve the target set by\nthe federal government of net-zero emissions. However, shifting the usage from\nICE-based vehicles to electric or hybrid electric vehicles will be a critical\nfactor in deciding the EV charging infrastructure of the US in near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Growth Strategy Ahead &#8211; American Commercial EVCS Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the period 2011 to 2013, the US\nDepartment of Energy along with ChargePoint installed 17,000 AC Level 2\ncharging and over 100 fast charging ports in 22 regions of the country for\nresidential and commercial usage. Through this project, it was noticed that\ndespite the installation of several public charging stations, the major\npopulation of EV consumers utilized the home or work charging stations.\nHowever, now with the higher installations of public and home charging stations,\na survey conducted on the consumer behavior, reflected that around 57% of the\nEV user population is willing to invest in the home charging Level 2 chargers,\nwhile the rest of the EV drivers are tending towards paying a premium for DC\nfast charging points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2021, the US government\nannounced the Electric Vehicle Charging Action Plan which is aimed at building\na national network of 500,000 EV charging stations. The plan includes a total\ninvestment of USD 7.5 billion, where USD 2.5 billion will be utilized in rural\ncharging, improving local air quality, and increasing EV charging access in\ndisadvantaged communities and corridors. The government has also planned on\nincreasing the domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components. Such\ninitiatives by the US government in the EV charging systems are transformative\nwith an aim to touch down the net-zero emissions by the year 2050. Additionally,\ncompanies like Electrify America are also extending their support in achieving\nthe net-zero emission target. The company is planning to invest USD 2 billion\nin Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) infrastructure across the US, thereby supporting\nincreased adoption of ZEV technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The home charging points tend to offer\nnumerous benefits over the public charging stations. By charging the vehicles\novernight at home, the EV drivers can save their time and are able to drive conveniently.\nIt is not far that the advancements in the home charging solutions will reduce\nthis charging time and further accelerate EV adoption. However, it is to take\nnote that the users will still need to top up the charging while on the long-run\nroutes. A co-existing public and private charging infrastructure will foster\nthe growth of EV charging networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the US has been an early adopter of electric vehicle charging technology, nearly half of the users still step back from buying an EV due to the limited network of <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">Level 2 charging stations</a></strong> and the premium price of the fast-charging systems. To increase the adoption rate of EV technology, more installation of home chargers will be critical as the EV drivers tend to charge their vehicles with convenience in line with the optimized pricing. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-benefits-of-charging-a-car-at-home-over-a-commercial-ev-charging-station-evcs/\">Top benefits of charging a Car at Home over a Commercial EV Charging Station (EVCS)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/top-benefits-of-charging-a-car-at-home-over-a-commercial-ev-charging-station-evcs/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"How Commercial Vehicles can get optimum Cybersecurity?","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-commercial-vehicles-can-get-optimum-cybersecurity/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-commercial-vehicles-can-get-optimum-cybersecurity/#respond","pubDate":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 06:54:03 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity Software"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging station"},{"#cdata-section":"Commercial Vehicle Telematics"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity companies"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity software"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity vendors"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging companies"},{"#cdata-section":"ev charging station business"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2911"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Automotive Cyber security &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Hackers can target up to fifty different automotive IoT devices (computers) in modern vehicles.

As you\nmight expect, this makes vehicle cyber security a top priority for customers,\nautomakers, and OEMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle cybersecurity entails\nputting in place proven defences to: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>• prevent data theft (such as GPS\nlocation information or data from your smartphone connected to the Bluetooth\nspeaker), </p>\n\n\n\n<p>• prevent hackers from\ncontrolling or manipulating your vehicle (for example, by disabling the burglar\nalarm or fooling the collision avoidance system), and </p>\n\n\n\n<p>• ensure that no one can damage\nyour vehicle (for example, by resetting your oil change counter so you do not\nget your oil changed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software\"><strong>Automotive cybersecurity</strong></a> is a relatively new sector that is rapidly evolving to keep up with the industry&#8217;s fast-paced technological improvements and the growing number of cyber events. Traditional car safety laws and security standards, unfortunately, do not adequately encompass the cyber dangers posed by today&#8217;s connected vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automotive Cyber security\nmarket&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As connectivity advancements\nalter the automobile industry, the global market for connected cars is expected\nto rise dramatically over the next several years. Consumers benefit from a\nvariety of features, including high-definition streaming video, Wi-Fi access,\nbetter entertainment systems, and the ability to manage components of the\nvehicle remotely using mobile phone applications, such as the locking/unlocking\nand ignition mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, much like any other gadget that connects to the internet, cyber thieves can pose a threat to car security. Leaked personal data, risks to a vehicle&#8217;s vital security and safety procedures, and, in extreme situations, full remote control of the vehicle can all come from security breaches. Because of the increased reliance on applications, connectivity, and more complex and integrated electronic components as the industry goes toward more autonomous vehicles, these dangers are only going to get worse. Consumer confidence, privacy, and brand reputation might all suffer if these issues are not addressed. Worse, client safety is jeopardised.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/automotive-cyber-security.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2913\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The market for automotive cyber security is presently valued at $1.75 billion. By 2026, the worldwide <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software\">automotive cybersecurity industry</a> is expected to rise from $2.0 billion to $5.3 billion. By 2028, the market for automotive cyber security is estimated to reach $7.89 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the daily increase in the number of vehicles on the road and the rapid advancement of the technology involved, it is critical to establish a strong <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/software/cybersecurity-software\"><strong>cybersecurity system</strong></a>. If this is not paid attention to, one can hack into the system and start a slew of fraudulent operations. By recognising the risk, correcting it, and protecting the computer&#8217;s security system from future threats, an automotive cybersecurity system is an efficient and effective approach for dealing with cyber threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The increased demand for an\neffective and efficient security system is due to the growing acceptance of\ninnovative technologies in the automotive industry. Rising cyber dangers in the\ntransportation and automobile industries will boost demand even more. The\nvehicle cyber security market will continue to grow and expand as intercity\ntransportation and logistics services improve. In addition, rising demand for\ncommercial and passenger automobiles equipped with innovative technologies, as\nwell as rising personal income, will expand market potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle connectivity is rapidly\nexpanding, resulting in a plethora of new capabilities and appealing business\nmodels. Simultaneously, the threat of cyber-attacks on vehicle networks is\nincreasing. Such attacks endanger the vehicle&#8217;s functioning safety and may\nresult in monetary loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to long-established\ntechnologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and big data and analytics,\nnewer technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and blockchain have\nseveral uses in the automotive industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Cyber\nsecurity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because technology is rapidly\nadvancing, there is an increasing need to concentrate on the cyber security of\nelectric vehicles. Owners and the EV industry should boost up their efforts to\nprotect vehicles and charging infrastructure from cyber-attacks, given the rush\nto migrate to electric cars and trucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spread of potentially vulnerable <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\"><strong><em>EV charging stations</em></strong></a> around the world offers a significant cyber threat as electric vehicles become a larger part of the market. If cybersecurity is not prioritised, these stations might become a hacker superhighway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few key cybersecurity\nbest practises that serve as the first line of defence against hackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• It is critical to evaluate\nfirewall and router setups on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Make a list of all the\ncomponents in EVCS and look for vulnerabilities on a granular level in each of\nthem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Public-facing web instances\npose a substantial threat to important sectors, yet security teams routinely\nignore them. As a result, the entire environment is more vulnerable to\ncyberattacks. It is critical to keep track of your assets&#8217; exposure, especially\nin certain industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Have a robust password policy\nin place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Limit access to assets based on\nthe employee&#8217;s clearance level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Employees and those working in\nvital industries must receive cybersecurity awareness training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, electric vehicle\ncharging infrastructure is a device (or set of devices) that waits for another\ndevice to connect and begin communicating without the use of a third-party\nfirewall or other cybersecurity devices &#8211; all these technologies must be built\ninto the charging station itself. EV charging stations/technologies are\nparticularly vulnerable to attacks due to their complexity and quick\nproliferation, as some security precautions may be disregarded. Hackers appear\nto have a lot of access to electric vehicle charging facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global effort to extend the\nuse of electric vehicles is picking up speed, and 2021 saw a boom in EV sales.\nElectric vehicle sales are at an all-time high as purchasers rush to switch\nfrom gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs due to rising fuel costs, which are\nexacerbated by global geopolitical tensions. With the growing demand for electric\nvehicles (EVs) around the world, malicious attackers will target the EV\nindustry to cause disorder among the citizens of a country and disrupt\nday-to-day operations of a metropolis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charging infrastructure</a>, like any other connected device, is subject to cyber-attacks. Nonetheless, the complexity and rapid evolution of technology and connected gadgets endangers this technology. Whether on the device itself or through a third-party app, they will require the same level of monitoring and protection to ensure that they do not open doors for hackers to pass through. As the number of electric vehicles on the road increases and more EV charging stations are built around the world, it is vital that we focus on sophisticated cybersecurity measures to keep drivers safe and safeguard the critical data in our vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping a continual eye on both\nknown and unknown threats is the best method for cybersecurity professionals to\nprotect charging stations from intrusions. Utilities, for example, rely on\nIPKeys Cyber Partners&#8217; developing VSOC (Vehicle Security Operations Centre)\nplatform. This programme provides for cybersecurity during the post-production\nphase. Protecting connected vehicles and the smart mobility ecosystem is\ncritical, as it allows companies to monitor their whole infrastructure and\nvehicles in real time, as well as detect cyber threats using\nautomotive-specific analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cybersecurity approaches and\nsolutions for commercial Vehicles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the commercial vehicle\ndomain, there are a range of cybersecurity techniques and solutions. Most\nsolutions appear to come from other disciplines, particularly the automobile\ndomain. However, due to the characteristics of the commercial vehicle area,\nsome adaptations will be required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Legacy Vehicles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving the cybersecurity\ncharacteristics of commercial cars that are already on the road is difficult,\nif not impossible. To prevent the most likely attack scenario, either use a\nfleet management solution to connect vehicles with known vulnerabilities to the\nInternet and turn off all wireless interfaces or use a filter between all\nexternal communication interfaces and the vehicle&#8217;s electronics network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Separation and Network\nArchitectures</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern network topologies use\ngateways to divide networks and use firewalls and filters to separate network\nsegments. No network with external interfaces links directly to a\nsafety-critical network, such as the powertrain network, and all traffic is\nrouted through a gateway with a firewall first. There may be dedicated networks\nconnecting only two nodes, such as an ADAS controller and a camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The car industry is already\nmoving toward the next domain controller architecture, in which only a few\nsophisticated domain controllers, often connected by Ethernet, connect to basic\nelectronics components. The domain controller design follows the same network\nisolation paradigm for security reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On-Board Communication\nSecurity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important\nsecurity goals is to secure on-board communication. Authentication is usually\nalways the essential security purpose; however, encryption is also interesting\nin a few circumstances. An adversary&#8217;s ability to develop further is highly\nhampered by such authenticated on-board communication. For example, if an\nadversary successfully compromises a telematics unit or an OBD dongle, the\nattacker is only able to authenticate messages sent to components on a\npre-defined list but not to messages sent to any safety-critical component\nprovided the system is properly constructed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Platform for Secure Computing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicle electronics necessitate a\nsafe computer platform. Secure boot protects integrity during start up,\nhypervisors or software containers with secure inter-process communication\nseparate software components, and a hardened kernel as well as memory\nprotection (e.g., address randomization) safeguard the kernel. There are also\nmechanisms for monitoring the computing platform&#8217;s integrity, such as employing\na whitelist of binary files that are allowed to be executed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anomaly Tracking</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting a vehicle against\ncyber-attacks and data extraction is a top priority. A second objective is the\ncapacity to monitor the vehicle&#8217;s network and computing platforms to identify\npotential breaches and improve cybersecurity over time. The output of on-board\nnetwork anomaly detection systems and ECU platform integrity monitors can be\nmerged, used for local anomaly detection (which may result in a basic local\nreaction), and then sent via telematics to a Security Operations Centre (SOC),\nwhich then runs analytics over all data to find anomaly patterns in the big\npicture. This information is then given to automobile manufacturers and\nsuppliers, who examine it and begin the incident response process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Centre for Security Operations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network anomaly detection\nsystems and ECU platform integrity monitors of vehicles send reports to the\nsecurity operations centre (SOC). The SOC then takes these reports, analyses\nthem, and looks for connections between the occurrences that have been\nrecorded. Human analysts investigate facts to determine whether filtered\noccurrences are related to cybersecurity incidents, other abnormalities, or\nfalse alarms, using automated algorithms. The fundamental system can be\nrectified, and software can be updated via firmware over-the-air procedure\nafter a genuine cybersecurity event is proven and the mechanisms are\nunderstood. Naturally, the more reports from various vehicles that a SOC\nreceives, the more successful it becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over-the-Air Firmware Security</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>FOTA (firmware over-the-air) is a\nmethod of updating functionality and fixing faults, some of which may be\nsecurity-related. The use of FOTA has the potential to reduce recalls. However,\nthere are countless cases of FOTA systems being hacked in the PC network\nenvironment. Flame malware, for example, exploited several cryptographic flaws\nbefore hijacking the Windows update mechanism and distributing malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software updates are usually\nprotected by digitally certifying the revised firmware, so that an ECU will\nonly update with it if the verification is successful. The OEM and/or supplier\nsign the code, ideally on a secure computer that is offline and not easily\naccessible. A secure communication connection between the cloud and the car,\nsuch as the widely used transport layer security (TLS), can further improve\nsecurity. The Uptane framework for safe FOTA strengthens security and divides\nduties of the relevant entities, allowing the complete system to recover even\nif a single server is compromised.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-commercial-vehicles-can-get-optimum-cybersecurity/\">How Commercial Vehicles can get optimum Cybersecurity?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-commercial-vehicles-can-get-optimum-cybersecurity/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Electric Vehicle Charging Station","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/electric-vehicle-charging-station/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/electric-vehicle-charging-station/#respond","pubDate":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 21:15:09 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"EV charging station"},{"#cdata-section":"EV"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging companies"},{"#cdata-section":"ev charging station business"},{"#cdata-section":"Top EV charging companies"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2916"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>USE Cases Use Case #1: Charging at home Even though the public charging stations offer the benefits of no installment cost, they come with some potential drawbacks such as long wait times, inconvenience caused to locate charging stations in the vicinity, and battery damage due to level 3 high charging output power.

These chargers are an economically viable option as they consume electricity from the residential energy power grid or through solar energy modules at home. Several <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charger manufacturers</a> have made compatible chargers such that they can easily charge other EV models and help through intelligent software and mobile applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Case #2:</strong>\n<strong>Wireless Charging</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with ongoing electric vehicle growth, there are several drawbacks to the traditional <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">wired charging stations</a>. For instance, connectors and charging cables can wear down over a period of time, reducing the charging efficiency. Next, the need for a unified charging cable has been constantly pointed out by EV users. Such features limit the overall charging capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">Wireless charging</a></strong> offers enormous benefits over traditional wired charging stations. There are different types of wireless charging technologies available which include, inductive wireless charging, resonant inductive coupling, capacitive wireless charging, microwaves, etc. By using these technologies, a <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">wireless charging system</a></strong> is installed where vehicles remain stationary such as in parking lots. In the near future, this wireless charging system can be embedded into the roads as well, such that it will become a commercially viable option and vehicles will be charged continuously without downtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Case #3:</strong>\n<strong>Public Charging Stations</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric vehicles using public charging stations only bear the usage costs and are saved from paying the huge installment costs. The public charging stations usually use the level 2 chargers such that they are compatible with all types of vehicles. Such <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">charging stations</a> are maintained by the manufacturers and are managed by management software. These systems are easy to use for the consumer with their simple plug-and-play interface. With public charging available at more locations, the USAge of electric vehicles is set to become mainstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Use Case #4: DC</strong> <strong>Fast Charging</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of electric vehicles is growing\nsubstantially. However, downtime for charging is the major pullback for the\nwider adoption of the technology. Several automakers offer the swappable\nbattery option to consumers, but this option is not suitable for long-term\nusage, and other levels 1 and level 2 charging options are time-consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DC fast charging technology offers higher charging rates which chargers the <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV battery</a> much faster than the conventional charging options available. These offer a much faster charging experience within a shorter time period and the output power ranges usually from 50- 350kW. The major benefit of using a DC fast charging charger is that once it charges the vehicle’s battery up to 80% it automatically slows down the charging rate, thereby reducing the overcharging of the battery and thus maintaining the life of the EV battery. There are currently rising thermal issues over DC fast charging to which several measures to handle the battery life are underway.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/electric-vehicle-charging-station/\">Electric Vehicle Charging Station</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/electric-vehicle-charging-station/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"How fast are some of the best EV charging stations","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-fast-are-some-of-the-best-ev-charging-stations/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-fast-are-some-of-the-best-ev-charging-stations/#respond","pubDate":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:40:47 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"360Quadrants"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging station"},{"#cdata-section":"charging infrastructure"},{"#cdata-section":"charging station business"},{"#cdata-section":"electric charging cost"},{"#cdata-section":"EV charging companies"},{"#cdata-section":"ev charging station business"},{"#cdata-section":"wireless electric vehicle charger"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2906"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining huge momentum in the ongoing scenario of rising CO2 emissions and scarce fossil fuel resources.

It is due to the ongoing research and development of fast charging solutions; users find electric vehicles as the most viable option. The electric vehicle (EV) charging systems are categorized as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 based on the output power delivered. Level 3 chargers are the real game-changer of electromobility. These level 3 chargers are designed to offer power ranging from 150 kW to 400 kW and more and are operated by private networks which directly connect the charging station to the electricity grid. Some of the prominent players active in the electric vehicle charging station include ABB, Electrify America, Voltempo, EVgo, ChargePoint, and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the global pandemic, the year 2020\nwitnessed a major boom in the adoption of electric vehicles. Cars such as Tesla\nModel 3, ID.3 Volkswagen, Kia EV6, Porsche Taycan, Hyundai Ioniq 5etc. were\nseen to drive the fast-charging market. These cars are based on the concept of DC\nfast charging and the batteries installed in these cars are capable of charging\nfrom 10 percent to 80 percent in less than 30 minutes when connected to a 350-kW\ncharging line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, automakers are collaborating with other giant groups in order to expand ultra-rapid <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">charging infrastructure</a> across geographies. Hyundai for instance has collaborated with huge South Korean giant Lotte Group and KB Asset Management. Together the companies have targeted to add 5,000 ultra-fast chargers (UFC) by the year 2025. This involves leasing high-power charging stations to private operators. Another company Porsche has deployed 35 ultra-fast charging stations in partnership with Iberdrola in Southern Europe. The charging station has a capacity of up to 400 kW, capable of recharging car batteries in less than five minutes. Such initiatives by automakers will boost the electric vehicle mobility market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of EV charging at stations in North America </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The North American market is witnessing an\noverwhelming surge in electric mobility due to Level 2 and fast charging\nsolutions, which allow EV users to charge vehicles with ease in their homes.\nWhile the Level 1 chargers constitute about 2% of the total EV charger across\nthe US, Level 2 chargers comprise a majority of 80% of charging systems, mainly\ndue to the higher power rating as compared to the Level 1. It was observed that\nby 2021, 15% of the public EVSE port in the US were DC fast chargers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canadian market specifically is also pursuing the EVCS market potentially well. It has a huge deployment of the Level 2, and an increasing growth was observed in the adoption of DC fast chargers. Tesla is one of the most prominent EVCS vendors in Canada. Other prominent companies include ChargePoint, FLO, EcoCharge, Electrify Canada, Petro-Canada, Greenlots, and SWTCH Energy among others. These companies are expanding their infrastructure and have made several advancements in the roaming network agreements and application interfacing, therefore attracting a huge customer base.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/North-America-EV-Charging-Station.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2907\"/><figcaption> <em>Figure1: Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (Level 2 and DC Fast Charging) Across North America</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: Alternative Fuels Data Center (<a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC\">https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC</a>\n)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more and more DC fast charging\nsolutions are being deployed across North America, the major contributor being\nthe US. It is anticipated that DC fast chargers will further accelerate EV\nadoption across the US and Canada. Companies like Electrify America,\nChargePoint, Blink, Tesla, Volta, and EVgo are some of the prominent vendors of\nultra-fast charging systems in the North American market. These companies have\ndeployed numerous fast-charging stations across America thereby easing\ninterstate transportation through highways. Automakers like General Motors and\nPorsche are partnering with several vendors to expand the production of their\nlatest EV models which are compatible and give high performance to the user\nwhen the electric vehicle is charged using fast charging systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABB another prominent <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">electric vehicle charging station</a></strong> manufacturer is seen to be expanding its footprint in the North American market by deploying ABB’s Terra 53 DC charging stations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>EV Charging Station Business Opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">electric vehicle charging business</a> heavily relies on uniformity across the EV charging station standards and equipment. EVCS ecosystem consists of participants such as Charge Point Operators, Energy companies, and Automotive OEMs. In order to increase the adoption of EV technology, CPOs are focusing on offering DC fast charging systems that could rapidly charge the EV batteries within minutes. The Energy companies on the other hand are offering EV fast charging at their existing gas stations by adding the appropriate infrastructure. Further, the Automakers are also considering the EVCS business as a standalone opportunity to expand their business by both entering the new market and expanding their existing EV sales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charging stations</a> come with an end-to-end customized solution offering. The additional support of backend power infrastructure, compatibility for different EV charging standards, and various software are now easing the usage of electric charging systems. Several places such as public malls, restaurants, workplaces, and housing societies are now having charging stations thereby providing more convenient options to charge their vehicle on the go. China, the US, and Germany are investing heavily in the research and development of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station\">EV charging infrastructure</a></strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is expected that the electric vehicle\nwill constitute about 30% of the total vehicles by 2025, and this trend will\nkeep on increasing majorly because of the efforts taken by both automakers and\nusers to reduce the CO2 emissions. This ultimately creates the need for\nhigh-power and reliable charging stations for a mass number of users. EV users\nare now leveraging the intelligent options used by the CPOs. These intelligent\nfeatures include dynamic power allocation, highway transit charging, locating\nthe charging stations, battery conditions, etc., further accelerating the EVCS\nmarket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be expected that with several options of AC and DC chargers for home and public charging stations and a wide geographic footprint, companies such as ABB, Tesla, <a href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/automotive/electric-vehicle-charging-station/chargepoint-inc\">ChargePoint</a> will dominate the electric vehicle charging station market. Even though the ultra-fast charging system looks attractive for the electric vehicle market, it might not find major user adoption due to its high premium prices, thereby limiting the wider adoption of the technology. With more moderately priced charging systems, the CPOs can expect a major turn-on in the establishment of the fast-charging technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The ultra-fast charging scenario</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ABB has been dominating the electric\nvehicle charging station market with its Terra HP Generation III. Other\ncomparable systems such as Siemens’ SICHARGE D and Pantograph (for buses and\ntrucks), EV Box’s Utraoniq, Hypernova from WallBox, Electrify America’s DC Fast\nChargers and others have proven to be equally good when it comes to offering a\nfast-charging system ranging from 300 kW to 350 kW in 15 minutes. However, what\nsets apart the ABB is the wide range of charging and electrification solutions\nfor electric cars, hybrid buses, trucks, vans, ships, and railways and the\noutput power of 360 kW. ABB’s 3rd generation charger has a wide range of output\nvoltage ranging from 150 to 920 VDC and charges one EV at 350 kW or two\nelectric vehicles simultaneously at 175 kW. However, the only setback is the 350\nkW or 175 kW (for two EVs) charging line is applicable only to the version with\ntwo CCS connections.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, <strong>Voltempo</strong> a leading technology developer of electric automakers launched its <strong>HyperCharging</strong>. As per the company, the HyperCharging system can deliver 1,000kW of power which is around 2.8 times more than the power delivered by the other comparable charging stations. This solution is able to charge the compatible electric vehicle within 6 minutes and has a unique capability of charging 24 vehicles simultaneously. Through its demonstration, the charging system looks promising for now and Voltempo has further stated that it will be able to build a charging system with the efficiency that could match a similar time that it takes to refuel a conventional, petrol-driven vehicle. Another prominent company, <strong>Iberdrola</strong> has launched an ultra-fast charging hub for electric vehicles having a capacity of up to 400 kW and is capable of recharging car batteries in less than five minutes and can charge up to 16 vehicles simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Analysis-of-the-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-System.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2908\"/><figcaption><em>Figure 2: Analysis of the Electric Vehicle Charging System based on power and charging time taken</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though, with such high-power charging\ntechnologies in place, how much the EV users will be able to leverage the\nfast-charging technology will entirely depend on the vehicle since not all\ntypes of EV batteries are designed to handle such high-power ratings. However,\nit can be predicted that once the automakers develop the compatible EV\nbatteries and Voltempo expands its geographic presence with the 1000 kW power\ntechnology, a major transformation across the electric mobility market is bound\nto take place.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-fast-are-some-of-the-best-ev-charging-stations/\">How fast are some of the best EV charging stations</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog\">360Quadrants</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/how-fast-are-some-of-the-best-ev-charging-stations/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"Cybersecurity Software","link":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/cybersecurity-software/","comments":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/2022/cybersecurity-software/#respond","pubDate":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 12:24:28 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"user"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity Software"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity"},{"#cdata-section":"Cybersecurity software"},{"#cdata-section":"Network security"},{"#cdata-section":"Network security software"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.360quadrants.com/blog/?p=2904"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>USE Cases Use Case #1: Network Security The underlying network architecture of an organization consists of hardware and software systems that are highly susceptible to data breaches, intrusions, and other cyber-attacks.
