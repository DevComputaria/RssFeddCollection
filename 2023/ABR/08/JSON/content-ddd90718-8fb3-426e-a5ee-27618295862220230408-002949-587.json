One such plugin widely used by over 60,000 websites is the &#8220;WordPress Online Booking and Scheduling Plugin &#8211; Bookly.&#8221; Bookly streamlines online bookings and automates the reservation process. However, like many other WordPress plugins, it, too, can be vulnerable to exploitation by attackers.</p>\n<p>In March 2023, Quick Heal Security Labs identified a vulnerability in the Bookly plugin. As soon as we discovered the flaw, we initiated responsible disclosure procedures to ensure that the vulnerability would be addressed promptly. On March 3, 2023, we contacted the Bookly plugin support team after discovering the vulnerability earlier that day and provided them with the full technical details. We also notified plugins@wordpress.org and Wordfence (CNA) of the vulnerability. The vulnerability was quickly acknowledged and assigned the CVE-2023-1172 identifier. The Bookly team worked on developing a patch and released it on March 9, 2023, in version 21.5.1.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the root cause of the vulnerability found in the Bookly plugin, as well as an examination of the patch that was released to address the issue.<strong>Â </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Analysing CVE</strong><strong>&#8211;</strong><strong>2023-1172 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Name:</strong></p>\n<p>Our research revealed that the Bookly plugin&#8217;s &#8220;Full name&#8221; field was vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate input sanitization and output escaping. We further investigated and found that the plugin reuses the user&#8217;s &#8220;Full name&#8221; input in multiple files, significantly increasing the risk of security breaches if the input is not properly sanitized and escaped to prevent malicious code injection. The below code snippet demonstrates how the value of the &#8220;Full name&#8221; field is utilized:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5585\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"71\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1.jpg 610w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code1-300x35.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></p>\n<p>As shown below, the &#8220;Full name&#8221; field value is stored in the variable $codes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5586\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2.jpg 604w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code2-300x155.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /></p>\n<p>Subsequently, the variable $codes is utilized in the calendar&#8217;s tooltip.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5587\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3.jpg 599w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code3-300x164.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></p>\n<p>However, there appears to be a lack of proper sanitization measures when utilizing the $codes variable later in the program.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5588\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"603\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4.jpg 603w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code4-300x155.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Resolving the Issue: A Look at the Patch</strong></p>\n<p>After examining the patch that resolves the vulnerability, we discovered that the $codes variable is now adequately sanitized to prevent any potential security breaches in the program. Notably, the patch employs PHP&#8217;s &#8220;strip_tags&#8221; function to sanitize the $codes variable and mitigate the attack before it can be used elsewhere in the code.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5589\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1798\" height=\"809\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5.jpg 1798w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-768x346.jpg 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/code_diff_snap5-1024x461.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1798px) 100vw, 1798px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>This post highlighted a vulnerability in the Bookly plugin that could allow unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially compromising a site owner&#8217;s entire site when they accessed the calendar tooltip from the plugin. Thankfully, the vulnerability has been fully resolved in version 21.5.1. We strongly recommend that WordPress site owners update their site to the latest patched version of the plugin (currently version 21.6 at the time of writing) to prevent potential attacks.</p>\n<p>All SEQRITE and Quick Heal customers are protected against any exploits targeting this vulnerability through the following signatures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP/CVE-2023-1172!VK.46842</li>\n<li>HTTP/CVE-2023-1172!VK.47543</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wordpress-site-security-alert-bookly-plugin-vulnerability-discovered-and-patched/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">WordPress Site Security Alert: Bookly Plugin Vulnerability Discovered and Patched</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">Blogs on Information Technology, Network &amp; Cybersecurity | Seqrite</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wordpress-site-security-alert-bookly-plugin-vulnerability-discovered-and-patched/feed/","slash:comments":"0","commentcount":"0"},{"title":"Expiro: Old Virus Resurfaces to Cast New Challenge","link":"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/expiro-old-virus-resurfaces-to-cast-new-challenge/","comments":"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/expiro-old-virus-resurfaces-to-cast-new-challenge/#respond","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 06:04:47 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Seqrite"},"author":"Seqrite","category":{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/?p=5556"},"img":"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MicrosoftTeams-image-5-230x168.png","description":{"#cdata-section":"<p>A recent virus infection faced by some users was swiftly detected as being caused by Expiro.

After successful decompression and decryption, the infected application is launched, infecting other executables in the system. The infection process is implemented in such a manner that the infected application works just as a normal one would, without the user&#8217;s knowledge of the application being infected.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What makes the restoration of files infected by Expiro challenging?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the use of obfuscated call patching routine and encrypted virus code data, cleaning infected code with complete accuracy is challenging, leaving the executables at a high risk of instability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the call is patched, original addresses are encrypted with multiple layers, followed by compression. Decompression and decryption of these addresses happen during runtime in memory. Calculating and restoring these clean addresses is tricky and may result in the corruption of the original file.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How Expiro operates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the system is infected with Expiro, it possesses worm-like capabilities, where it checks for network-mapped drives and infects executable files in mapped network drives. This results in spreading the infection across the network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expiro connects to remote malicious CNC servers and acts as a backdoor by sending system information and receiving commands from remote servers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some attackers consciously keep their CnC servers unavailable at most times and bring them up only periodically.</span></p>\n<p><b>Risks posed by ExpiroÂ </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the ability to communicate with a remote CnC server, Expiro possesses capabilities to accept commands from its controller and execute them on the infected systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With successful commands delivered to victims, Expiro can:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Install other malware (like keyloggers, spywares, ransomware etc.)Â </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Steal and upload sensitive information</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Disable security software from the systems</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Hijack servers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Establish itself to act at a later point in time</span></p>\n<p><b>How to identify if the system or network is infected with Expiro</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Expiro Malware family is an &#8220;appender.&#8221; Hence the residual symptoms of Expiro Malware are not unique.

It obtains initial access to the victim&#8217;s network via SMB brute forcing from various IPs.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5549 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1-300x84.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"116\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1-300x84.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lockbit3.drawio-1.png 754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><strong>Fig. 1 â Attack Chain</strong></em></p>\n<p>The sys-internal tool PSEXEC is used to execute malicious BAT files on a single system which were later cleaned off. These files indicate activity related to modifying RDP &amp; authentication settings while disabling antivirus at the same time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;openrdp.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>\n<li>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;mimon.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>\n<li>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;auth.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>\n<li>C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c &#8220;&#8221;turnoff.bat&#8221; &#8220;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PSEXEC is also used to spread laterally across the victim&#8217;s network to execute the ransomware payload. The encryption is done using a multi-threaded approach where only shared drives got encrypted. The executed payload must have a valid key passed along with the command-line option &#8216;-pass.&#8217; The encrypted files are appended with the <em>.zbzdbs59d</em> extension, which suggests that the builder generates each payload with a random static string.</p>\n<h2>Payload Analysis</h2>\n<p>The ransomware payload is dropped inside the <em>Windows</em> directory, where every variant requires a unique key to be passed as an argument. This feature was previously known to be used by other ransomware groups like <em>BlackCat</em> and <em>Egregor</em>. Even if the name of the payload is changed from &#8216;Lock.exe&#8217; to anything else or put in any other directory, it does not run. The pass key used in this case is <strong>60c14e91dc3375e4523be5067ed3b111</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let us look at a few stages of the payload below:</p>\n<h3>Decrypting Sections</h3>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5547 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-300x220.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-300x220.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-230x168.png 230w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-768x564.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2-150x110.png 150w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/decrypt_func_2.png 809w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Fig. 2 â Pseudo code for decrypting PE Sections</em></strong></p>\n<p>The key passed in the argument is taken from the command line and verified. If it passes verification, this key is further processed to obtain a 1-byte key to decrypt specific sections obtained by traversing the PEB structure. The three sections decrypted in memory are â TEXT, DATA, and PDATA.</p>\n<h3>Resolving Obfuscated APIs</h3>\n<p>Being packed and having only a few imports, Win32 APIs are resolved by decrypting the obfuscated string with XOR using the key <strong>0x3A013FD5</strong>, which is again unique to each payload.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5546 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api-300x41.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"366\" height=\"50\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api-300x41.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/win32api.png 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Fig. 3 â Resolving APIs</em></strong></p>\n<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>\n<p>When Admin privileges are not present during execution, it uses <strong>CMSTPLUA COM</strong> to bypass the UAC prompt, a legitimate Windows Connection Manager Service. This elevates the rights from the user to the administrator level with another instance of the ransomware payload, terminating the current process.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5545 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-300x92.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"213\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-300x92.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-768x236.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1-1024x315.png 1024w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cmlua_1.png 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Fig. 4 â UAC Bypass using CMSTPLUA</em></strong></p>\n<h3>Anti-Debugging Technique</h3>\n<p>Threads used for file encryption are hidden from the debugger by calling <strong>NtSetInformationThread</strong> Win32 API via <strong>ThreadInformationClass</strong> with an undocumented value <strong>0x11</strong> that denotes <strong>ThreadHideFromDebugger</strong>.

It also includes the threat message to leak the stolen data if the ransom amount is not paid and ends with the warnings as usual. Multiple TOR mirrors for their leak site can be seen in the ransom note, which is used to reduce redundancy.</p>\n<h3>File Encryption</h3>\n<p>Before starting file encryption, a registry key for <em>DefaultIcon</em> is created to associate an icon to all the encrypted files. Along with this ICO file (zbzdbs59d.ico), a BMP file is also dropped in the <strong>C:\\ProgramData</strong> directory. Files are encrypted by creating multiple threads where each filename is replaced with a random string generated and appending the extension to them. With full encryption completed under 2 minutes it still has the fastest encryption process since LockBit 2.0.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5542 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr-297x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr-297x300.png 297w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr-150x150.png 150w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr-55x55.png 55w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr-45x45.png 45w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/encr.png 498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Fig. 7 â Encrypted Filenames</em></strong></p>\n<h3>Changing Wallpaper</h3>\n<p>Finally, the desktop background (different from 2.0 variant) of the victim machine is changed with the <em>systemparametersinfoW</em> win32 API, and displays LockBit Black, and instructions to be followed for decryption.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5369 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"537\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>Fig. 8 â Modified Wallpaper</em></strong></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Unprotected systems in the network were brute-forced to run the PSEXEC tool for lateral movement across the systems.

In this technique, a call is made to the target to make them click on malicious links, leading them to install malware unknowingly.</p>\n<p>Threat actors like affiliates of ransomware groups have started to utilize this technique to infect targets across the world. They recruit callers who work on phishing campaigns, called the âCallback phishingâ technique. With the emergence of such methods, the search for so-called callers is also increasing. Additionally, new callers are making themselves available on the underground forums. The figure below illustrates an advertisement in one of the underground forums wherein the threat actor can be seen posting details of the âjobâ and inviting callers to join with a promise of revenue-sharing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-5525 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-300x81.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-300x81.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_-768x207.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caller_.png 955w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><i>Fig. 1 â Threat actor in search of caller services</i></em></p>\n<p>As evident from the above advertisement, RAT (Remote Administration Tool) stubs are provided to be installed specifically targeting carriers in the USA and UK.</p>\n<h2><strong><b>A Callerâs Perspective</b></strong></h2>\n<p>Callers provide their services based on the target and are willing to call as many times as necessary to succeed in their mission. Most services offer English callers as the US and UK are the most targeted locations by cybercrime groups, and they work actively every week. They compel the victims to click on malicious links and install a malicious executable through social engineering and phishing.</p>\n<p>Another technique explicitly used by these callers targeting various sectors is called Callback Phishing. They make phone calls through various SIM cards registered to different geographical locations. One such threat actor on telegram has multiple Russian SIM cards offering a higher success rate.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5526 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-300x24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"59\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-300x24.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-768x62.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749-1024x83.png 1024w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2022-12-22-143749.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><i>Fig. 2 â Threat actor offering caller services</i></em></p>\n<p>Some of these callers donât send phishing links to individual targets but operate on bulk orders based on the database provided to them. They make these calls from toll-free numbers like 800 or 888 for more credibility rather than using suspicious SIMs that might get blocked. The threat actors demand a premium price, the lowest being a thousand dollars that includes these toll-free numbers and a connection fee. A big chunk of the money goes as salaries to the operators who sit and call for âlong and efficientâ communication to make the target install the malicious payloads or click the phishing links that redirect to them.</p>\n<h2><strong><b>An Affiliateâs Perspective</b></strong></h2>\n<p>The threat actors on the forums eagerly seek to hire callers to encrypt the victimâs network. We have observed ransomware affiliates, working with Hive and Quantum, target companies in the manufacturing and legal sectors in the USA and Canada with more than $10M in revenue. Manufacturing being the most attacked sector doesnât come as a surprise. However, targeting the legal industry is not regular, indicating that threat actors will also pivot their victims based on their financial motives and geopolitical interests.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5527 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__-300x155.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__-300x155.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss3__.png 534w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><i>Fig. 3 â Spam Mail to fetch phone details</i></em></p>\n<p>These affiliates agree on a percentage of the ransom amount and provide a salary based on a long-term partnership. Sometimes even spam email formats are provided to get the targetâs name, contact number, email, and property address, where it imitates people from various companies such as Blue Raven Solar, and Zillow home loans, among others, to lure them. Once the target falls for the scam and provides these details, the callers start engaging conversations where they convince the victims to install payloads provided by these affiliates.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5528 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__-300x177.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__-300x177.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ss4__.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><i>Fig. 4 â Spam Mail to fetch personal details</i></em></p>\n<p>Instead of sending documents that contain malicious links, the affiliates provide ISO files as attachments, carrying the actual ransomware payloads in an encrypted format that can bypass detections.

In the past few years, ransomware has become a menace due to various platforms on the dark web offering ransomware as a service. One of the recent ransomware is called LockBit 3.0. It uses a double-extortion method first to encrypt the victim&#8217;s files and copy them onto another server.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is Ransomware?</li>\n<li>How does Ransomware work?</li>\n<li>How can you safeguard yourself against LockBit 3.0?</li>\n<li>How SEQRITE Can Help</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How does Ransomware Infection Work?</p>\n<p><strong>RansomwareÂ </strong>is a type of malicious software, more like a form of malware that encrypts computer data. Once the data is encrypted, the user is asked to pay a ransom to the attackers to unlock their data.</p>\n<p>Extortion through Ransomware involves stealing files and preventing access to them through encryption or blocking. It is similar to physical theft and ransom demands to release the items.</p>\n<p>Even after paying the ransom, there is no guarantee that the hacker will give you access to your files or that it won&#8217;t happen again.</p>\n<p><strong>The &#8220;WannaCry&#8221; ransomware attack from May 2017 is a classic example:</strong></p>\n<p>OverÂ <u><a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/todays-massive-ransomware-attack-was-mostly-preventable-heres-how-to-avoid-it/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">300,000 computers</a></u>Â worldwide, including government offices, police stations, hospitals, and ATMs, were affected during the 2017 attack. The problem was so severe that Microsoft extended security to support even older operating systems. The following year,Â <u><a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/tsmc-wannacry-ransomware-attack.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a></u>Â (TSMC) had to shut down 10,000 machines due to a new variant of WannaCry.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in 2022, ransomware called &#8220;<strong>LockBit 3.0</strong>&#8221; infected various systems. LockBit is self-spreading ransomware that uses a double extortion method to extract as much money as possible from the victims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Double-extortion method&#8221; implies that the users are demanded ransom twice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once to decrypt and access their files</li>\n<li>Another time to prevent their files from being distributed or sold on the internet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Various other ransomware has since spread and caused multiple individual and organizational losses.</p>\n<p>LockBit was discovered in 2019 and has since been used by its operators on a subscription basis through licenses acquired through the dark web. The most recent kind of LockBit has been dubbedÂ <strong>LockBit 3.0</strong>.</p>\n<p>TheÂ <strong>typical process of a LockBit 3.0 attack</strong>Â can be divided into three stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exploit</li>\n<li>Infiltrate</li>\n<li>Deploy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During theÂ <strong>exploitÂ </strong>stage, the victim might be a target of phishing and unknowingly download the malware. There is also the possibility of facing brute-force attacks on their network. Once the malware has entered the network, LockBit 3.0 ransomware prepares the system for encryption.</p>\n<p>Next, we have theÂ <strong>infiltrationÂ </strong>stage. LockBit 3.0 infects the victim&#8217;s PC. It escalates the program privileges to achieve this. It then terminates some critical system services, such as SecurityHealthSystray.exe. Additionally, various services are stopped and deleted to prevent the ransomware from getting traced.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5369\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg.png 750w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lockbit3.0-b.jpg-300x132.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, at theÂ <strong>deploymentÂ </strong>stage, it is ready to finish the process.

The user&#8217;s wallpaper is changed along with the instructions to read the ransom note prefixed by the exact string of characters.</p>\n<p>Who Can Be The Potential Target Of The LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Attack, And How Can It Create Various Challenges For Your Business?</p>\n<p>Anyone can be a potential target of a ransomware attack. Broadly, we can consider two categories of victims:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Individuals</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any method used to attack an individual can also strike a company on a larger scale.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Businesses</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any company with access to public servers is a potential target for ransomware attacks. Every company is, therefore, a potential target of this type of attack.</p>\n<p><strong>How Can This Create Different Challenges For Your Business?</strong></p>\n<p>Most ransomware attacks are designed to disrupt your company&#8217;s standard, day-to-day operations. All types of ransomware attacks pose different challenges to businesses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Productivity</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Productivity is a huge challenge that can impact your business. When your systems fail, your staff shuts down every day daily routines.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Compliance</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in an industry where compliance is high on your priority list, ransomware can make you non-compliant and even shut down your business.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Revenue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of ransomware attacks for businesses is lost revenue. This can be due to loss of productivity, legal lawsuits due to non-compliance, or loss of project-critical data.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Loss of customer confidence</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Becoming a victim of a ransomware attack can cause you to lose the trust of your customers and cost you a significant chunk of your business.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Safeguard Your Organization?</strong></p>\n<p>Now, what&#8217;s the solution? How to safeguard yourself and your organization from all these ransomware, malware, and cyberattacks without hindering your productivity, business compliance, and more?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple yet hard to follow. Why?</p>\n<p>Because you need to take care of details and keep a checklist ready to safeguard all your data, documents, files, and more from these malicious hackers and software, you need to have a cyber security solution that keeps your devices protected.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of 9 hygiene checks organizations should follow, even after buying a cyber security solution.</p>\n<p><strong>9 Hygiene checks organizations should do Even After buying cyber security solutions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Install Antivirus</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every day,Â <u><a href=\"https://www.osqa.net/antivirus-statistics-facts-and-insights-that-you-must-know/learn/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">350,000 viruses</a></u>Â are detected on laptops and computers. What do you think is the solution for this issue? Antivirus is! An antivirus gives your devices immunity to fight against ransomware, malware, or other cyber attackers. Take preventive actions today and install (and keep updated) antivirus on your business and personal devices.</p>\n<p>Installing antiviruses takes the first and foremost step to attaining protection from cyberattacks. But you can never be too sure that other malware attacks will not attack you. Thus, you must follow through with the entire checklist.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Stay Away From Pirated Software</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Copied software can never replace the original one. They lack authenticity, and the pirated version is also not 100% trustworthy. Instead, there can be a hidden virus in the pirated version of security software.</p>\n<p>Using pirated software is equal toÂ <u><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2016/04/IDCNUSFinalResearch.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">costing yourself billions</a></u>. This malicious software will create havoc in your system and damage your data. Therefore, you must not download or copy pirated versions of software.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Take Regular Backup</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/04/not-prepared-for-data-loss.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">58% of small businesses</a></u>Â are never prepared for data loss. Thus, never miss out on your backups &#8211; make it a habit to do a regular data backup every week or month and create a secure archive of all your essential documents and files.</p>\n<p>You should configure your cybersecurity solutions properly, select the files to be backed up based on their priority, and then take regular backups.</p>\n<p>With regular data backups, you will never lose your data to inevitable or unplanned situations like system corruption, malware infection, hard drive crash, and more. It will help you recover all your data quickly and seamlessly.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Avoid Clicking On Random Links</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Randomly clicking attacks on your devices can lead to ransomware or malware attacks. Your devices will covertly download software intended to damage or disable your computer.</p>\n<p>These random clicks can result in you being ghosted from your devices, your data being hostage to cyber attackers, leaking out your details, and getting access to all your personal information. Thus, quit clicking on random links.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Disable Macros In Unknown MS Office Documents</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Typically, macros are made for users to automate routine tasks like pulling data from different resources and compiling them in a single report. Of course, it makes life easy for you! But it also makes it easy for hackers to use malicious scripts in macros and exploit your computer.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the solution?</p>\n<p>Avoid enabling macros to unknown MS office documents, especially the ones you download from the web or unidentified emails, as it has the power to not only damage your computer but also leak out your personal information.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Audit Local/Domain Users And Remove Unwanted Users</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disabling, removing, or auditing stale or inactive user accounts from your organizations keeps your Active directory up-to-date and secure from insider attacks.</p>\n<p>According toÂ <u><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-ad/regularly-check-for-and-remove-inactive-user-accounts-in-active-directory\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft</a></u>, more than 10% of user accounts in your Active directory are either inactive or stale.</p>\n<p>Thus, it would help if you made an effort to keep your directory safe from attackers, as they can damage your data and enterprise more. A hacker can access stale accounts and use them to get into your system and hack your data.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Audit RDP &amp; SMB Access</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>RDP and SMB accesses are given to either traveling or remote workers. These two accesses permit employees to access networks from anywhere and communicate openly through an SMB protocol.</p>\n<p>As a responsible employee, you must audit your RDP &amp; SMB access by changing your credentials so that the company faces no security risks or threats. If not, cyber hackers will steal the employee account credentials to deploy malware in your ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Use Strong Password</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your passwords are your first defence systems. Thus, you must put extra effort into creating strong passwords for your computers and other devices. A more robust password will take more effort to decode from hackers.</p>\n<p>It will protect you from malicious software they want to deport to your computer systems. Thus, you must follow the rules for solid passwords, like using small and big alphabets and including a character and numerals. By adhering to some of these instructions, you can ensure the safety of your devices.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Use Secure VPN To Access Specific Ports</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A secure VPN allows you to create a safe funnel in your network to the outside internet and channel information through it. With VPN, you don&#8217;t need to export your ports to the outside internet.</p>\n<p>It also helps you to set up secure public Wi-Fi connections, stream blocked websites, avoid ISP tracking, and more. VPN provides 100% authenticity, security, and data privacy to save your devices from cyber-attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How Can SEQRITE Be Your Shield Partner In This Journey?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no guarantee that any of the above methods will work for you; Ransomware makers are constantly improving their products to stay ahead of cybersecurity.

Last year also confluence faced a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-26084) in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. The vulnerability arises from an OGNL injection flaw and allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on Confluence Server or Data Center instances.</p>\n<h3>What is an OGNL injection?</h3>\n<p>An open-source Expression Language (EL) for Java objects is called Object-Graph Navigation Language. In particular, OGNL allows the evaluation of EL expressions in Apache Struts, the popular framework for creating Java-based web applications in business settings. The most severe flaws in Apache Struts are related to OGNL expression injection attacks, which let invalidated expressions be evaluated against the value stack, giving an attacker the ability to change system variables or run arbitrary code.</p>\n<h3>Technical Analysis:</h3>\n<p>CVE-2022-26134 is a remote code execution vulnerability resulting in code execution in the context of the Confluence server. A threat actor looking to utilize this vulnerability will place the malicious payload in the URI of an HTTP request. Any HTTP method appears to work, whether valid (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) or invalid.</p>\n<p>The simplest form of a URL containing a malicious payload will be:</p>\n<p><strong>%24%7B%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%22touch%20/tmp/r7%22%29%7D/</strong></p>\n<p>Above, the exploit is URL-encoded.
