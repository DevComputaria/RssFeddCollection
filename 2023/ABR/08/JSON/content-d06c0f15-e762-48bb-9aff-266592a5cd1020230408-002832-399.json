And for many, the answer is terrifying: across the frontlines and scattered across Russia, a 6.6 million square mile country that has invaded their homeland. This is the result, Ukraine and international observers say, of a systematic effort at the highest levels of the Russian government to separate Ukrainian children from their families and their identity as Ukrainians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Russia has contended that it has relocated children in an effort to protect them, it does not appear to be making an effort to reunite the children with their parents. Instead, observers say, it appears to be working to erase their identity through re-education and integration into Russian families. </span><br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These accusations have led the International Criminal Court to <a href=\"https://time.com/6264280/vladimir-putin-icc-warrant-arrest/\" >charge Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> with <a href=\"https://time.com/6266991/ukraine-push-putin-war-crimes/\" >violations of international law</a>, alongside </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the Commissioner for Children&rsquo;s Rights&mdash;who adopted a Ukrainian child herself and is thought to be leading the program. Such crimes against children, some experts say, <a href=\"https://time.com/6262903/russia-ukraine-genocide-war-crimes/\" >may even be evidence of genocide</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are unable to rescue their children themselves must turn to others for help, including the charity Save Ukraine. Founded in 2014, the NGO has helped about 90,000 people escape the conflict in the last year. It also provided many families with short and long-term shelter and rehabilitation services to help them rebuild their lives, including trauma therapy, education and job services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Save Ukraine launched an even more daunting project: rescuing Ukrainian children who have been taken into Russia and Russian-occupied territory, says Save Ukraine&rsquo;s founder, Mykola Kubela, who served as the children&rsquo;s ombudsman for the president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2021. Traveling by plane or bus, it has shepherded dozens of desperate relatives through Poland and Belarus to circumvent the front lines and then into enemy territory. Over the last year the group says they&#8217;ve brought 95 children home from Russia and Russian-occupied territory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kuleba, while there are still thousands of children to be saved, their work is only becoming more difficult. A Ukrainian</span><a href=\"https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">national database</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has identified over 19,000 children who have been deported to Russia, and the locations of thousands more is unknown. And as time goes by, Kuleba says that children are becoming harder to find as Russia works to erase their identities, including by placing them in adoptive families and changing their names.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuleba spoke to TIME in March from a Save the Children&rsquo;s shelter in Kyiv&mdash;where 200 women and children are currently living&mdash;about the obstacles his organization faces rescuing thousands of others.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. </span></i></p>\n<h3>TIME: How do you bring children back from Russia?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kubela: It is a very complicated process. It&#8217;s very hard to find these children if they are in Russia. They try to hide the children, or they send the children to Russian families to adopt them, place them under guardianship or foster care.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just yesterday, we returned one child&mdash;a 14-year-old boy, Konstantin&mdash;from Anapa, in Russia. He was abducted from occupied territory in the Kherson region; he&rsquo;d been in a reeducation camp for several months. The Russians said they will not return him, and if nobody comes, he will be adopted. He only had a father, but he&rsquo;s very sick, and he had several sisters, and they were afraid to go to Russia. They&rsquo;re a very poor family, and they had to spend thousands of dollars to cross several borders to reach Anapa.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?w=560&w=560\" alt=\"RUSSIA-POLITICS-RIGHTS\" srcset=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg 1024w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=768,491 768w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=600,383 600w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=550,351 550w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=280,179 280w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=560,358 560w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=419,268 419w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=838,535 838w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=407,260 407w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=814,520 814w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=190,121 190w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=380,243 380w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=263,168 263w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=526,336 526w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=61,39 61w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=640,409 640w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=760,485 760w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=700,447 700w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=1000,639 1000w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=49,31 49w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=840,536 840w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=1012,646 1012w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=320,204 320w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=730,466 730w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=192,123 192w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=391,250 391w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=479,306 479w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=958,612 958w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=767,490 767w, https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1247187786.jpg?resize=800,511 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Mikhail Metzel&mdash;Sputnik/AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=\"caption\" >Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Maria Lvova-Belova, Russian children&#8217;s rights commissioner, at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, on February 16, 2023.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[His 18-year-old sister] was in a group of mothers and relatives that rescued 17 children. [She] successfully reached the facility, and we helped her to negotiate there. He had been in a foster family for two weeks. They brainwashed him, and when she found him, he told her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to return to Ukraine. My parents told me that if I return back, Ukrainian Nazis will kill me because I was in Russia.&rdquo; He told her, &ldquo;if I agree to receive status as an orphan, the Russian government will help me. They will give me a flat; they will keep giving me money; they will put me in a technical school.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She worked with him for three days. She told him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. I&rsquo;m your sister, your father is dying. He wants to be with you.&rdquo; She worked with him for three days to convince him that he can successfully and safely return to Ukraine. And just yesterday, they crossed the border. </span></p>\n<h3>What kind of obstacles do you face?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the time, we have to change our routes, because every time, the Russians try to block our missions. We do it differently every time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can&rsquo;t tell you a lot, but we have guys who were arrested in Belarus. It&rsquo;s very dangerous for anybody who tries to help anything having to do with Ukrainians there. That&#8217;s why we have to carefully plan our missions, because it could be very dangerous for these mothers and for children, or for any people who can provide support.</span></p>\n<h3>How do you locate children in Russian territory?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use different tools. First of all, we have a hotline through which we receive information from people who are in Ukraine or abroad. Because we&rsquo;re the biggest NGO in Ukraine who provides rescue missions, rescuing people from combat zones, many people know us and send us information about children who were deported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very often, the children who were returned report to us about other children who stayed in their facilities in Russia or Crimea, and then we find their relatives. Or, when relatives ask us to find a child, we find them through other children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just two hours ago, I talked with a journalist who told me she knows the father of a boy being held in a facility in Russia. We recognized information about that boy&mdash;we just returned another child from the facility who knew the boy was being held there, and they&rsquo;re communicating through social media. Our next steps will be to communicate with the father, and take him on our next rescue mission. And to return that boy from the Russian Federation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Very many children who are staying in Russia don&rsquo;t know where their parents are. We try to find their parents, but they could be in occupied territories, or in the Russian Federation, or they could have been killed. Or imprisoned. They could be in filtration camps. Sometimes we know information about the child, but we don&#8217;t know anything about the parents.</span></p>\n<h3>Does paperwork pose a problem?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. For example, we prepare international passports for all these parents. For many of them, it&rsquo;s their first trip to Russia or to Europe&mdash;because we go through Poland, Belarus. They are very poor families, and very often, they have no documents. That&rsquo;s why we have to help them to receive documents for a child, and receive legal permission from different government organizations. Without documents, it&rsquo;s impossible to bring a child back.</span></p>\n<h3>If children are orphans, or if you can&rsquo;t find their parents, are you thinking about ways to bring them back in the future?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s a very hard question. Last year, Putin signed legislation in May which simplifies receiving Russian citizenship, to simplify the procedure of adoption. Through the adoption process, Russia can change the last name and date of birth of any child to give them Russian citizenship. After that, the child can disappear in Russia&mdash;especially little kids. That&#8217;s why we have to hurry to return them to Ukraine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is our goal to raise awareness about what Russia is doing with our children, with our families, how they try to destroy Ukrainian identity and Russify our children. It is genocide.</span></p>\n<h3>What do you think the world needs to do to bring the children home?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, to help us to fight with Russia, to de-occupy our territories, to clean our land from Russia. Second&mdash;the ICC&rsquo;s decision on President Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova was a very good sign for us, because it was the beginning of the process of punishing them as war criminals. After that, maybe we will receive our children back, and they will be returned.</span></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6268214"}},{"title":"The Messy Politics and High Costs of Indonesia’s Anti-Israel FIFA Fiasco","link":"https://time.com/6269303/indonesia-fifa-u20-world-cup-impacts/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Chad de Guzman / Singapore"},"pubDate":"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 02:00:11 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"indonesia"},{"#cdata-section":"News Team"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6269303"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Staging the FIFA Under-20 World Cup was meant to be a badge of pride for Indonesia.

Dorsey hedged when asked to forecast the weight that it may bear on Indonesia&rsquo;s electorate, which is scheduled to vote for new leaders in February 2024 and appears to prioritize more core concerns like infrastructure and inflation. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know that this [losing the U-20 World Cup] is going to be a big issue a month from now, let alone eight or nine months,&rdquo; Dorsey tells TIME. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s much bigger fish to fry.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if the inundation of </span><a href=\"https://en.tempo.co/read/1708886/public-vent-on-ganjar-pranowos-social-media-over-u-20-world-cup-fiasco\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Ganjar&rsquo;s social media </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posts</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are any indication, his popularity has already begun to take a hit. Indonesian public sentiment towards Israel is not exactly warm&mdash;a </span><a href=\"https://globescan.com/2017/07/04/sharp-drop-in-world-views-of-us-uk-global-poll/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 GlobeScan poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the BBC World Service showed only 9% of the country views Israel positively. In recent years, the Palestinian cause has become more entwined with </span><a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/how-gaza-occupies-indonesia-s-identity-wars\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indonesia&rsquo;s identity politics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as the public increasingly cleaves between hard-liner Muslims and more moderate followers of Islam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of the U-20 World Cup, however, it appears the public was willing to let go of identity politics for the sake of sport: a national phone survey conducted in March <a href=\"https://fulcrum.sg/pdi-ps-own-goal-controversy-over-indonesias-loss-as-u-20-fifa-world-cup-host/\"  target=\"_blank\">found</a> that a majority of Indonesians wanted the country to host the tournament </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even with Israel&#8217;s participat</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ion</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (Ironically, those who were most open to Israel playing on their soil were PDI-P voters, suggesting Ganjar may have spurned his own base).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ganjar is not the only one whose political future might be impacted though. Erick Thohir, the minister of state-owned enterprises and recently-appointed PSSI chairperson, has reportedly been eyeing the vice presidency in 2024. Thohir, who was the point-person for dealings with FIFA throughout the whole hosting fracas over the last month, told Indonesian reporters last week that he will &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://en.antaranews.com/news/277296/erick-thohir-vows-to-work-hard-to-avoid-fifas-sanctions\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work hard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo; to renegotiate the penalties and avoid severe additional sanctions that may further dent the economy. Thohir, a business magnate who has formerly owned soccer teams Inter Milan and D.C. United, </span><a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/indonesia/2023/03/27/erick-thohirs-popularity-grows-as-potential-vp-candidate.html\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trails behind</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil and Sandiaga Uno, the tourism minister, in pre-election vice presidential surveys, but he had steadily gained prominence in the lead-up to the U-20 tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event surely would have boosted Thohir&rsquo;s electability, says A&rsquo;an. Considering that no party has yet set sights on taking Thohir in for the upcoming polls, A&rsquo;an thinks that Thohir might be the most doomed by the FIFA fallout, saying that the chairperson &ldquo;has no other avenue or stepping stone.&rdquo;</span></p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6269303"}},{"title":"India’s School Textbooks Are the Latest Battleground for Hindu Nationalism","link":"https://time.com/6269349/india-textbook-changes-controversy-hindu-nationalism/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Sanya Mansoor"},"pubDate":"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 01:00:39 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"India"},{"#cdata-section":"News Team"},{"#cdata-section":"Second click"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6269349"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"Indian students in class 12 relying on NCERT textbooks will no longer study chapters based on the Mughal empire."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6269349\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6269349/india-textbook-changes-controversy-hindu-nationalism/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School textbooks have become the latest battleground for Hindu nationalism in India, as education officials have deleted key passages about Muslim rule during the Mughal empire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The textbooks, released in early April, are missing sections that covered hundreds of years of the Mughal empire, the 2002 Gujarat riots in which hundreds of Muslims died while current Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister, and the assassination of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was targeted</span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/06/godse-cult-gandhi-assassin-india/661154/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by a Hindu extremist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">India&rsquo;s National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) announced changes to the syllabus last April, which recently sparked a backlash from critics on social media. Indian students in class 12 relying on NCERT textbooks will no longer study chapters based on the Mughal empire, which was in power from the early 1500s until the mid 1700s. NCERT textbooks are used by <a href=\"https://thewire.in/education/ncert-mughal-empire-gujarat-riots-class-12\"  target=\"_blank\">thousands of schools</a> across the country, and t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he country&#8217;s most populous state,</span><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/news/up-schools-to-adopt-revised-ncert-books-no-lessons-on-mughal-courts-101680577787351.html\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uttar Pradesh</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, recently announced that it would be using these textbooks for the school year</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that began this week. </span><br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani blamed the cuts on a &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/chapter-on-mughals-not-dropped-rationalised-to-reduce-pressure-on-students-during-covid-ncert-598306.html\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rationalization process</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo; prompted by COVID-19 and the need to lighten the workload for students. &#8220;They recommended that if this chapter is dropped, it won&#8217;t affect the knowledge of the children and an unnecessary burden can be removed,&#8221; Saklani said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the changes to the textbooks fit into a larger trend pushed by the BJP in Indian politics that emphasizes India as a nation of one religion, experts say. &ldquo;They are saying there&rsquo;s nothing political about it. But it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with COVID,&#8221; says Aditya Mukherjee, an Indian historian who taught at Jawaharlal Nehru University for more than four decades. &#8220;It has all got to do with their politics.&rdquo; The newspaper </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indian Express</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which published investigations on the omissions</span><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/express-investigation-part-1-from-emergency-to-gujarat-riots-lessons-of-past-deleted-from-textbooks-of-future-7976207/\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when the changes were first announced, and again</span><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/education/references-to-gujarat-riots-purged-from-social-science-books-for-ncert-classes-6-12-8538768/\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier this week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, criticized the NCERT&rsquo;s &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/history-textbook-deletions-ncert-argument-weak-8542044/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weak</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo; justification. In a scathing editorial, they wrote that the government wishes to &ldquo;escape unpalatable facts.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power since 2014, is employing a</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategy to win the next general elections in 2024 by consolidating the Hindu vote through cementing the narrative that Hindus are under threat from Muslims, says Harbans Mukhia, a historian of medieval India. India&rsquo;s Hindus make up about </span><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/21/key-findings-about-the-religious-composition-of-india/\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80% of the country&rsquo;s population</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; Muslims account for 14%. The new textbook guidelines are just the latest in a series of policies designed to erase or belittle Muslim contributions to Indian society while simultaneously glorifying Hindus, historians argue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some BJP leaders have defended the textbook changes, including </span><a

Mishra</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who applauded in an April 3</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet that Mughal emperors are &ldquo;not in the history books, they are in the dustbin.&rdquo; Modi spoke broadly last year about how Indian history was full of &ldquo;</span><a

fighting, historians worry about the effect on students who will use these altered textbooks in school. &ldquo;You cannot understand modern India without the Mughals&mdash;so it seems to be a silly and self-defeating embrace of ignorance about one&#8217;s own origin,&rdquo; says Audrey Truschke, associate professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University. &ldquo;Erasing Mughals from textbooks does not erase them from India&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\"

British colonization, and Mughal influence still permeates Indian culture. When India became independent in 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru delivered his speech at the</span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Fort\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red Fort</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan&rsquo;s rule. In fact, Mughals built many of India&rsquo;s famous monuments, including the Taj Mahal. They helped make biryani and many everyday spices popular.</span><a href=\"https://www.invertisuniversity.ac.in/pdf/Institutional-LMS/Fashion%20Designing/MUGHAL%20PERIOD%20COSTUME.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional dress</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as men&rsquo;s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kurta pajama</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and women&rsquo;s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shalwar kameez</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, became common during the empire. Under Mughal rule,</span><a href=\"https://theprint.in/pageturner/how-the-golden-era-of-kathak-began-during-the-mughal-rule-under-akbar/262724/\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kathak</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dance flourished and so did Indian classical music. Many Indian languages, including Urdu and Hindi, evolved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This isn&#8217;t the first time India has fought over the contents of its textbooks. NCERT was created in 1961 after Indian independence; it assigned a committee of historians and academics to holistically document the country&#8217;s history in school textbooks. But the BJP and right-wing Hindu parties have repeatedly tried to change NCERT&#8217;s books over the years, including attempts</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the 1970s and early 2000s that were unsuccessful following protests from historians.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 2000s, the hardline Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which Modi used to belong, prompted the NCERT to delete sections on the oppression of lower caste Indians as well as Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s assassination by</span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/30/india-gandhis-killer-godse-never-left-rss-claims-new-book\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathuram Godse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who some historians say was an</span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/30/india-gandhis-killer-godse-never-left-rss-claims-new-book\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RSS member</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (The current textbooks mention the murder but leave out key context about the Hindu right&rsquo;s influence on the killer.) Mukherjee was among a handful of historians to publish a detailed booklet documenting the numerous errors in those textbooks from the early 2000s, which helped get those books thrown out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NCERT&#8217;s current efforts to strike Mughal history from school textbooks comes amid a series of other moves aimed at obscuring Muslim influence in India, including the changing of city names to erase Muslim or Mughal origins, hyper nationalist Bollywood films and politicians fusing Hindu mythology with history; and</span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/asia/india-hindu-extremist-groups-intl-hnk-dst/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open calls for genocide of Muslims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from religious leaders going unpunished. &ldquo;Globally, whenever a particular community is demonized over a long period of time, when they are erased from history, these are signs of an </span><a href=\"https://time.com/6103284/india-hindu-supremacy-extremism-genocide-bjp-modi/\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impending genocide</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,&rdquo; says Aditya Mukherjee, an Indian historian who taught at Jawaharlal Nehru University for more than four decades and has closely followed efforts to communalize textbooks. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t happen all of a sudden. It is preceded by this kind of isolation of a community&hellip;so that in ordinary life people&hellip;don&rsquo;t read their history; all they hear about them is how they are terrorists.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the absence of sound history being taught in schools, some organizations are trying to provide an accurate portrayal in other ways. Eshan Sharma,</span><a href=\"https://www.karwaanheritage.in/aboutus\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">founder of Karwaan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a student-led history collective, features free conversations with prominent historians, which are available online. &ldquo;The internet is a liberal medium; it allows you to create a repository that could be looked at by generations long after we are gone,&rdquo; says Sharma</span>. (<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharma is also a fan of the memes that have emerged over the textbook controversy; one depicts a theory that the Taj Mahal must have been built by aliens, since the Mughals weren&rsquo;t around.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But efforts like Sharma&#8217;s may not be enough to match the influence of the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NCERT textbooks used throughout the country. &ldquo;Unless there is a political change, we are not going to be able to combat this,&rdquo; says Mukherjee.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Correction, April 7</strong></p>\n<p><em>T</em><em>he original version of this story misstated Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s role as an official in Gujarat.

Lawmakers will only be able to read those studies inside highly-secured rooms on the Capitol grounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The catastrophic withdrawal has continued to serve as one of the biggest black marks on Biden&#8217;s record as President, as it undermined one of his main pitches to voters&mdash;that he would bring sound decision-making and professionalism back to the White House after four years of messy disruption under Trump. As both Biden and Trump gear up for a potential rematch in 2024, the withdrawal from Afghanistan is sure to resurface as a focus of attack lines, as each tries to pin the blame for the ugly departure on the other.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://time.com/6090523/biden-afghanistan-withdrawal-taliban/\" ><em>Biden&#8217;s Botched Withdrawal Plunges Afghanistan Into Chaos</em></a></p>\n<p>The White House report acknowledged that not starting evacuations from Afghanistan earlier was a mistake, as well as not sharing intelligence more broadly about the deteriorating security situation on the ground and not doing enough planning for a worst case scenario in Afghanistan. The Biden administration says it learned lessons from those experiences that it applied in other conflict zones soon after.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We now prioritize earlier evacuations when faced with a degrading security situation,&#8221; the White House report says, pointing to subsequent evacuations in Ethiopia and Ukraine as threats mounted in those countries. In November 2021, amid escalating violence around Ethiopia&rsquo;s capital city of Addis Ababa, the US withdrew most personnel from the Embassy, over objections from the Ethiopian government. In Ukraine, the US withdrew personnel about two weeks before Russia began rolling tanks toward Kyiv.</p>\n<p>The experience in Afghanistan also affected how the administration handles intelligence amid escalating threats. &#8220;In a destabilizing security environment, we now err on the side of aggressive communication about risks,&#8221; the White House review says. Regarding Ukraine, the administration released intelligence early to allies, and eventually made their concerns public weeks before the Russian invasion. Ukrainian government officials objected to that approach at the time, the review states, over concerns it would spark panic inside the country. Biden did it anyway, and believes it helped mobilize allies and support for Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Also during that period in early 2022, as Russian troops were mustering on Ukraine&rsquo;s borders, the experience in Afghanistan inspired the Biden administration to set up a small group of experts which they called a &#8220;tiger team&rdquo; to make plans for worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<p>The White House review reserved its most scathing assessments for the Trump Administration, blaming Biden&#8217;s predecessor for agreeing to the US withdrawal in the first place and leaving it to the next administration to execute it.</p>\n<p>Trump told the Taliban that the U.S. military would leave the country in 2021, but Trump left &#8220;no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans or Afghan allies,&#8221; the review said. When Biden took office, the review states, &ldquo;the Taliban were in the strongest military position that they had been in since 2001, controlling or contesting half of the country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the United States had only 2,500 troops on the ground&mdash;the lowest number of troops in Afghanistan since 2001.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report also dinged the previous administration for gutting the US visa process, thereby creating a <a href=\"https://time.com/6086795/afghanistan-taliban-journalist-visa/\" >massive backlog</a> that held up the departures of thousands of Afghans who had worked with Americans and needed to seek safety from the Taliban outside the country.</p>\n"},"post-id":{"@xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1","#text":"6269392"}},{"title":"Film Star Shah Rukh Khan Wins the 2023 TIME100 Reader Poll","link":"https://time.com/6269128/shah-rukh-khan-time100-reader-poll-2023/","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"TIME Staff"},"pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 18:52:59 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Uncategorized"},{"#cdata-section":"sponsorshipblock"},{"#cdata-section":"T100PollResults23"},{"#cdata-section":"TIME 100"},{"#cdata-section":"TIME100 2023"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://time.com/?p=6269128"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"With more than 1.2 million votes cast, Khan came in first with 4% of the vote."},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<aside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"><div class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-6269128\"></div></div><br />\n<div class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/6269128/shah-rukh-khan-time100-reader-poll-2023/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"></div></aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan won the 2023 TIME100 poll, in which readers voted for the individuals they felt most deserved a spot on <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TIME&rsquo;s annual list</a> of the most influential people. </span></p>\n<p>Stars and noteworthy figures also featured on the poll included actor <a href=\"https://time.com/icon-of-the-year-2022-michelle-yeoh/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michelle Yeoh</a>, athlete <a href=\"https://time.com/6208915/serena-williams-retirement-interview/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Serena Williams</a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva.

Though the holy month is perhaps best known as a time of fasting, during which </span><a href=\"https://time.com/6265105/ramadan-why-not-all-muslims-fast/\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">those who are able</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to fast refrain from eating and drinking (yes, </span><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even water</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) during daylight hours, the month is about so much more. Ramadan marks the ninth and most sacred month of the Islamic <a href=\"https://time.com/4355437/ramadan-2016-starts/\" >lunar calendar</a>, during which Muslims believe that the Quran, the Islamic holy book, was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p>\n<p><b>Read More</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><a href=\"https://time.com/6265105/ramadan-why-not-all-muslims-fast/\" ><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Not All Observant Muslims Fast During Ramadan</span></i></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While fasting is certainly one component of the month, it is hardly the sole motivation. Ramadan is a time of spiritual discipline that is dedicated to prayer, charity (Muslims are highly encouraged to give charity, or <em>zakat</em>, during the month), and self reflection. Indeed, Muslims are not only expected to fast from food and drink, but also more unsavory habits such as swearing, gossiping, and holding grudges. Ramadan is also a time of celebration and community gathering, whether it&rsquo;s for predawn breakfasts (known in Arabic as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suhoor</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), post-sunset feasts (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iftar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), or special nighttime prayers in the Mosque called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taraweeh</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although their experience is undoubtedly different, these kinds of benefits don&rsquo;t elude non-Muslim participants. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re fasting, you get an immense sense of clarity of mind and you become a lot less anxious,&rdquo; wrote Ruth Medjber, an Arab-Irish photographer from a Muslim and Catholic family who chronicled her experience fasting for Ramadan as an atheist in a 2021 piece for the </span><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/why-a-non-muslim-like-me-observes-ramadan-1.4552139\"  target=\"_blank\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irish Times</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &ldquo;During the month of Ramadan, I&rsquo;m forced to slow down. I simply don&rsquo;t have the energy to carry on working at my full, maniacal speed.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;I genuinely like the experience because it&rsquo;s good discipline&mdash;like a refresh for the year,&rdquo; says Sless. As he sees it, &ldquo;You have 11 months to do whatever you want and it&rsquo;s just a nice cleanse.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Sless has had the occasional criticism over his Ramadan videos&mdash;including by some who have suggested that non-Muslims fasting for Ramadan constitutes a kind of cultural appropriation&mdash;he says that the vast majority of the response has been positive, particularly from other Muslims. And while some Muslims rightly caution against trivializing Ramadan or making it out to be &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/non-muslims-ramadan-health-fad-fasting-421562\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just another quirky health fad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,&rdquo; others argue that the inclusion of non-Muslims in the holy month should be more encouraged&mdash;if not to bring them closer to the faith, then at least to instill a great sense of familiarity and understanding of Muslims and what they stands for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is sorely needed. Anti-Muslim sentiment is a prevalent form of hate&mdash;this year, both the </span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/items/774811/en\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European Union</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2023/01/26/prime-minister-announces-appointment-canadas-first-special\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> appointed officials tasked with addressing it.

China considers self-ruling Taiwan its sovereign territory and abhors any ties it has with foreign officials. When Tsai met McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, in Taipei last year, </span><a href=\"https://time.com/6203124/nancy-pelosi-leaves-taiwan/\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beijing responded</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with unprecedented military drills, a trade embargo, and diplomatic freeze.</span><br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, China had</span><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3215992/beijing-condemns-taiwanese-president-tsai-ing-wens-sneaky-transit-us-and-warns-resolute-response\"  target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of a &ldquo;resolute response&rdquo; to the Simi Valley meeting, which while officially unofficial, was the first of its kind on U.S. soil since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. The U.S. was &ldquo;playing with fire&rdquo; over Taiwan, Xu Xueyuan, charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires at Beijing&rsquo;s embassy in the U.S., </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65120501\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told reporters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the reality has been more muted. After isolated military exercises on Tuesday, 14 Chinese warplanes and three warships had been spotted near Taiwan on Wednesday, with two entering the southwest of the island&rsquo;s air defense identification zone. On Thursday, China&rsquo;s second aircraft carrier, the Shandong, was </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/6/china-aircraft-carrier-in-drills-near-taiwan-amid-rising-tension\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spotted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 200 nautical miles (370 km) off Taiwan&rsquo;s east coast. It&#8217;s nothing compared with the belligerent reaction to Pelosi&rsquo;s visit, when five days of live-fire drills and missile tests completely encircled Taiwan, some less than 10 miles from its coast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift in messaging is telling and deliberate: firstly, that Tsai&rsquo;s decision to meet McCarthy in the U.S., rather than Taipei, is less of an affront and therefore requires less of a response; and, by extension, that the islanders have agency in cross-Strait ties. The latter is important as presidential elections approach in January, when how to manage relations with China will dominate campaigning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Cross-Strait relations are going to become much more of a front and center issue in Taiwan&#8217;s politics,&rdquo; says Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Global Taiwan Institute think tank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsai is ineligible to stand for a third term. Still, her China-skeptic Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is loathed by Beijing, which would rather see the pro-China Nationalists, or KMT, return to power instead. The last KMT stint before Tsai&rsquo;s 2016 victory was a time of flourishing ties based on the 1992 Consensus&mdash;a political fudge that both Beijing and Taipei agree that they belong to the same country, even if they disagree over which is the legitimate authority. Tsai&rsquo;s DPP doesn&rsquo;t recognize the 1992 Consensus, craving formal independence for the island of 23 million, even if it has pragmatically backburned that goal given China vows to respond with invasion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&rsquo;s little question which party&rsquo;s standpoint better reflects Taiwan&rsquo;s people. According to a March </span><a href=\"https://www.tpof.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230321-TPOF-March-2023-Public-Opinion-Poll-%E2%80%93-English-Excerpt.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF), 78% of islanders describe themselves as Taiwanese, rather than Chinese or some mix. However, fears of war with China are also high&mdash;and so the question of identity cannot be separated from that of security. The KMT will try to leverage deteriorating cross-Strait relations to convince voters that they are better placed to safeguard Taiwan&rsquo;s de facto independence.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A Visit on the Other Side</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some 6,000 miles from Simi Valley, another Taiwan presidential visit of sorts took place this week: that of Ma Ying-jeou, Tsai&rsquo;s KMT predecessor, who led a honeymoon period of cross-Strait ties from 2008 to 2016, during which he inked 23 trade treaties and opened direct flights, and business and educational exchanges proliferated. On March 27, Ma embarked on an unprecedented 12-day, five-city tour of China, including paying his respect to the graves of ancestors. It&rsquo;s the first time a former president of Taiwan has ever been invited to the People&#8217;s Republic and, while also officially unofficial, included a meeting with the head of China&#8217;s Taiwan Affairs office. &ldquo;We all belong to the Chinese race,&rdquo; Ma said in Nanjing on March 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ma&rsquo;s mainland visit has been carefully stage-managed by Beijing to show Taiwan voters that another trajectory for cross-Strait ties is possible under the KMT. To that end, Beijing in recent weeks has lifted import bans on Taiwanese agricultural products and resumed some direct flights across the Strait. The KMT will be keen to contrast this nascent rapprochement to Taiwan&rsquo;s diminishing international status under Tsai. Since she took office in 2016, the island has lost nine diplomatic allies to Beijing, most recently</span> <a

life, we understand we need to build up our defenses, but at the same time we see the value and wisdom in communication.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"><img

But the situation remained combustible as Muslims marked the Ramadan holy month and Jews began the weeklong Passover holiday. Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip renewed their rocket fire at Israel, raising fears of a wider conflagration.</p>\n<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent reported at least six people were injured in the latest violence. The Islamic Waqf authorities, which manages the compound, said police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.<br />\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<p>The Israeli police said that &ldquo;dozens of law-breaking juveniles&rdquo; had fomented chaos, throwing rocks and other objects at officers and compelling police to act to restore &ldquo;security, law and order.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More Palestinians had gathered in the mosque, responding to calls by Waqf to pray inside overnight. At one of the mosque entrances, police officers could be seen escorting dozens of Palestinians out of the compound. Residents and shoppers milled around, watching social media videos on their phones showing the renewed clashes that had happened just meters away.</p>\n<p>Early on Wednesday, Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque, firing stun grenades at Palestinians who hurled stones and firecrackers in a burst of violence during a sensitive holiday season. Palestinian militants in Gaza responded with rocket fire on southern Israel, prompting repeated Israeli airstrikes.</p>\n<p>The violence had calmed by early Wednesday morning, but in the evening, Palestinian militants fired two more rockets from Gaza, with one falling short inside Gaza and the other falling near the security fence separating Gaza from Israel, the Israeli military said. There were no reports of casualties.</p>\n<p>The mosque sits in a hilltop compound sacred to both Jews and Muslims, and conflicting claims over it have spilled into violence before, including a bloody 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza. Al-Aqsa is the third-holiest site in Islam and stands in a spot known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which is the holiest site in Judaism.</p>\n<p>Palestinian militant groups warned that further confrontation was coming, but a Palestinian official said the Palestinian Authority was in contact with officials in Egypt, Jordan, the United States and at the United Nations to de-escalate the situation. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media.</p>\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was working to &ldquo;calm tensions&#8221; at the holy site.</p>\n<p>People who were detained at the compound and later released said police used batons, chairs, rifles and whatever else they could find to strike Palestinians, including women and children, who responded by hurling stones and setting off firecrackers that they&#8217;d brought to evening prayers for fear of possible clashes. Outside the mosque&rsquo;s gate, police dispersed crowds of young men with stun grenades and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Medics from the Palestinian Red Crescent said that at least 50 people were injured. Israeli police said they were not immediately able to confirm the reports and videos showing officers beating Palestinians but said 350 were arrested. They added that one officer was injured in the leg.</p>\n<p>Separately, the Israeli military said one soldier was shot and moderately wounded in the occupied West Bank.</p>\n<p>Most of the Palestinians arrested from Al-Aqsa were released from detention by the early afternoon, said lawyer Khaled Zabarqa, who represents several of them. But he said that some 50 Palestinians, many of them from the occupied West Bank, were still detained and would have their cases heard at the Ofer military court on Friday. He put the total number of arrested at 450.</p>\n<p>U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland said he was &ldquo;appalled by the images of violence&rdquo; at Al-Aqsa, condemning the beating and mass arrests of Palestinians as well as reports of Palestinians stockpiling firecrackers and rocks.</p>\n<p>Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, expressed &ldquo;outrage and condemnation&rdquo; at the attack, telling reporters at U.N. headquarters: &ldquo;It is the right of the Palestinian Muslim worshippers to exercise their religious duties and prayers in this holy month of Ramadan, and in any other time in this holy Aqsa Mosque.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Crowds of Palestinians gathered around a police station in Jerusalem on Wednesday, waiting anxiously for their loved ones to trickle out of detention. Amin Risheq, a 19-year-old from east Jerusalem, said that after being beaten and forced to lay on the floor of the mosque with dozens of others, his hands zip-tied behind his back, he was taken to the police station where he said he did not have access to a toilet, medical attention or water for over six hours.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They treated us like animals,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Since Ramadan began March 22, scores of Muslim worshippers have repeatedly tried to stay overnight in the mosque, a practice that is typically permitted only during the last 10 days of the monthlong holiday. Israeli police have entered nightly to evict the worshippers.</p>\n<p>Tensions have been further heightened by calls from Jewish ultranationalists to carry out a ritual slaughter of a goat in the compound, as happened in ancient times.</p>\n<p>Israel bars ritual slaughter on the site, but calls by Jewish extremists to revive the practice, including offers of cash rewards to anyone who even attempts to bring an animal into the compound, have amplified fears among Muslims that Israel is plotting to take over the site.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu repeated Wednesday that he&#8217;s committed to preserving the longstanding arrangement at the compound. He described the worshippers who locked themselves in the mosque as &ldquo;extremists&rdquo; who prevented Muslims from entering the mosque peacefully.</p>\n<p>Over a hundred religious Jews filtered through the site on Wednesday during regular morning visiting hours, as small crowds of Muslims gathered around them shouting, &ldquo;God is greater!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jews are permitted to visit the compound, but not pray there, under longstanding agreements. But such visits, which have grown in numbers in recent years, have often raised tensions, particularly because some Jews are often seen quietly praying.</p>\n<p>After some 80,000 worshippers attended evening prayers at the mosque on Tuesday, hundreds of Palestinians barricaded themselves inside overnight to pray. Some said they wanted to ensure religious Jews didn&#8217;t carry out animal sacrifices. After they refused to leave, Israeli police moved into the mosque.</p>\n<p>Israeli police said &ldquo;several law-breaking youths and masked agitators&rdquo; brought fireworks, sticks and stones into the mosque, chanting insults and locking the front doors. &ldquo;After many and prolonged attempts to get them out by talking to no avail, police forces were forced to enter the compound,&rdquo; police said.</p>\n<p>Moayad Abu Mayaleh, 23, said he blocked a door of the mosque with hundreds of others to prevent the police from entering before they broke in.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let them get away with this,&rdquo; he said, shouting insults at Israeli police as he left the station.</p>\n<p>In the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian leadership denounced the attack on the worshippers as a violation that &ldquo;will lead to a large explosion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Palestinian militants responded to the events by firing a barrage of rockets from Gaza into southern Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the region as residents prepared to begin the weeklong Passover holiday.</p>\n<p>The Israeli military said a total of five rockets were fired, and all were intercepted. Israel responded with airstrikes that the army said hit Hamas weapons storage and manufacturing sites.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want this to escalate,&rdquo; said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an army spokesman. But he said that if the rocket fire persisted, &ldquo;we will respond very aggressively.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad called for Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Israel to gather around the Al-Aqsa Mosque and confront Israeli forces. Palestinians must be prepared &ldquo;for the inevitable confrontation in the coming days,&#8221; said Ziyad al-Nakhala, leader of Islamic Jihad.</p>\n<p>As violence unfolded in Jerusalem, the Israeli military reported fighting in a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank. It said residents of Beit Umar, near the volatile city of Hebron, burned tires, hurled rocks and explosives at soldiers. It said one soldier was shot by armed suspects, who managed to flee.</p>\n<p>It said later in the day that Palestinians opened fire at a checkpoint near the northern West Bank city of Jenin, leaving no casualties.</p>\n<p>Israeli-Palestinian violence has surged over the last year, as the Israeli military has carried out near-nightly raids on Palestinian cities, towns and villages and as Palestinians have staged numerous attacks against Israelis.</p>\n<p>At least 88 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire this year, according to an Associated Press tally. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed 15 people in the same period.</p>\n<p>Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were militants. But stone-throwing youths and bystanders uninvolved in violence were also among the dead. All but one of the Israeli dead were civilians.</p>\n<p>&mdash;<em>Akram reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.

It was made for Charles II by the royal goldsmith, Robert Vyner, in 1661 to replace a crown that was melted down in 1649. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The distinctive design consists of a solid gold frame set with rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, topazes, and tourmalines. The crown has a purple velvet cap with an ermine fur band.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crown&mdash;which was also worn by Queen Elizabeth during her 1953 coronation ceremony&mdash;is known for its remarkable weight. It is therefore only used at the exact moment of coronation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the months leading up to Charles&rsquo; big day, the crown was removed from its home with the other crown jewels in the Tower of London, and subject to modifications.
