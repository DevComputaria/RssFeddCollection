One of the highest profile alterations has been extension of the “Twitter verified” program. Previously reserved for celebrities and high profile individuals. Now anyone can pay a monthly subscription to become verified – and to display a Twitter verified blue ‘tick’ on their profile picture.</p>\n<p>But as new functionality is added, some is being taken away. One of the most important is the removal of SMS login verification for anyone except paying subscribers. Previously Twitter users could choose to protect their account with SMS two-factor authentication (2FA) which required a 6-digit code alongside their regular account password. This code would be sent via SMS to the user’s mobile phone.</p>\n<h3><strong>Do I have to pay to protect my Twitter account?</strong></h3>\n<p>SMS 2FA is not bulletproof – hackers have managed to breach these systems several times in the past. Security experts are agreed however, that SMS 2FA is far safer than simply relying on a password to protect account – and most are surprised about Twitter’s decision to remove this relatively basic safeguard.</p>\n<p>So do you have to become Twitter verified if you want to secure your account with 2FA? Yes – if you want to stick with codes sent with SMS. However, there are other, even more secure ways to protect yourself – authenticator apps.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are authenticator apps?</strong></h3>\n<p>Authenticator apps work in a very similar way to 2FA SMS codes. But instead of receiving a text message, your authenticator app automatically generates a secure code that changes every 30 seconds – which is actually safer than traditional SMS codes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandasecurity.pandaav&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;track=190548\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Download Panda Mobile Security\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/02/Banner-Mobile-EN.png\" alt=\"Download Panda Mobile Security\" width=\"600\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you have 2FA set up on your Twitter account, you log in as normal. Then, when prompted, you open the authenticator app on your phone to generate a new 2FA code – and then enter that into the website when prompted.</p>\n<p>Both Microsoft and Google provide authenticator apps for iOS and Android – and both work with Twitter too. Other options include LastPass, Twilio Authy and 1Password. If you already have an authenticator app for another service, it will probably work with Twitter too.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do I set up my Twitter account to use an authenticator app?</strong></h3>\n<p>Setting up 2FA in Twitter is quite easily. Log into your account at Twitter.com, then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <strong>Settings and privacy</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Security and account access </strong>-&gt; <strong>Security</strong> -&gt; <strong>Two-factor authentication</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have turned on two-factor authentication, follow the instructions provided to complete set-up in your authenticator app. Once complete, you will be prompted for a 2FA code every time you log in – and you can find that code in your chosen authenticator app.</p>\n<h3><strong>Should you enable 2FA on your Twitter account?</strong></h3>\n<p>2FA is an important tool for preventing cybercriminals from stealing your account and online identity. Everyone should enable 2FA – otherwise your Twitter account is vulnerable to hackers. It only takes a few minutes and it could save you some serious problems in future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/privacy/twitter-2fa/\">How to secure your Twitter account with 2FA</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/privacy/twitter-2fa/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"US Federal agencies banned from using foreign spyware","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/federal-agencies-spyware/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/federal-agencies-spyware/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 06:15:37 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Security"},{"#cdata-section":"Spyware"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=29609"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"US Federal Agencies will stop using foreign spyware\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">The US government wants Federal Agencies to use only their self-developed tools.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/federal-agencies-spyware/\">US Federal agencies banned from using foreign spyware</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"US Federal Agencies will stop using foreign spyware\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-foreign-spyware.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\">Earlier this week, The White House decided to ban federal agencies from using foreign <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/types-of-cybercrime/\">spyware</a>. President Biden signed an executive order that stops federal employees from utilizing the power of foreign commercial <strong>spyware</strong> such as the controversial <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/has-the-uk-government-been-hacked/\">Pegasus</a>, a spyware developed by Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group.</p>\n<p>White House confirmed that the radical decision is prompted by the finding of commercial spyware installed on the smartphones of <strong>fifty overseas government officials</strong>. The Biden Administration hopes the new ban will halt the always-increasing number of <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/social-media/critical-infrastructure-cyber-attacks/\">cyber-attacks on US citizens</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration also clarified that they do not wish to support companies whose services allow foreign states and authoritarian regimes to use this<strong> malicious software to target citizens without proper legal authorization</strong>, safeguards, and oversight. Such powerful surveillance tools have enabled foreign countries to perform political abuse and espionage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/security-promotion/?reg=uk&amp;lang=en&amp;campaign=dome1803&amp;coupon=20OFFMULTIP&amp;productID=PDE&amp;autobilling=no&amp;option=yearly\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Panda Ransomware Essential\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/02/Banner-Ransomware-EN.png\" alt=\"Download Panda Essential\" width=\"600\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n<p>The ban does not apply to locally developed cyber tools, so intelligence agencies like the <strong>CIA and the NSA can continue using their self-developed tools</strong>. DEA, which has been utilizing foreign-developed spyware tools for years, hopefully already has a US-grown replacement as they will no longer be able to suer foreign help. Many private companies in the cyber security sector in foreign countries such as Russia, Israel, China, and Singapore won’t be able to do business with the US government anymore.</p>\n<p>T<strong>he US government hopes its allies worldwide will follow</strong> the example and stop using spyware tools. Companies like the Israeli <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-can-pursue-malware-lawsuit-against-israels-nso-group-us-appeals-court-2021-11-08/\">NSO Group are facing backlash</a> from governments and Big Tech. Facebook’s Meta made the headlines by suing the spyware provider for selling tools that hack into their services. This does not come as a surprise as the spyware is often so powerful that <strong>it can copy any infected smartphone or tablet content entirely</strong> without the user needing to click on a link.</p>\n<p>While the ban does not surprise Russian and Chinese spyware developers, the Israeli NSO Group provides its solution to many US allies and European governments. The country of origin has always been considered the least risky provider of such services. The commercial spyware company has been claiming that it only sells its services to governments which are supposed to be used for counter-terrorism and anti-crime purposes, but this has not always been the case.</p>\n<p>Governments go after child sex abusers and terrorists but often misuse the tools by <strong>spying on political activists, journalists, and businesspeople</strong>. The company’s CEO, Yaron Shohat, made it to Washington earlier this year in an offer to prevent this from happening. Still, his trip was unsuccessful, as the White House has officially stopped using such services for government use.</p>\n<p>Consider using <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/\">top-quality antivirus software with VPN</a> if privacy and security matter to you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/federal-agencies-spyware/\">US Federal agencies banned from using foreign spyware</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/federal-agencies-spyware/feed/","slash:comments":"0"},{"title":"AI terms you need to know","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/ai-terms/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/ai-terms/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 10:38:02 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Mobile News"},{"#cdata-section":"Technology"},{"#cdata-section":"AI"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=29603"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">Artificial Intelligence is everywhere now, so it helps to understand these terms so you know what is happening.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/ai-terms/\">AI terms you need to know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pandasecurity-AI-terms.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\">Confused by Artificial Intelligence? You’re not alone. This short guide will help you understand some of the new technologies and what they mean for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h3>\n<p>Scientists have been trying to build <strong>computers capable of ‘thinking’ for themselves</strong> for many years – and we are finally reaching a point where these systems are capable of closely mimicking human behaviour. Artificial Intelligence is the technology that powers these systems, performing human-like activities, but they tend to be much faster.</p>\n<p>AI is used for image recognition, <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/british-health-ai/\">medical diagnostics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/police-ai-abuse/\">crime detection</a> and a whole host of other activities. Computers are very good at detecting and analysing patterns, and completing tasks automatically based on what they find.</p>\n<h3><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong></h3>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence systems don’t just happen – first <strong>they need to be ‘trained’</strong>. During machine learning, the AI is fed with data to help improve its pattern detection capabilities. So an AI designed to detect cancer will first be trained with diagnostic images that show cancerous <em>and </em> healthy cells, allowing the program to learn the difference between the two.</p>\n<p>All AI systems undergo the machine learning process to refine and improve accuracy – and to make them more useful in real life. You can learn more about machine learning <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/what-is-machine-learning/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://repository.pandasoftware.com/Panda/FREEAV/191254/PANDAFREEAV.exe\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Download Free Antivirus \" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/02/pandasecurity-free-antivirus-bullets-download.jpg\" alt=\"Download Panda Free Antivirus\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Generative AI </strong></h3>\n<p>The latest generation of AI – Generative AI – takes computing to a new level. More than simply spotting and analysing patterns, <strong>Generative AI is capable of <em>creating</em> new content</strong> based on what it has learned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/chatgpt-risks-associated/\">ChatGPT</a>, the smart chatbot which has taken the world by storm is an example of Generative AI. After being trained on millions of articles and datasets, ChatGPT can write its own text. As well as answering basic questions, the system can automatically write its own articles, computer code, letters, poems and songs – you just tell it what to do. And the <a href=\"https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2\">DALL-E tool</a> can do the same with images.</p>\n<h3><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong></h3>\n<p>Have you ever listened to a recording of a conversation and noticed that people don’t talk in properly ordered sentences. And that a lot of what they mean is conveyed in <em>how</em> they say the words, not the actual words themselves? These nuances are perfectly natural to humans – but very difficult for computers to understand.</p>\n<p>Natural Language Processing is an AI specialism that <strong>allows computers to better understand natural speech</strong> – the way that humans really talk. NLP technology is used by personal digital assistants like Siri, <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/what-is-alexa-and-how-does-she-work/\">Alexa</a> and Google Now, to understand what we are actually saying to them.</p>\n<h3><strong>AI Everywhere</strong></h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has become an extremely important technology because it allows us all to do more, more effectively. Many of the apps we use on our smartphones already use AI in some way for instance. AI will also allow organizations to provide personalized products and services that better meet our needs – like <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/\">Panda Dome</a>.</p>\n<p>Our flagship antimalware product uses artificial intelligence to detect and block suspicious computer activity that may indicate the presence of a virus <em>before</em> it can cause damage to your computer.

To guarantee your information is safe from prying eyes, you need Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP is an encryption system that scrambles your data, making it unreadable to anyone who doesn’t have the means of decoding it. By coordinating and sharing virtual keys, email senders and receivers can ensure their information stays private and secure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article we will detail the basics of PGP encryption: what it is, ways you can use it and if this technology is right for you.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Is PGP Encryption?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP is an encryption system that’s used to safely send sensitive or private information. First developed in </span><a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/cryptography/pgp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1991</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this technology has become one of the most popular encryption methods on the market due to its security and accessibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption is most commonly used for sending and receiving confidential emails. Cybercriminals can easily intercept messages and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/brute-force-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">access email accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and PGP ensures that the user’s information remains secure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an age where cyber threats lurk around every virtual corner, this type of encryption is an essential tool for anyone who wants guaranteed privacy in their digital communications.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How Does PGP Encryption Work?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption works by scrambling, or encrypting, a message in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone who doesn’t have a way to decode it. In order to fully understand PGP encryption, we will look at it from a technical perspective and provide a practical analogy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a technical level, PGP encryption </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/2023-data-privacy-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protects data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by using a combination of public keys, private keys and session keys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a user wants to send a private email or message, they’ll encrypt it using the receiver’s public key — an encryption key that’s known to everyone. Once the receiver gets the email, they’ll decrypt it using their private key — an encryption key that is only known by one user. This both ensures the message gets to where it needs to go, and that the recipient is the only one who can decrypt the message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the highest technological level, PGP encryption works in a three-step process:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Step 1: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP generates an extremely complex single-use random session key that cannot be guessed.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Step 2: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This session key is encrypted using the recipient’s public key. This public key is associated with the individual, and they can share it with anyone they wish to receive messages from.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Step 3: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sender passes along their session key, and the recipient can use their private key to decrypt and read the message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we’ve walked through the technical aspects of PGP, let’s look at an analogy to reinforce the concept:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael wants to send Beth a private message.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, Beth sends Michael an open box (her public key) as well as an open padlock (that only she has the key for).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael puts the message in the box, closes it and locks it with the padlock. Now that the padlock has been closed, no one but Beth (the owner of the private key) can open it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael sends the box to Beth, who opens it with her private key.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, with PGP encryption, Michael won’t have to worry about the box getting lost or stolen in transit because only Beth has the means to open the lock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, that’s what makes PGP encryption so secure — and also why it’s critical you don’t lose or share your private key if you’re sending encrypted files regularly.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29569\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process.png\" alt=\"The PGP encryption process in three steps.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1597\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process.png 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process-300x333.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process-866x960.png 866w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process-530x588.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/pgp-encryption-process-1385x1536.png 1385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<h2><b>How to Use PGP Encryption</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use PGP encryption anywhere you need an assurance of technological privacy. That said, the three most popular ways of using it are email and file encryption and digital signature verification.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Encrypting Emails</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email messaging has become one of the most common ways of exchanging information, but this communication method comes with risks. Both email accounts and the messages themselves can easily be </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/avoid-getting-hacked-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intercepted by cybercriminals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other unauthorized individuals, leading to potential data leaks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption solves this problem by engaging in the secure information exchange process we outlined above. Encrypting emails is the most common reason people use PGP encryption.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Encrypting Files</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the complexity of the PGP algorithm that makes it virtually unbreakable, this encryption method is also useful for securing personal files.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals can use PGP to encrypt files on their computer, flash drive, external hard drive or other storage devices. Paired with threat detection and response tools, this is a very secure way of keeping your personal information private.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Digital Signature Verification</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through PGP, individuals can also ensure the authenticity of electronic documents by verifying the identity of the sender and that the information in the message has not been tampered with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These digital signatures work by generating and encrypting a hash of the message, or a fixed block of data, when it is sent. The recipient of the message can access this data through the use of public and private keys, and they will be able to see if the message has been altered or otherwise manipulated.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29570\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/uses-of-pgp-encryption.png\" alt=\"The uses of PGP encryption include file and email encryption and data verification.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"911\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/uses-of-pgp-encryption.png 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/uses-of-pgp-encryption-300x190.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/uses-of-pgp-encryption-1280x810.png 1280w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2023/03/uses-of-pgp-encryption-530x335.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<h2><b>Is PGP Encryption Right for You?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption is a powerful tool, but is it right for you? Below, we will highlight the pros and cons of this technology.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Pros of PGP Encryption</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption is a popular method to keep information secure — and for good reason. A few of the top benefits of this technology include:</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Unbreakable algorithm: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP’s algorithm is virtually unbreakable, meaning your communications, files and other information is guaranteed to be safe from unauthorized users. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Enhanced security: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistently using PGP in communications will </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/cloud-cleaner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enhance cloud security</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, leading to a more secure online experience for individuals and businesses. </span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inexpensive: </b>PGP software is affordable, with a multitude of cheap yet effective options on the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Cons of PGP Encryption</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this technology is extremely effective, there are still a few downsides users should be aware of. A few of the cons of PGP encryption include:</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Complex: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption is a complicated software that can be difficult and time-consuming to learn.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Requires training: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To guarantee security, all users must safeguard their private keys. If an individual misplaces or accidentally gives away this information, there is real potential for security breaches and exposed information. </span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Can’t be anonymous: </b>All senders and recipients of information sent with PGP can be traced, meaning there is no ability for anonymity with this encryption method.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>How to Set Up PGP Encryption</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you’re an expert on PGP, you may have decided to use the technology in your communications going forward. Luckily, setting up and using PGP is an easy process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to select a PGP provider. There are plenty on the market — both free and paid options — that are compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and more. </span><a href=\"https://www.openpgp.org/#:~:text=OpenPGP%20is%20the%20most%20widely,software%2C%20created%20by%20Phil%20Zimmermann.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenPGP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.gpg4win.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gpg4win</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are two free options with good reviews.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve downloaded the software, you will generate your public and private keys directly from the platform. From there, your email client will have a new option to easily encrypt the email message — and with that, you’ll be communicating securely with PGP.</span></p>\n<h2><b>PGP Encryption FAQ</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we will wrap up with a few frequently asked questions about PGP encryption.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Is PGP Encryption Still Used?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, PGP encryption is still used today. In fact, it is one of the most popular security methods when sending sensitive information over email.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Can PGP Encryption Be Cracked?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, PGP encryption is an extremely complex algorithm that cannot be cracked.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Is PGP Better Than AES?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP is just as effective as AES, and which one you choose depends on your preferences. The main difference is that AES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt, while PGP uses two different keys.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Panda Security Can Help With Online Privacy</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PGP encryption is a powerful tool you can use to protect emails, personal files and other sensitive information. That said, online privacy doesn’t start and end with PGP — to achieve comprehensive security, you need to make sure your devices and networks are safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Panda Security, we have a variety of tools such as </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">password managers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/free-antivirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antivirus tools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/dark-web-scanner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dark web scanners</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ensure you stay safe no matter where you virtually visit.

This means that SMBs are a true economic powerhouse in the States. Although many of these companies believe that they are <a href=\"https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-cyber-security-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">too small to be attacked by cybercriminals</a>, almost <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/05/2019-small-business-cyber-attack-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">half of all cyberattacks</a> in the world target this kind of business.</p>\n<h2><strong>SMBs and ransomware</strong></h2>\n<p>According to a recent study, <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/tips/tips-smbs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SMBs</a> still have a lot of work to do when it comes to protecting against ransomware. To reach this conclusion, Infrascale interviewed over 500 C-level executives in SMBs. The results shed some light on the attitudes of this business segment towards ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>The most striking statistic is the fact that <strong>almost half (46%) of the SMBs surveyed have experienced a ransomware attack</strong>. However, the kind of SMB has an effect on this number. Among the SMBs in the B2B sector, 55% have fallen victim to a ransomware attack, while in the B2C sector, it falls to 36%.</p>\n<p>Whether the SMB is B2B or B2C also has an effect on how prepared the company is to deal with ransomware. While in general, 83% of SMBs feel prepared for a ransomware attack, in the B2B sector, the figure is 87%, while in B2C, it is just 77%. For the 17% of SMBs that do not feel prepared for ransomware, the principal obstacles are time and resources.</p>\n<p>Thirty-two percent of SMBs say <strong>that they do not have enough time</strong> to research ransomware mitigation strategies. The same percentage said that their IT teams were so stretched that they <strong>do not have enough resources to deal with the ransomware threat</strong>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Paying the ransom offers no guarantees</strong></h2>\n<p>Being unprepared for a ransomware attack can turn out to be very expensive for an SMB, especially if it decides to pay the ransom. Among the SMBs that have suffered a ransomware attack in the B2B sector, 78% paid the ransom demanded by the cyberattacker; in the B2C sector, 63% of organizations too the same decision.</p>\n<p>This is not a cheap option: 43% of SMBs that have paid a ransom paid between $10,000 and $50,000. Thirteen percent of those that chose to pay the ransom were forced to pay over $100,000.</p>\n<p>Among the SMBs that haven’t paid a ransom, 26% would consider paying one to get their data back. Sixty percent of organizations say that they would choose this option to recover their files quickly, while 53% say they would pay to avoid the reputational damage related to data protection and data recovery efforts.</p>\n<p>However, even if the company chooses to pay up (an option that Panda and other experts strongly advise against), there is no guarantee that the organization will recover its data: <strong>17% of companies that have paid a ransom say that they only recovered part of the data lost in the attack.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How to avoid ransomware in SMBs</strong></h2>\n<p>Even though 72% of SMBs have a plan to mitigate ransomware attacks, it is not enough. Those with no plan are exposing their data to unnecessary risk, as well as endangering their clients and partners. This is why it is so important that measures be taken to stop ransomware affecting SMBs.</p>\n<p>The first step is to properly protect email, which is the attack vector for <a href=\"https://blog.knowbe4.com/bid/252429/91-of-cyberattacks-begin-with-spear-phishing-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">91% of all cyberattacks</a>. To stop a phishing email from leading to a ransomware attack, never open links or attachments from unknown senders.</p>\n<p>Another point of entry that needs to be monitored are RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections. Ever since a large percentage of the workforce has been working from home, these connections have become vital. However, they are also a popular target for cyberattackers: every day there are <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/brute-force-rdp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a million brute force attacks</a> against this protocol. RDP connections are the first step in <a href=\"https://duo.com/decipher/attackers-combine-attacks-against-rdp-with-ransomware#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20quarter%20of,the%20target%20machines%2C%20Coveware%20said.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">63% of ransomware attacks</a>.</p>\n<p>To protect against these kinds of incidents, it is also vital to have an advanced cybersecurity solution. <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/business/adaptive-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panda Adaptive Defense</a> stops any unknown process until it can determine whether or not it is malicious. What’s more, it also monitors all endpoint activity, and thus knows exactly what is happening on the system at all times. This way, no advanced cyberattack targeting companies, even ransomware, can run on protected computers.</p>\n<p>Using the right tools for each company is a must to keep computers safe.

Use Secure Solutions</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to payments, data transfers, and other sensitive operations, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s important to maintain security and data integrity.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Using adequate encryption methods, reliable certificates and secure payment platforms is essential. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, small businesses should incorporate multi-factor authentication into their system protocols, and refrain from using personal mobile devices as secondary security sources.</span></p>\n<h2><b>9. Educate Your Workforce</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are an SMB’s first line of defense in the face of a cyberattack, so they need to know the possible dangers and access points a hacker may try to break through. Employee </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/tips/cybersecurity-tips-to-train-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">training and education</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should focus on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">security practices, working protocols, prohibited actions, and how </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to solve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problems stemming from cyber activity.</span></p>\n<h2><b>10. Understand Password Security</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/how-to-create-strong-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong passwords</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can make or break the security of any organization, including small businesses of all types. Create passwords at least eight characters long</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with alphanumeric characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to increase their strength. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also advisable to change them from time to time, never use the same password for more than a year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and utilize a </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/dome-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">password manager</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for added security.</span></p>\n<h2><b>11. Create Backups</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are solutions and companies dedicated exclusively to safeguarding companies’ data, the value of backups should never be underestimated. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining consistent backups of all company data can protect SMBs from the danger of some cyberattacks and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mobile-news/avoid-ransomware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prevent ransomware</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> attacks.</span></p>\n<h2><b>12. </b><b>Vet Third-Party Partners</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your SMB partners with a third party, vet them and their employees before granting them access to your systems. Zero trust security can provide additional protection surrounding your infrastructure systems, but background checks are encouraged before granting network access.</span></p>\n<h2><b>13. </b><b>Guard Physical Hardware</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While hackers are well-known for attacking devices from a distance, they may choose to access devices physically if they have the chance. Keep devices away from unauthorized individuals, and enable remote wiping access so you can protect your system’s security on lost or stolen devices. Additionally, electronic devices should be wiped and </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/recycling-electronics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recycled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of thrown away during times of device transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These cybersecurity tips for small businesses are not meant to be fail-safes.

The last thing travelers want to worry about is how to </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/find-wifi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">find Wi-Fi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when traveling while they’re sitting on the beach, trekking through the mountains or eating a new culinary dish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking to </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/mobile-news/how-to-surf-safely-when-on-holiday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surf the internet safely while on holiday</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or simply need Wi-Fi to get to your destination, our seven options below can help you get internet for travel.</span></p>\n<h2><b>1. Mobile Service Providers</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before jetting, contact your mobile carrier to see what — if any — type of data plans they may offer for travelers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most major cellular carriers in the U.S. have agreements with foreign telecom companies, so getting an international plan added to your account might </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help you avoid other costly options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some service providers also have hotspot options for smart devices, which can be used to connect additional devices to Wi-Fi when traveling. You can discuss this option with your carrier when inquiring about international plans.</span></p>\n<h2><b>2. Mobile Hotspots</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile hotspots are physical, standalone devices that can create local internet hotspots for users. These devices can also be used by RV travelers for better internet reception.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways you can get a mobile hotspot:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can </span><b>rent </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a mobile hotspot where prices depend on the amount of data you want, where you are traveling and how long you will be gone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can </span><b>buy </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a mobile hotspot where prices depend on the make, model and amount of data you want.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile hotspots are a great option for family vacations because they allow users to connect multiple devices at once. However, they can be expensive and they only work when devices are within range.</span></p>\n<h2><b>3. Local SIM Cards</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a more cost-effective solution, consider buying a local SIM card for the places you are traveling to. Usually, you will need to buy this when you arrive at your destination but it’s sometimes possible to buy SIM cards before you depart. Check your destination’s local regulations about SIM card purchases before pursuing this option.</span></p>\n<h2><b>4. Travel SIMs</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel SIMs — or roaming SIMs — are specifically designed to provide users with internet for travel. These SIM cards don’t need to be switched in and out of a device while traveling because they can operate on more than one network. This option can be more expensive than purchasing a local SIM card, but it can also be a great solution for users with outrageous international plan prices.</span></p>\n<h2><b>5. Satellite Internet</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need to get online while traveling by RV, boat or another large transport device, satellite internet is a potential internet solution. While satellite receivers need to be mounted to an object, need a clear view of the sky, and are often more expensive than other service options, they can provide internet for travel when mobile hotspots can’t. </span></p>\n<h2><b>6. Roaming Data</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the easiest ways to get internet for travel is to use roaming data offered by a cell service provider. This can be costly — especially if you’re traveling for extended periods — but it’s usually instant and fairly reliable. </span></p>\n<h2><b>7. USB Dongles</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/countries-with-the-fastest-internet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working abroad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and need to connect to the internet, a USB dongle is a safe option. While these devices sometimes have limited speed and stability, they offer protected internet access for laptops and other desktop devices. Additionally, dongles need compatible SIM cards, so they aren’t always the most practical option.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-29577\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling.png\" alt=\"Seven ways to get Wi-Fi when traveling, including mobile hotspots and travel SIMs\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1112\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling.png 1440w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling-300x232.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling-1243x960.png 1243w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling-530x409.png 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2021/08/wifi-when-traveling-225x175.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<h2><b>Other Tips and Tricks For Getting Internet for Travel </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding or carrying Wi-Fi when traveling comes with a few precautions. To keep your information safe when you’re away from home, follow these tips and tricks for traveling internet.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Avoid Public Wi-Fi </b><b>Networks</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might feel tempted to join public Wi-Fi hotspots while away, but doing so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can put you and your devices at risk because many </span><b>public Wi-Fi networks are poorly managed.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, your traffic might be monitored by the network administrator or a hacker who has cracked the network.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Use a VPN</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you must connect to a public network, only do so if you have downloaded a reliable </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/vpn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VPN</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. VPNs are designed to keep your online browsing secure and private, protecting your personal information and conversations.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Be Aware of Juice Jacking</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charging stations at airports and coffee shops may be compromised by malicious software. Make sure you have proper </span><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/free-antivirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antivirus software</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or bring your own AC adapter to charge your devices. If you are ever asked to ‘trust’ a computer when charging your device on a public USB station, always hit ‘no’ and decline access.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Bring Backups</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backups — for both physical and digital items — are highly recommended when traveling. Keep important documents backed up to a secondary device or location, and pack spare charging cables and power banks in your luggage. If your devices are compromised or run out of battery, backups will keep you prepared.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Prepare Maps and Documents</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you may do everything you can to keep yourself connected to Wi-Fi when traveling, you may still be disconnected at some point. Prepare by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pre-downloading maps of the area you are planning to visit </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and securing important documents behind encryptions and firewalls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traveling should be a time to relax or discover new places.

But how would you feel if you knew your boss might potentially be able to see what you are doing on your work computer?</p>\n<h3>Do you have any privacy at work?</h3>\n<p>Employees have always been watched at work, but while it was once a factory foreman or supervisor, now you can be viewed remotely using CCTV monitoring or keycard tracking when you open various doors.<br />\nThere are quite a few ways that employers could be digitally monitoring you and your computer usage, but let’s be clear any monitoring should be outlined in a company policy document. That being said here are lots of ways your employer could be monitoring your computer usage. A few of those are listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Your PC / laptop web activity.</b> All outgoing network traffic flows through a router or firewall to enable network access to off-site websites, but these tools also would allow employers to report on employee internet usage easily. Clearing your browser history and clearing your cache won’t help too much here either.</li>\n<li><b>Your phone</b>. Even if you are using your phone, if you are connected to your employer’s network they can still trace the sites you visit through the firewall/router.</li>\n<li><b>The files you access</b>. If you are working from a server, then your employer can see every file you ever accessed or saved and when!</li>\n<li><b>Your emails.</b> Many companies archive all emails indefinitely, often simply to provide protection in the event of IP disputes with other organizations. However, these archives can also be accessed if your employer has reason to do so.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Is there anything you can do?</h3>\n<p>Thankfully, there is! While you can’t stop your employer tracking what happens on their email and file servers, you can maintain privacy over the websites you visit by using a VPN – or <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/technology/difference-vpn-vs-proxy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual proxy network</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/solutions/vpn/\">High-quality VPN software solutions</a> allow you to maintain your privacy by encrypting your data and internet requests before they ever hit the wireless network. The technology works the same if you are at work, at home or using a wireless hotspot at the mall. The data is sent to the VPN server which decrypts the requests before sending them on to the online destination.</p>\n<p>The information is then sent back through the same process. Make sure your VPN uses the most secure VPN protocol on the market to ensure the only person that can see your data is you.<br />\nIf you want to take control of how much of your online activity your employer can see, then your first port of call really <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/solutions/vpn/\">should be to start using VPN</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://acs.pandasoftware.com/Panda/FREEAV/190705/PANDAVPN.exe\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Download Panda FREE VPN\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2018/05/pandasecurity-download-vpn-eng.jpg\" alt=\"Download Panda FREE VPN\" width=\"560\" height=\"310\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/is-your-boss-watching-you/\">The internet is watching you, could your boss be too?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/is-your-boss-watching-you/feed/","slash:comments":"1"},{"title":"Three decades of cybersecurity vulnerabilities","link":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/three-decades-vulnerabilities/","comments":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/three-decades-vulnerabilities/#respond","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"},"pubDate":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:30:09 +0000","category":[{"#cdata-section":"Business"},{"#cdata-section":"Panda Security"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/?p=26440"},"description":{"#cdata-section":"<p><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Three decades of cybersecurity vulnerabilities\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-1100x825.jpg 1100w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"post-excerpt\">Here, we're taking a look at some of the most important vulnerabilities of the last 30 years, and the incidents they have caused.</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/three-decades-vulnerabilities/\">Three decades of cybersecurity vulnerabilities</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"content:encoded":{"#cdata-section":"<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-feed size-feed wp-post-image\" alt=\"Three decades of cybersecurity vulnerabilities\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-1100x825.jpg 1100w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner-530x398.jpg 530w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/2005-30-a-vulner.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p class=\"dropcap dropcap-simple\">Cybercrime trends are always changing. In the 30 years since Panda Security was founded, we&#8217;ve seen everything from computer viruses delivered from floppy disks, malicious attachments, Trojans and ransomware, to live hacking and fileless threats. In fact, paradoxically, evolution and change could be seen as the only constants in cybercrime. However, there is one other element that many of the most notorious cyberincindents of the last 30 years have had in common: vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2><strong>Vulnerabilities are a cybercriminal&#8217;s best friend</strong></h2>\n<p>Vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications are one of the most popular points of entry for cybercrime. In fact, according to one study, by the end of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/focus-on-the-biggest-security-threats-not-the-most-publicized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">99% of successfully exploited vulnerabilities will be known before the incident</a>. Here, we&#8217;re taking a look at some of the most important vulnerabilities of the last 30 years, and the incidents they have caused.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-26449\" src=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/Infog-Vul-30A_EN-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"586\" srcset=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/Infog-Vul-30A_EN-1.png 843w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/Infog-Vul-30A_EN-1-300x343.png 300w, https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/src/uploads/2020/05/Infog-Vul-30A_EN-1-530x607.png 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morris Worm (1988). </strong>To see one of the first examples of a computer virus that exploited known vulnerabilities, we have to go back to 1988, two years before the World Wide Web was invented. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Morris Worm</a> was one of the first computer worms to spread via the Internet. It exploited known vulnerabilities in Unix Sendmail, rsh/rexec, as well as weak passwords. While the creator&#8217;s intention wasn&#8217;t to cause any damage, rather to highlight security weaknesses, it caused between $100,000 and $10,000,000 in damages.</li>\n<li><strong>SQL Slammer (2003). </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Slammer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SQL Slammer</a> is another worm that, in 2003, infected around 75,000 machines in just ten minutes. It caused denial of service for several Internet providers, and dramatically slowed down Internet traffic. In order to spread so quickly<em>,</em> SQL Slammer exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server. Six months before the incident, Microsoft had released a patch to fix this bug.</li>\n<li><strong>Zotob (2005). </strong>This worm, which infected systems running various Microsoft operating systems including Windows 2000, exploited various vulnerabilities, including the vulnerability MS05-039 in Plug &amp; Play services. It forced infected machines to restart continuously; each time the computer restart, a new copy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zotob\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zotob</a> was created. Although it didn&#8217;t affect a large number of computers, it had a major impact on its victims: It is estimated that affected companies spent an average of $97,000 on cleaning the malware from their systems and needed around 80 hours to disinfect their systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Conficker (2008). </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conficker</a> is a worm that was first detected in November 2008. It exploited several vulnerabilities, including one in a network service found in several versions of Windows such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 2000. As Conficker spread, it used the infected computers to create a botnet. It is estimated to have infected between 9 and 15 million computers. Despite how how far it spread, Conficker did not cause extensive damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Stuxnet (2010). </strong>In June 2010, a cyberattack called Stuxnet managed to destroy the centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear power plant. <a href=\"https://www.cytomic.ai/alerts/stuxnet-large-attack-cyberwar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Although Stuxnet is believed to have got onto the power plant&#8217;s systems via a pen drive</a>, to spread, it used four zero-day vulnerabilities, as well as the same vulnerabilities that Conficker used.</li>\n<li><strong>EternalBlue (2017). </strong>EtenernalBlue is the name of a vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This vulnerability gained notoriety in 2017 when it was exploited to carry out the global <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/es/mediacenter/noticias/hacker-acusado-wannacry-corea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WannaCry ransomware attacks</a>. These attacks affected computers in over 150 countries and caused an estimates $4 billion dollars in damages all around the world. This vulnerability was also exploited in the NotPetya ransomware attacks. A patch was available for this vulnerability one month before WannaCry hit.</li>\n<li><strong>BlueKeep (2019).</strong> In May 2019, a vulnerability was discovered in Windows operating systems <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/news/bluekeep-windows-vulnerability-scan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called BlueKeep</a>, which affected up to one million devices. It existed in the Remote Desktop Protocol, and one moth after it was discovered, security firms began to <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/news/goldbrute-botnet-rdp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These vulnerabilities are just a few of the vulnerabilities that have had an impact over the years. However, every year, tens of thousands of new vulnerabilities are discovered that can pose a serious problem for the <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/tips/tips-smbs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cybersecurity of small</a>, medium, and large organizations. This is why Panda Security offers its clients specific solutions to fix vulnerabilities, as well as resources so that they can find out about the most important vulnerabilities. In Panda Security&#8217;s 30 years of experience, we&#8217;ve seen thousands of vulnerabilities and thousands of cyberincidents caused by them. Another constant throughout all of these years is that all of our clients have always been protected.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/three-decades-vulnerabilities/\">Three decades of cybersecurity vulnerabilities</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter\">Panda Security Mediacenter</a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":"https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/three-decades-vulnerabilities/feed/","slash:comments":"0"}]}}}
