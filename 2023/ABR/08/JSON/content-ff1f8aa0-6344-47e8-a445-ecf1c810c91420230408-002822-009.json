Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documents reportedly contain charts and details about weapons deliveries, battalion strengths and other sensitive information, the Times said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information in the documents is at least five weeks old, with the most recent dated March 1, the report said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the documents summarised the training schedules of 12 Ukraine combat brigades, and said nine of them were being trained by US and NATO forces, and needed 250 tanks and more than 350 mechanized vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documents-at least one of which carried a &#8220;top secret&#8221;

Since late March 2023 their advance had largely stalled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Russia has made further gains and has now highly likely advanced into the town centre, and has seized the west bank of the Bakhmutka River. Ukraine&#8217;s key 0506 supply route to the west of the town is likely severely threatened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Russian regular forces, likely including airborne troops, have probably reinforced the area, and Russia is again using artillery more effectively in the sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is realistic possibility that, locally, Wagner and Russian MoD commanders have paused their ongoing feud and improved co-operation.&#8221;</p>"},{"title":"I’m a hot female roofer and can lift as much as the blokes – I’m flooded with offers from men to join their companies","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21973326/hot-female-roofer-flooded-offers/","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 08:23:51 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Aliki Kraterou"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"jobs"},{"#cdata-section":"TikTok"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21973326 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p> A STUNNING female roofer who can lift as much as men says she is inundated with job offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Influencer Vilma Honkonen has showed off her skills on <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/\">TikTok</a> sharing clips where she lifts 25kgs without a sweat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21973605\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 369px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-302.png?strip=all&amp;w=359\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973605\" width=\"359\" height=\"573\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Tiktoker works as a roofer</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21973694\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 778px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384971.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973694\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok</figcredit></figure>She says she can lift as much as a man[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21973613\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 366px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-304.png?strip=all&amp;w=356\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973613\" width=\"356\" height=\"543\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vilma got into roofing after she was trained by her dad</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21973705\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 778px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384768.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973705\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok</figcredit></figure>Vilma also shares snaps of herself outside of work[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The pretty blond who is a former beautician, often shares insights of her job with her followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos show that her job as a roofer requires a lot of physical activity- with her lifting quite heavy weights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 25-year-old who says she changed profession thanks to her dad admits that she has &#8220;two different personalities,&#8221;

residences on a network of armoured trains &#8211; almost totally detached from the world outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life. He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum,&#8221; the defector told the <a href=\"https://dossier.center/fso/\">Dossier Centre</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a unique and rare first hand insight into the deeply twisted mindset of a world leader who has had near absolute power for more than 20 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is further paints the picture of Putin as an acutely strange individual who appears to be living in a nightmare of his own making, where very little is true and everyone is out to get him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad&#8217;s inner circle is small &#8211; with him having very few close confidantes, beyond figures like his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/\">mistress Alina Kabaeva</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21823223/putin-ally-medvedev-warns-nuclear-war-us-russia/\">stooge Dmitry Medvedev</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin, 70, is believed to be obsessed with his own death &#8211; both from possible illness or from the knife of assassins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the long-reported linchpins of Putin&#8217;s personality has been his deep-seated fear that he could be &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18910482/vladimir-putin-killed-gaddafi-russia/\">killed like Gaddafi</a>&#8221; &#8211; with the Libyan tyrant being overthrown and murdered in 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad is claimed to have obsessively watched mobile phone footage of him being pulled out of a storm drain before being manhandled by an angry crowd, sodomised with a bayonet, and shot dead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears to have been a turning point for Putin &#8211; fuelling the deep-seated paranoia of the man raised in the Soviet Union and the KGB.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov that Putin&#8217;s fear of death is so severe that he has replica offices dotted across Russia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad wants to make sure his enemies can never know his position &#8211; making sure they can never come for him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And subsequently, there are various unverified claims that during the war Putin has used body doubles to appear in certain locations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials have claimed Vlad is using three such men to carry out duties on his behalf &#8211; but no one knows for sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin himself has previously been forced to deny that he uses body doubles &#8211; but did claim he was once offered them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov explained there is a virtual &#8220;state-within-a-state&#8221; that looks after Putin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this inner bubble just further deepens his isolation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin&#8217;s fear of death apparently was worsened by the Covid pandemic &#8211; and the bodyguard says his lifestyle has altered significantly since 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad was once eager to be seen as the world&#8217;s number one strongman and to trot the world stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was famously pictured hunting, riding horses, playing with his dogs, swimming with dolphins, playing hockey, doing judo and various other macho stunts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet now, when he is seen &#8211; Vlad is normally sat behind a screen or keeps several dozen feet away from his colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21968830\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-136334127jpg-JS722740021.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640\" alt=\"Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin rides a horse during his vacation outside the town of Kyzyl in Southern Siberia on August 3, 2009.

You could have prevented it, but you didn&#8217;t&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>American psychologist Frederick Coolidge previously described Putin&#8217;s increased isolationism, health fears and paranoia as typical of tyrants &#8211; comparing him to Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[Autocrats] tend to have an excessive fear of death or infection,&#8221; he told the <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/covid-19-pandemic_putin-bismarck-autocrats-fear-germs/6191402.html\">Voice of America</a> in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They fear losing control, they fear losing everything and have a need to control everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And they are not always rational about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And meanwhile, it&#8217;s been reported that Putin has increasingly questioned how &#8220;loyal&#8221; his government is over the war in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian newspaper Vedomosti&nbsp;reported that week that some 33,000 Russian officials have been weeded out due to &#8220;opposition sentiments&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these cases were down to &#8220;offenses&#8221; involving social media since the start of the war last February. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hardline figures in Russia are also gaining prominence thanks to the war, such as Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin is understood to distrust his once close ally Prigozhin  &#8211; and may now be attempting to set them up to fail in Ukraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this storm of paranoia and infighting is on top of rumours Putin is batting several health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation is fuelled by his often <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/\">bloated look</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/\">twitching feet</a> &#8211; with long-running rumours he is suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s or even cancer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as with much information about Putin &#8211; most of this is down to rumours and speculation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And his increasing isolation is making these reports harder to verify. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov provided the world with some of the best insight yet into Vlad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our president has lost touch with the world,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has been living in an information cocoon for the past couple of years, spending most of his time in his residences, which the media very fittingly call bunkers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life. He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He only values his own life and the lives of his family and friends.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad hasn&#8217;t made the gains he or his commanders expected and Russia has found itself bogged down in a long, brutal war as humiliating defeats pile up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tyrant now seemingly has his future tied to his success or failure in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin foolishly believed his forces would be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators when he invaded last February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead, the initial attack ended in a disaster which saw his forces devastated and thrown back to Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyiv continues to call for Western support to help them defeat Putin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world is now awaiting to see if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21907573/ukraine-tanks-challenger-2-bloodiest-battle/\">Ukraine will mount its long

I’m the only one that has been telling the truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And, you know, you can’t shame me even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So I feel like if they don’t, it paints the picture that they know something about me that makes me you know, untrustworthy, or not reliable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think having them call me in and put me on the stand legitimises my story and who I am,&#8221; added Stormy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Stormy &#8211; who is a registered Republican but said she did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 &#8211; told Piers that she does not believe he should face jail for his alleged crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she explained that for other alleged crimes he is under investigation for &#8211; Trump could end up being sent to prison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump is currently also under investigation for mishandling government documents, over allegations of fraud, and for attempting to interfere with the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy told Piers: &#8220;I feel like the other things that he has done, if he is found guilty, absolutely.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;TELL THE TRUTH&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>She also urged Trump, who she claims got his bodyguard to ask for her phone number, to &#8220;tell the truth&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy added: &#8220;If you continue to do this you are setting a precedent where people think that they won&#8217;t be held accountable and I&#8217;m afraid there are gong to be a lot of people hurt.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She warned if Trump is found guilty of other crimes it could &#8220;open the door for other people to think they can get away with doing that and worse&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath of his bombshell court appearance, Trump raged the US is &#8220;going to hell&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 76-year-old is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination and will likely take on his nemesis Joe Biden in 2024</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His indictment is seen by many analysts as handing him the ticket &#8211; cauterising his hardline base who may have been turning towards rival Ron DeSantis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump is using his legal trouble as a way to rile up his diehard supporters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it remains to be seen how his arrest will play with key swing voters who were turned off by Trump in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy also revealed &#8220;one in ten&#8221; messages she receives are death threats and she wishes she&#8217;d never met Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;They [the messages] would always be from an account somebody created just to do that with no followers, hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s different, the tone is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And they are way more specific and graphic. They seem to be more serious in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not hiding &#8211; these people are using their phone numbers, and their actual emails and their actual Twitter accounts &#8211; which then makes it worse because they actually have followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They genuinely feel they are doing something right.&nbsp;It makes you become paranoid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964408\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

Mar-a-Lago[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>After returning home to his Mar-a-Lago resort from New York on Tuesday, Trump gave a venomous speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking out to &#8220;God Bless the USA&#8221;, Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case &#8211; calling him &#8220;the real criminal&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He accused Juan Merchan of being a &#8220;Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family&#8221; &#8211; and said the case against him was &#8220;an insult to our country&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The only crime I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump called for&nbsp;the &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; case to be &#8220;dropped immediately&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he suggested he lost the 2020 US election unfairly &#8220;because our country is going to hell&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump denies the claim by Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex in 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/\">Melania</a>&nbsp;&#8211; and four months after she gave birth to their son&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2183312/how-tall-barron-trump-height-age/\">Barron</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/\">former lawyer Michael Cohen</a>&nbsp;allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors argue this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he cannot allow &#8220;businesses to cover up criminal conduct&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The historic case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The indictment focused on Trump&#8217;s reimbursement checks to Cohen &#8211; with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em style=\"font-weight: bold\">You can watch the full interview on the Piers Morgan Uncensored</em>

town of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/web-stories/inside-the-wild-magaluf-of-the-slopes-ski-resort-swamped-with-brits-where-there-are-89p-beers-crazy-parties/\">Bankso</a>, in the south west, is already overrun with raucous Brits after earning a ­­reputation for cheap booze, parties and affordable ski trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three hundred miles east at Sunny Beach the scene is just as lively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Every year around 100,000 Brits cause bedlam at the hedonistic resort which has been the cheapest in Europe for the past five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tourists are drawn by 80p pints, bars that sell <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/mens-health-and-fitness/3189669/how-viagra-effects-penis-minute-by-minute/\">Viagra jellies</a>, and all-you-can-drink nights for just 30 euros (£26) — about the same cost as a hotel room. Revellers can be seen inhaling laughing gas from balloons on the street, as the over-inebriated vomit on pavements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resort is now the subject of new <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/e4/\">E4</a> docu-series Emergency On Sunny Beach, which over six hour-long episodes from Wednesday will follow local firefighters and medical centre staff trying to cope with the holidaymakers’ crazy antics.</p>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=39775&#038;game=polling\"></script>\n\n\n\n<h2>Laughing gas balloons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers will see two Edinburgh fun-seekers, caretaker Demi and student Holly, both 20, take advantage of a fairground slingshot ride which is free to women who go topless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demi’s face is covered in cuts and bruises and she has lost half her front tooth after a drunken fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holly tells the camera crew: “It’s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/blackpool/\">Blackpool</a> but abroad.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pointing at her face, Demi adds: “We’ve only done it to get f***ed up and this is what happens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Lesson learnt: Don’t give anyone a piggyback when you’re drunk, and don’t run when you’re doing it because you’ll have to pay a lot of money. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18796651/travel-insurance-mistakes-thousands-of-pounds/\">take out insurance</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both girls are seen sucking laughing gas from balloons and getting tattoos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demi gets the words “Smoke <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cannabis-legalisation/\">weed </a>every day” inked in Arabic across her thigh, while Holly gets a butterfly on her tricep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demi says: “I can’t speak Arabic but it’s started a few conversations by the pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If my family asks, then I’ll just say it says, ‘Live, laugh, love’.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The destination is so riotous that 40 cops are drafted in each summer from other parts of Bulgaria to try to keep a lid on things, while 130 lifeguards patrol the 5km-long beach. The fire service attend ten times as many blazes in summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Club Viking is the biggest venue in town and holds hook-up nights for singletons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owner Tsvetan Florov, 30, tells the TV documentary: “The young British lads are like wild animals. People try to have <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sex/\">sex </a>in the club. Someone’s going to be lucky — that’s why we also give away condoms so they can practise safe sex.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mason, 21, from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/essex/\">Essex</a>, on his first lads’ holiday away, has a supply of 20 condoms for ten days. He is seen on bar crawls, downing shots half-naked and licking booze off a Bulgarian girl’s breasts. He takes her back to his room but fails to get lucky when her pals burst in and take her home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21970843\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-supplied-807750018.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970843\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Channel 4</figcredit></figure>Dillan, 19, from Hampshire, blew a grand in a strip club on his first night and he and pal Ollie say they have &#8216;no ambitions other than to come home in one piece&#8217;[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21970785\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-807805518.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970785\" width=\"960\" height=\"535\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Channel 4</figcredit></figure>Tourists are drawn by 80P pints, bars that sell Viagra jellies, and all-you-can-drink nights for just 30 euros (£26) — about the same cost as a hotel room[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21970841\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-807805510.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970841\" width=\"960\" height=\"532\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Channel 4</figcredit></figure>The Balkan town of Bankso, in the southwest, is already overrun with raucous Brits after earning a repu-tation for cheap booze, parties and affordable ski trips[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>He admits: “I’m a bit optimistic on the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18478684/vegetable-themed-condoms-slash-sti-rates/\">condoms</a> but you never know . . . I want to shag a milf and shag a load of foreign birds because I love foreign birds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m 21, a young buck, I’ve got a lot of goals. I’m going to make Sunny Beach my oyster.” Identical twins Oscar and Harvey, 20, from Southampton, are caught on camera peeing on the balcony of their hotel room, flashing their bums in a nightclub, inhaling laughing gas and electrocuting each other with what looks like a stun gun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oscar says: “I expect Mum to call me every hour just to make sure I’m still alive — 500 messages a day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess and Carmel, care workers from Essex, enjoy a party on a booze-cruise boat trip from Sunny Beach, and trying to hook up with strangers in the street. Carmel, who accident-ally flashes her boob during a pole dance, says: “What happens in ­Bulgaria stays in Bulgaria.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dillan, 19, from Hampshire, blew a grand in a strip club on his first night and he and pal Ollie say they have “no ambitions other than to come home in one piece”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ollie, also 19, has lost his tooth after he asked Dillan to throw a shot glass at his mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another holidaymaker, Ruby, 18, of Herts, says: “I don’t think you can come to Sunny Beach with a boyfriend. If you do, you’re going home without one.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the young who are having a ball, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colin, 67, wastes six hours of police time trying to find his room while drunk. He is finally reunited with his wife — who is fast asleep and had no idea he was missing — after police call the travel operator and find he is staying just across the street from their station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But holiday reps have quite the reputation, too. Ex-trucker Harry, 29, a tour guide for five years, tells the camera: “You need to try the Viagra jellies — I had the mango one. It did f***ing work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow rep Liam, 23, an ex-roofer, from Blackpool, says the resort has “helped me find myself a lot” but admits he spent his first season, in 2019, drunk for 12 weeks straight.</p>\n\n\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tp-graphic-bulgaria-map-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21971810\" width=\"960\" height=\"739\" />\n\n\n\n<p>His pal Jacob, 22, also a rep and from Blackpool, says: “Sunny Beach is like paradise. Girls everywhere, bar crawls, boat parties, it’s sick!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sunny Beach is the best place to go for a party — boat parties, bar crawls, you’ll make memories and mates for life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the main, the locals are happy for Brits to splash the cash at Sunny Beach. Taxi drivers love the trade while restaurants sell a three-course meal with wine for £20. You can sober up on coffee for 60p. But local cop Desislava Goranova warns it is not all fun in the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;She tells TV viewers: “Sunny Beach is a resort of two extremes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You have beautiful nature and a stunning beach, but also places with criminals, drunk people, people on drugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“During the day the resort is so colourful — people having fun and enjoying the beach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At night the central part of the resort goes through a change, the clubs open, it’s full of people with loose morals, a lot of drugs and booze. In my view the usual British tourist looks like this — fair skin, a bit chubby and wearing as little clothing as possible, always very loud and covered in tattoos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Compared to other nationalities the British tourists are always very loud and jolly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They love having lively conversations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her colleague Emil Tonchev adds: “The British people cause the most problems because they can’t drink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Bulgarians have brandy, the Brits drink beer. We get sober by drinking beer. People come on holiday and lose their senses.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But taxi driver Ilea says the resort would be nothing without the tourists. He tells viewers: “Tourists are crazy at night now compared to years ago, especially the young people.

designed by Russia &#8211; matches the one at Putin&#8217;s other residences and boltholes around Moscow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, Pantsir missile systems were also spotted near two of Putin&#8217;s residences in the city of&nbsp;Valday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Novo-Ogaryovo&nbsp;estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Air defence systems have also been put on the rooftops of several buildings in Moscow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guy McCardle, managing editor of&nbsp;Special Operations Forces Report, told&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"Newsweek (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/air-defenses-being-installed-near-putins-sochi-home-oppositionists-claim-1792308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Newsweek</a>: &#8220;There&#8217;s no way he does not have both defensive and offensive capabilities near his many residences or anywhere he will be spending a substantial period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They are there to protect him and his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a part of a coordinated air defence system, I think these would be extremely effective at knocking drones, missiles, helicopters and even fighter jets out of the sky.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Russian media outlet Meduza, Putin officially has three residences &#8211; not including the Kremlin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple properties have been linked to the Russian leader in recent years &#8211; and the palaces are often located in remote locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports, Putin is said to be living with his gymnast girlfriend and their kids in a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13792316/putins-secret-1billion-palace/\">luxurious mansion near Moscow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13,000 square feet property on Lake Valdai, built entirely from wood in the style of a Russian dacha, is reportedly home Kabaeva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian leader is believed to have bought her a&nbsp;property&nbsp;empire valued at £100million using a slush fund in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/cyprus/\">Cyprus</a>, Russian investigative site The Project claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures of the mansion, leaked by a construction executive, reveal its luxurious interiors, which are said to have been inspired by Putin’s love for his hometown of St Petersburg and its eighteenth-century Hermitage Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports about the existence of the villa first emerged in 2021 by the team of&nbsp;Navalny, who said that budget funds were used to lease the property from Kovalchuk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navalny&#8217;s team also previously alleged Putin owns a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13869364/putins-1bn-palace-removed-from-maps-spying-fears/\">£1billion Black Sea&nbsp;palace&nbsp;at Gelendzhik</a>&nbsp;&#8211; which included a red velvet pole-dancing boudoir and a casino.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another close Putin friend, billionaire Arkady Rotenberg, 69, later claimed the property was his.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21962095\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mystery-putins-secret-mountain-palace-808176812.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962095\" width=\"960\" height=\"582\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>YouTube/Navalny Live</figcredit></figure>The basement is home to a spa, complete with a pool, steam rooms, and Finnish-style and herbal saunas[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21961965\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000808176864.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21961965\" width=\"960\" height=\"588\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>YouTube/Nalvany Live</figcredit></figure>The distance between the air defence system and Putin&#8217;s mountain residence[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21961991\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mystery-putins-secret-mountain-palace-808176814.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21961991\" width=\"960\" height=\"506\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>YouTube/Navalny Live</figcredit></figure>How Navalny&#8217;s team geolocated the air defence system in Sochi[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21961967\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mystery-putins-secret-mountain-palace-808176815.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21961967\" width=\"960\" height=\"558\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>YouTube/Navalny Live</figcredit></figure>The supposed blueprints of Putin&#8217;s ski lodge[/caption]"},{"title":"Former porn star Lana Rhoades posts cheeky pic but fans mock ‘hideous’ detail in her photo","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21966678/lana-rhoades-cheeky-pic-fans-mock-hideous-detail/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 14:45:47 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Olivia Burke"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Instagram"},{"#cdata-section":"Porn"},{"#cdata-section":"Porn stars"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21966678 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>FORMER porn star Lana Rhoades flashed her followers in a cheeky pic &#8211;

behind Brazil and Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many attended church on Palm Sunday marked the beginning of Holy Week with prayers for the health of Pope Francis, while others performed flagellation rituals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures show the hooded penitents marching through the streets of Mandaluyong city as they beat themselves with bamboo tipped whips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the force of the blows that blood can be seen flowing from their wounds as they lie face down on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other penitents had their backs slashed with sharp objects as they also lie with their faces pressed to the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The barefoot devotees also kneel down on the road during the bizarre rituals as by-standers look on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others had stakes tied tied to their arms with the points digging into their bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other rituals include Filipino Catholics <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5943288/good-friday-easter-2018-crucifixion-philippines/\">nailing themselves to crosses </a>in a gruesome Good Friday re-enactment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They include Ruben Enaje, 63, who will be nailed on Good Friday for the 34th time to a wooden cross, with which he emulates the passion of Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enaje will drag a heavy 80lb cross for 1.2 miles through the streets of San Pedro de Cutud, before the palms of his hands are pierced to be crucified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I will offer this to people who have been affected by Covid-19, and I pray to our Lord that this disease will suddenly disappear because many people have suffered from the pandemic,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Catholic Church, the faith of 80 per cent of Filipinos, has expressed disapproval of self-flagellation and considers it an extreme misinterpretation of faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archbishop Socrates Villegas has implored Catholics to mark Lent with prayers and acts of love and charity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead of spilling your blood on the streets, why not walk into a Red Cross office and donate blood? Choose to share life. Share your blood,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21965092\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808174555-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965092\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Penitents praying on their knees during the ritual[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21965018\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808174557.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965018\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Those taking part in the ritual lying on the ground[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p></p>"},{"title":"We are couple with ‘world’s most body modifications’ – people think we are demons after covering bodies in devil tatts","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21963877/worlds-most-body-modifications-people-demons/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 12:11:29 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"James Liveris"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Body Shapes"},{"#cdata-section":"guinness world records"},{"#cdata-section":"Tattoos"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21963877 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>A COUPLE covered with the world&#8217;s most tattoos and body modifications have been mistaken as &#8220;demons&#8221;

carved into his scalp, alongside £400 metal horns implanted into his skull.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man recalled getting his first inking at 13 with the word f**k across the fingers on his left hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, he became obsessed – with more that 95 per cent of his body inked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor aspired to emulate a demon, which caught the eye of his now wife, Gabriela, who have been happily married for the last 15 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The couple now have a combined 91 tattoos and modifications between them as the look to renew their record for its ten year anniversary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gabriela told NeedToKnow: &#8220;When we received the title, I felt immense emotion and pride at being awarded for my choice of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been faithful to what I like and the image I want to have, respecting my inner being, which has been closely linked to art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Growing up in my grandparent’s house, I breathed art 24-hours a day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My grandfather was a musician and a photographer, with my grandmother a painter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I grew up with art all around me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor, 52, has always had skin in the game &#8211;

the couple fell victim to online trolls who branded them &#8220;Cherubs from&nbsp;hell&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor said: &#8220;People react in different ways&#8230; surprise, curiosity and fear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re often congratulated for our courage and for being daring, both with the pain threshold and tolerance for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But also because we’re confronting society by choosing a lifestyle that&#8217;s so different to other people without having any type of concerns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We live it naturally and without prejudice – we simply are and we live as we want.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21963953\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 693px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/84-now-ve-renewed-title-808136608.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21963953\" width=\"683\" height=\"779\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Jam Press/@victor_h_peralta</figcredit></figure>The &#8216;demon&#8217;

</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UH-60JA Black Hawk helicopter disappeared Thursday afternoon while on a reconnaissance mission in Japan&#8217;s southern islands, according to the head of the Ground Self-Defense Force, Yasunori Morishita.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It disappeared from radar only 10 minutes after departing from a base on Miyako Island and is believed to have crashed into the water between Miyako and nearby Irabu Island to the northwest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The area is about 1,120 miles southwest of Tokyo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coast guard patrol ships found an unused lifeboat whose serial number matched that of the missing helicopter and a door believed to belong to the same aircraft near the presumed crash site, army officials stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyodo News said Japanese coast guard ships also found traces of oil and what appeared to be the helicopter&#8217;s rotor in the sea, according to local reports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The army said the helicopter had a routine safety inspection in late March. No abnormality was found during its subsequent test flight or on its trip from its home base of Kumamoto to Miyako island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan started deploying the Black Hawk, a twin-engine, four-bladed utility helicopter developed by U.S. manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft and produced by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, in 1999 for rapid response, surveillance, and disaster relief missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CHOPPER HORROR </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The chopper, belonging to Japan&#8217;s Ground Self-Defense Force, had two pilots, two mechanics, and six crew members on board when it disappeared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to local media reports, senior Japanese army commander Yuichi Sakamoto was on the helicopter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: &#8220;We will do our utmost to save their lives.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chief of staff of the Japanese army said: &#8220;The radar track disappeared in the ocean north-northwest of Miyako Island. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Based on the discovered debris, it is presumed to be an aircraft accident.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese army said the aircraft belongs to a base in on Japan&#8217;s southern main island of Kyushu and was visiting Miyako Island on a surveillance mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located about 400km east of Taiwan, Miyako Island is home to the Japanese army&#8217;s missile unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, six people were killed after an Air Self-Defense Force U-125 inspection plane crashed in the mountains in Kagoshima.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21973925\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 730px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-words-door-reads-ground-808310581.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973925\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>The Black Hawk helicopter disappeared Thursday afternoon while on a reconnaissance mission in Japan&#8217;s southern islands[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21965161\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 410px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/JAPAN-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=400\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965161\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>NHK</figcredit></figure>Patrol ships have been searching for the missing helicopter since it vanished[/caption]"},{"title":"I had recurring dreams about 8 numbers & even saw them in real life – I was stunned when I used them to buy lotto ticket","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21964325/recurring-dreams-8-numbers-saw-real-life-lottery-ticket/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 11:45:43 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Taryn Pedler"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Lotto"},{"#cdata-section":"National Lottery"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21964325 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>A WOMAN was left stunned when she hit the lotto jackpot after dreaming of numbers &#8211;

My current job allows me the flexibility to do that… my former job did not.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mum has a range of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/side-hustle/\">side hustles</a> that include selling visual adult content, a drop shipping website and talking to people for a fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it didn&#8217;t come without its own set of challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Being a single mum on OnlyFans and being from a small town; I&#8217;ve copped so much judgement,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My work is not illegal, and it&#8217;s just the same as anybody else&#8217;s internet business.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucy is now hoping that other single mums hear about her journey and become inspired to invest in the property market with these &#8220;work from anywhere&#8221; platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said that &#8220;coming from absolutely nothing&#8221; meant she didn&#8217;t want to be risky with her money &#8211; so opted for property as the safest way to invest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when the OnlyFans model first began discussing building an investment property with her kids, they wanted to know how they could contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucy revealed how she was touched at their gestures and said: &#8220;My kids both gave me $100 each to &#8216;invest&#8217; in this new house; once we have tenants in it, they&#8217;ll both receive $5.50 each a week.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mum said her two boys came up with the idea themselves and earned the money from doing chores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It never even crossed my mind to include the kids in buying investment properties but my eldest son is so excited and is constantly talking to me about how to maximise their investment,&#8221; Lucy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They have already worked out that by the time they are adults themselves, they will have enough for their own house deposits &#8211; all from this initial $100 deposit as children.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucy has explained how she is wary of the potential future challenges her kids may face getting into the property market once they are adults.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Buying a property is such a huge hurdle. There is no way I could have bought a property as a single mother without OnlyFans,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My boys won&#8217;t be receiving hand-outs or trust funds &#8211; but I will put them through the best schools and I will help them be financially smart.

claiming it is politically motivated and led by the Democrats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He faces <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21945089/president-donald-trump-court-appearance-criminal-charges/\">34 counts of falsifying business records</a> in the first degree. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy&#8217;s 90-minute chat with Piers is her first TV interview since Trump&#8217;s arrest on Tuesday, broadcast on TalkTV in the UK and released on streaming service Fox Nation in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sun columnist Piers described the interview as &#8220;astonishing&#8221; &#8211; and said he was giving the former porn star a chance to tell her story &#8220;about the fling that may send President Trump to prison&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And during their chat, Stormy vowed she will testify if Trump&#8217;s case goes to trial, saying she has &#8220;nothing to hide&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You weren’t asked to give evidence to the grand jury, but you may be asked to testify if this ends up as a trial. How do you feel about potentially testifying in a trial that will be watched around the world?&#8221; Piers asked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy replied: &#8220;Any time you’re up in the public eye it’s scary. I mean, used to get scared giving an oral book report in school, so it’s daunting, but I look forward to it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She went on: &#8220;I have nothing to hide. I’m the only one that has been telling the truth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And, you know, you can’t shame me even more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So I feel like if they don’t, it paints the picture that they know something about me that makes me you know, untrustworthy, or not reliable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think having them call me in and put me on the stand legitimises my story and who I am,&#8221; added Stormy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Stormy &#8211; who is a registered Republican but said she did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 &#8211; told Piers that she does not believe he should face jail for his alleged crimes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she explained that for other alleged crimes he is under investigation for &#8211; Trump could end up being sent to prison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump is currently also under investigation for mishandling government documents, over allegations of fraud, and for attempting to interfere with the 2020 presidential election. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy told Piers: &#8220;I feel like the other things that he has done, if he is found guilty, absolutely.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;TELL THE TRUTH&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>She also urged Trump, who she claims got his bodyguard to ask for her phone number, to &#8220;tell the truth&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy added: &#8220;If you continue to do this you are setting a precedent where people think that they won&#8217;t held accountable and I&#8217;m afraid there are gong to be a lot of people hurt.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She warned if Trump escapes jail if found guilty of other crimes it could &#8220;open the door for other people to think they can get away with doing that and worse&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath of his bombshell court appearance, Trump raged the US is &#8220;going to hell&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 76-year-old is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination and will likely take on his nemesis Joe Biden in 2024</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His indictment is seen by many analysts as handing him the ticket &#8211; cauterising his hardline base who may have been turning towards rival Ron DeSantis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is using his legal trouble as a way to rile up his diehard supporters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it remains to be seen how his arrest will play with key swing voters who were turned off by Trump in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stormy also revealed &#8220;one in ten&#8221; messages she receives are death threats and she wishes she&#8217;d never met Trump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;They [the messages] would always be from an account somebody created just to do that with no followers, hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s different, the tone is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And they are way more specific and graphic. They seem to be more serious in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not hiding &#8211; these people are using their phone numbers, and their actual emails and their actual Twitter accounts &#8211; which then makes it worse because they actually have followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They genuinely feel they are doing something right.&nbsp;It makes you become paranoid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964408\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-new-york-807814747.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964408\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Trump waves as he arrives in court in New York[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964400\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-u-s-president-donald-807822941.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964400\" width=\"960\" height=\"639\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>He sits with members of his legal team at the hearing in Manhatten[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964415\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-us-president-donald-trump-807863554-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964415\" width=\"960\" height=\"612\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Trump speaks at an event in Mar-a-Lago[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>After returning home to his Mar-a-Lago resort from New York on Tuesday, Trump gave a venomous speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking out to &#8220;God Bless the USA&#8221;, Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case &#8211;

with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Watch the full interview on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channel in the UK or on Fox Nation <strong><em>in</em></strong> the US.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Available on Sky 522, Sky Glass 508, Virgin Media 606, Freeview 237 and Freesat 217 as well as on DAB, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Samsung TV Plus, YouTube, the Talk.TV website and TalkTV iOS and Android apps.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964427\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-u-s-president-donald-807837734.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964427\" width=\"960\" height=\"734\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Trump appears to scowl in a court sketch[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21964198\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stormy4jpg-JS808189239.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"Stormy Daniels on Piers Morgan  Talk TV  Programme, Sun Screengrab\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964198\" width=\"960\" height=\"479\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stormy spoke to Sun columnist Piers Morgan</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>"},{"title":"We rented out our house while we were still living there with a simple trick – we made £2,200 in the first month","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21961807/rented-house-while-living-simple-trick/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 10:40:45 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"James Liveris"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Home transformations"},{"#cdata-section":"Homes"},{"#cdata-section":"Money saving"},{"#cdata-section":"TikTok"},{"#cdata-section":"Tips tricks and life hacks"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21961807 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>A SAVVY homeowner has banked £2,200 in a month, while she was on holiday <strong>with a simple housing hack</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman, who owns a two-by-one duplex, claimed there was money to be made regardless if a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/\">home</a> was occupied by a family.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21962534\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 550px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/make-2k-a-month-taken-808177998.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=540\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962534\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok/ scrunchyfi</figcredit></figure>The savvy homeowner showed how she earnt easy money with a housing hack[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21962543\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 550px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/make-2k-a-month-taken-808177906.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=540\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962543\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok/ scrunchyfi</figcredit></figure>Despite her messy family living in the home, the woman was able to hide it from the guests[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/\">TikToker</a> @scrunchyFi revealed the cash grab trick in a video, whilst she enjoyed the sunshine in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/5759251/costa-rica/\">Costa Rica</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage showed her abode that offered two small bedrooms, a bathroom and a common living area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/america/\">US</a> woman explained she lived in the house with her family but she used a simple trick when she wanted to rent it out for some extra savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;This is how I rented my house for one month while I lived in Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My house is a two-bedroom, one-bathroom duplex but I only rented out one room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I kept the kids&#8217;

she warned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don’t want to be dramatic. What does war in space look like? We probably won’t see it with our naked eye but we will definitely feel the consequences from the moment it begins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admiral&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19230983/russia-50k-troops-dead-ukraine-war/\">Sir Tony Radakin</a> also laid out the danger of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19972975/putin-could-carry-out-attacks-from-space-tony-radakin/\">space weapons</a> last September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[Russia] has capabilities in space. We saw an example of that at the tail end of last year, when Russia exploded an object in space which created immense debris,&#8221; said Sir Tony. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Russia has increased its own cyber warfare and spy in the sky capability by boosting its military satellite capability during the war against Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage last week showed a Soyuz-2.1v launch from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Arkhangelsk region &#8211; the latest in a succession of Defence Ministry payloads sent into orbit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vlad hasn&#8217;t made the gains he or his commanders expected and Russia has found itself bogged down a long, brutal war as humiliating defeats pile up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tyrant now seemingly has his future tied to his success or failure in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin foolishly believed his forces would be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators when he invaded last February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead the initial attack ended in a disaster which saw his forces devastated and thrown back to Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyiv continues to call for Western support to help them defeat Putin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world is now awaiting to see if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21907573/ukraine-tanks-challenger-2-bloodiest-battle/\">Ukraine will mount its long expected counter offensive</a>, with much of the fiercest fighting currently

shirt,&#8221;&nbsp;he <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65188013\">told the BBC.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To be truly honest, it&#8217;s as if my brain did not register what was going on. As I turned to the left and looked down I saw the cobra.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then had to break the alarming news to those on board as he prepared to make an emergency landing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I did inform the passengers: &#8216;Listen the snake is inside the aircraft, it&#8217;s underneath my seat, so let&#8217;s try and get down to the ground as soon as we can.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You could hear a needle drop and I think everyone froze for a moment or two.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beechcraft Baron 58 was on its way from Bloemfontein to Pretoria but diverted to the city of Welkom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the relieved passengers and pilot rapidly got off the plane, a snake catcher was brought in to find the cobra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the appearance of the snake was terrifying, it wasn&#8217;t entirely surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the plane took off from Worcester flying club, two employees had spotted the snake underneath it and unsuccessfully tried to grab it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They even took a picture of the snake on the ground by one of the wheels, underneath an engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erasmus looked for the snake before boarding the aircraft with his passengers, but &#8220;unfortunately it was not there so he assumed it had slithered away&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We all then safely assumed that it must have crawled out overnight or earlier that morning, which was on Monday,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the efforts of the snake handler and engineers who stripped the plane after it landed, the elusive serpent has yet to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erasmus’s cool handling of the situation has won the praise of Poppy Khosa, the South African Civil Aviation commissioner, who hailed him as a hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh my goodness this could have been disastrous. Great airmanship indeed which saved all lives on board,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Such an amazing story and great handling of the situation by the pilot. Bravo to great airmanship.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modest Erasmus himself brushed it off, saying “it&#8217;s also my passengers that remained calm as well”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This was definitely a first and not something you get trained to handle,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cape Cobra is found throughout in southern Africa, especially South Africa, Namibia and Angola, and its venom can kill in 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adults can measure up to 5ft long and are recognisable from their hood which is used to intimidate potential predators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cobra’s adventure comes after a python hitched a ride from Australia to the UK <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8504739/snakes-on-a-plane-to-glasgow/\">in a tourist’s suitcase.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moira Boxall, from Stirling, found the spotted python in a shoe after returning from a family holiday in Queensland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, passengers on board a flight in America were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3146490/pet-snake-us-flight/\">left horrified</a> when a live snake was found on board by a young boy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8504739/snakes-on-a-plane-to-glasgow/\"><br></a></p>"},{"title":"Ex-Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi, 86, diagnosed with leukaemia after intensive care treatment in cardiac unit","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21960210/silvio-berlusconi-cancer-italy-leukaemia/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 06:58:13 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Henry Holloway"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Cancer (disease)"},{"#cdata-section":"Health"},{"#cdata-section":"Leukaemia"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21960210 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p><strong>FORMER Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been diagnosed with blood cancer </strong>after a hospital dash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The billionaire media mogul, 86, who has been in and out of the hospital in recent years, is currently in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/milan/\">Milan</a>&#8216;s San Raffaele Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21960252\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/go-italy-silvio-berlusconi-arrives-379091611-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960252\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP or licensors</figcredit></figure>Silvio Berlusconi is one of the most colourful characters in European politics[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21963035\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-berlusconi-stable-condition-second-808183774.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21963035\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>His daughter Marina Berlusconi arrives in hospital to see him[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21960318\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/general-view-intensive-care-unit-808029474.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960318\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Berlusconi is hospitalised at the San Raffaele hospital in Italy[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Italian media reports he was hospitalised with pneumonia after a diagnosis of leukaemia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was admitted into hospital with heart problems and shortness of breath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is reported his condition is serious but stable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leukaemia is an aggressive and fast-acting cancer of the white blood cells. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is undergoing intensive therapy to fight the disease, reports <a href=\"https://www.corriere.it/politica/diretta-live/23_aprile_06/condizioni-berlusconi-oggi-diretta-64667d72-d436-11ed-b15d-00361b7c9d2d.shtml\">Corriere della Sera</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former Prime Minister is the leader of the Forza Italia party which makes up part of the Italy&#8217;s ruling coalition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/\">Berlusconi</a>&nbsp;&#8211;

headed by close Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, and is responsible for Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as Putin welcomed Lukashenko to Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in their opening public remarks both despots steered clear of the war in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine\">Ukraine.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry

today told the new ambassadors:&nbsp;&nbsp;“We won’t be able to talk in person, but in the course of your work, I’m sure this opportunity will come up again and again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dmitry Peskov, his spokesman, made clear Putin did not intend a hold separate ceremony with America’s first ever woman ambassador to Moscow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the ceremony, Putin said: “Sadly our ceremony

obsessed with securing his safety &#8211; and being rattled by fears the West are bugging his calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The captain in the Federal Guard Service, known as the FGS or FSO, has fled Russia to

the 1990s[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Dorian has competed among big names in his sport, including Ronnie Coleman, Flex Wheeler and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He later went on to win Mr Olympia six times in a row in the 1990s, and he attributes his winning mindset to his tracksuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a snap shared to his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/\">Instagram</a>, he told how the bright blue matching track set allowed him to enter a champion&#8217;s mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dorian said: &#8220;Here’s a shot where I was warming up backstage wearing my Tardis tracksuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I actually named this particular tracksuit, The Tardis… the police telephone box from the popular <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/science-fiction/\">British TV sci-fi series, Dr. Who.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Only really my inner circle knew why I named the tracksuit The Tardis, here’s why.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dorian went on to explain how in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/doctor-who/\">Dr. Who</a>, The Tardis is bigger on the inside than the outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By wearing the tracksuit which made him appear smaller than he was, he showed up his opponents and threw them off before competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dorian reflected: &#8220;I wore it to deliberately give an image of a ‘smaller’ physique to confuse my rivals and people would comment, asking each other why I wasn’t bigger, as they were expecting me to be… little did everyone know, I’d probably be a career heaviest!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I always left my tracksuit on until the very last minute as I would feel every eye glancing at me from my competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When it eventually was time for The Tardis to come off, my gargantuan physique was unveiled for all to see.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tactic clearly led Dorian to victory, as he went to have an incredibly successful career throughout the 1990s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;My competitors have often said that it felt like there was a force field around me that roared victory… I almost felt unbeatable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dorian earned the nickname &#8220;The Shadow&#8221; for his tendency to sneak up on his opponents and win titles easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow big name bodybuilder <a

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china\">China</a>, which has long claimed democratically-governed <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/taiwan\">Taiwan</a> as its own territory, has warned of unspecified retaliation if the meeting goes ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last August, Beijing staged war games around Taiwan following the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19400622/china-taiwan-latest-military-operations-nancy-pelosi-visit/\">visit to Taipei of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan&#8217;s defence ministry said the Chinese ships, which were led by the carrier the Shandong, passed through the Bashi Channel &#8211; which separates Taiwan from the Philippines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group then went into waters to Taiwan&#8217;s southeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said the ships were going for training in the Western Pacific, and that Taiwanese naval and air forces and land-based radar systems closely monitored them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ministry said: &#8220;The Chinese communists continue to send aircraft and ships to encroach in the seas and airspace around Taiwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In addition to posing a substantial threat to our national security, it also destroys the status quo of regional security and stability. Such actions are by no means the acts of a responsible modern country.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One picture provided by the ministry shows a grainy black and white image of the carrier taken from the air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other meanwhile shows a Taiwanese sailor looking at the Shandong and another unidentified ship in the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China has yet to comment on the carrier group, whose appearance also coincided with the arrival in Beijing of French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March of last year, the Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait, just hours before the Chinese and US presidents were due to talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan&#8217;s defence ministry, in its statement about the Shandong&#8217;s latest mission near the island, said that &#8220;external pressure will not hinder our determination to go into the world&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country&#8217;s military will continue to closely monitor the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and uphold the principles of &#8220;not escalating conflicts, not causing disputes&#8221; to deal with any challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy today in California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is the most senior US figure to meet a Taiwanese leader on U.S. soil since 1979 despite threats of retaliation from China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said there was nothing new about a Taiwanese president transiting through the America and Beijing should not use it as an excuse to take action or ratchet up tensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporters waving Taiwan flags and pro-Taiwan and Hong Kong banners chanted Jiayou Taiwan &#8211; the equivalent of &#8220;Go Taiwan&#8221; &#8211; in the Reagan Library parking lot ahead of their arrival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After McCarthy and Tsai went inside, a small plane flew over the library towing a pro-Beijing banner saying &#8220;One China! Taiwan is part of China!&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meeting is expected to draw a strong reaction from Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory and has vowed to bring it under its control, by force if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China has repeatedly warned against a meeting between McCarthy and Tsai, who is on her first US stopover since 2019,.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, it is feared it may already be too late to stop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21661092/putin-boosting-china-nuclear-arsenal/\">President Xi</a>&nbsp;unleashing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2302257/pearl-harbor-time-attack-bomb/\">Pearl Harbor</a>-style surprise before the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the danger was laid bare as <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21753359/taiwanese-soldiers-war-games-chinese-skyscrapers-invasion/\">The Sun visited the front line</a> at Taiwan-controlled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19413271/china-live-fire-drills-taiwan-strait/\">Kinmen Island</a>, just two miles from the Chinese coast, in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explosions and gunfire could be heard as Taiwanese troops trained at secret military installations hidden from public view along the coastline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miles of spiked steel sea defences pointing towards China lined beaches ready to repel an amphibious landing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese drones have been taunting troops defending the island in recent months as spy ships disguised as trawlers lurked offshore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategy echoes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin’s</a>&nbsp;behaviour before he ordered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20888209/ukraine-news-latest-war-russia-putin/\">Russian forces</a>&nbsp;into Ukraine last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Lin Ching-Yi, a legislator on Taiwan’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told The Sun: “They are exactly the same tactics as Russia’s before the Ukraine invasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“An information war sews doubt and interferes with the democratic process and we now have serious fears that military action will follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Xi and Putin are both old men who want to make history and leave a lasting legacy. If Xi wants to achieve the unification (of China and Taiwan) that he has promised during his lifetime, that could mean war very soon. We need to be ready.”</p>"},{"title":"Inside Finland’s terrifying arsenal on new Nato frontier where 200,000 Russians were slaughtered in the ‘White

military capabilities with its developed defence force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just its excess of war-ready machines that is to be feared, footage has emerged of its <a aria-label=\"elite ski troops (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1643127811765415936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">elite ski troops</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The angry Finnish soldiers were seen powering through thick powder as they carried huge packs and weapons &#8211; ready to kill their enemy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to military experts, Finland is one of the most combat-ready forces in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also one of few <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/\">European</a> countries to have retained a conscription army through decades of peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland trains 21,000 new conscripts every year, who then become part of its troop reserve of 280,000 soldiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, the country has 870,000 Finns aged between 17 and 60 liable for service in case of need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are all trained and equipped with one primary aim &#8211; to repel any Russian invasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland&#8217;s ground force boasts 650 tanks with about 200 of them being German-made Leopards types 2A6 and 2A4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its impressive artillery has more than 1,500 weapons including 700 howitzers, 700 mortars and about 100 rocket launchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Finnish Air Force and Navy is also not to be scoffed at &#8211; commanding impressive fleets in both regards, which are set to grow within the next ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as the Nato chief praised the Finns during their official ascension on April 4, 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4425500/nato-secretary-world-is-in-danger/\">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, secretary general of Nato, said: &#8220;President Putin started the war against Ukraine with the clear goal of having less Nato [near Russia&#8217;s borders].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is getting exactly the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will raise the Finnish flag for the first time here at Nato headquarters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It will be a good day for Finland&#8217;s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Finnish contribution will add more than 257,000 troops to the combined forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move has also roughly doubled the West&#8217;s transatlantic frontier facing <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland and Russia share a painful 810 mile border with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/\">Kremlin</a> condemned the new alliance and has threatened to bolster its border defences in the western region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was not that long ago when the Soviet Union suffered huge losses on that same demarcation line &#8211; known as the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18642730/worlds-deadliest-ever-sniper-the-white-death-lesson-putin/\">&#8220;Winter War&#8221;.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 1939, the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17791194/which-countries-soviet-union/\">Soviet Union</a> with its millions of men, tens of thousands of tanks and aircraft invaded Finland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Soviets wanted a lease on the Hankö peninsula on the southern Finnish coast for use as a naval base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with less than a tenth of its counterparts army, the small country refused to cede and fought back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Finnish sniper in particular, dubbed <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18642730/worlds-deadliest-ever-sniper-the-white-death-lesson-putin/\">&#8220;The White Death&#8221;,</a> terrorised the invading forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simo Hayha shot dead more than 500 Russian soldiers during the battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a conflict that has become infamous as the brave Finnish troops managed to rout the much larger Russian army &#8211; leaving 70,000 dead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unbelievable feat is still celebrated today in Finland and lingers as a cautionary tale for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin&#8217;s</a> men.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21953686\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

test since 2017[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/us/\">US</a> long-range planes took part in joint aerial drills with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-korea/\">South Korean</a> fighter jets on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the first deployment of the B-52 bombers to the peninsula in a month, South Korea&#8217;s Defense Ministry said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can be fitted with nuclear-able cruise missiles and precision air-to-surface rockets, as well as carrying more than 30 tonnes of bombs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drills were a direct jab at brutal tyrant <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-jong-un/\">Kim Jong Un</a>, amid&nbsp;fears that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/\">North Korea</a>&nbsp;might conduct its first nuclear test since 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21910909/satellite-high-activity-north-korean-nuclear/#\"></a>The countries teamed up to &#8220;show the strong resolve of the (South) Korea-U.S. alliance and its perfect readiness to respond to any provocation by&nbsp;North Korea&nbsp;swiftly and overwhelmingly,&#8221; Lt. Gen. Park Ha Sik, commander of the South Korean air force operation command, said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both nations have bolstered their combined military drills in response to North Korea&#8217;s mounting threats of unleashing missiles and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/\">nukes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just last week, the US sent the nuclear-powered USS Nimitz aircraft carrier for joint naval training with South Korea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was followed by the parade in the skies of the B-52 bombers as well as anti-submarine drills this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rear Adm. Christopher Sweeney said the maritime exercises were &#8220;a tangible symbol of a shared goal in ensuring regional stability and economic well-being for all nations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commander of Carrier Strike Group 11 added: &#8220;The U.S., Japan, and Korea are three maritime nations who share a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific by working together to develop mutual trust, partnership, and capability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But North Korea is gearing up for an ambush on all fronts &#8211; and claims to have <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21820394/north-korea-tests-nuclear-underwater-drone-radioactive-tsunami/\">tested a new nuclear underwater attack drone that triggers a &#8220;radioactive tsunami</a>&#8221; in early March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21910909/satellite-high-activity-north-korean-nuclear/\">Disturbing satellite pictures also showed a flurry of activity</a> at the country&#8217;s main nuclear complex in the wake of Kim&#8217;s latest threats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The images emerged soon after he&nbsp;ordered increased production of bomb fuel to expand his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/\">rogue state&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;nuclear weapons arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The allies conducted their <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21693417/biggest-war-games-north-korean-border-submarine-salvo/\">biggest field exercises in five years last month</a>, practicing war games with computer simulations and field training exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures showed tanks and choppers readying for drills at a training field in the border city of Yeoncheon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This further riled Kim, who accused the US of preparing to invade his homeland and said he would squash their plot with &#8220;the toughest counteraction&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He ordered his troops to be on standby to respond to the &#8220;frantic war preparation moves&#8221; from the US and South Korea &#8211; which he views as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21250803/kim-jong-un-nuke-for-nuke-confrontation-red-line/\">invasion rehearsal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the drills kicked off, North Korea fired two cruise missiles from a submarine off its east coast in an apparent retaliation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/\">North Korea</a>&nbsp;views the military exercises as a major security threat, America and South Korea said the drills are defensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim was last week seen inspecting nuclear warheads at a secret location amid his vows to build up his country&#8217;s nuclear capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same day he unveiled new, smaller nuclear warheads intended to be fitted onto smaller weapons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not known whether these miniature nuclear warheads are fully developed but such weapons are part of Kim&#8217;s larger nuclear plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US has beefed up its alliances in the region amid North Korea&#8217;s increasing nuclear threats, with more than 70 missile tests last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last year, Kim has been steadily expanding his nuclear arsenal and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21497734/north-korea-fires-missile-show-nuclear-combat-force/\">unleashed a barrage of banned missile tests</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts said Kim is trying to pressure the US into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear power and relax international economic sanctions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21952693\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"

champagne[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The source of their wealth ranges from fish farming to gaming with some building up successful businesses and others inheriting their fortunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there are 28 fewer US dollar billionaires, the currency used by Forbes in its list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of the overall list is luxury goods titan<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21724754/who-bernard-arnault-net-worth/\"> Bernard Arnault</a>, 74, who has an astronomical $211 billion (£168 billion) fortune from his Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LMVH) company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beneath that stratospheric level of wealth there are some younger billionaires who aren’t doing too badly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among them is Gustav Magnar Witzoe, who turned 30 this year and owns nearly half of Salmar ASA, one of the world&#8217;s largest salmon producers, worth $2.7 billion (£2.1 billion)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stake in the salmon empire was given to him by his dad, also named Gustav, who founded the company in 1993.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His son puts his chiselled good looks to use as a part-time model and his Instagram features him on the catwalk during New York Fashion Week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gustav Magnar Witzoen has a fondness for fast cars and has been pictured behind the wheel of a vintage Aston Martin and a Porsche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images have shown him globetrotting in style, touching down on everywhere from Italy and France to Dubai.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while he’s not afraid to show off his wealth, he is also proud of the fact he wasn’t spoiled by his parents and had a relatively modest upbringing while his dad built up the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He skipped university and put himself to work on salmon farms for two years to learn the trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another young billionaire who’s not shy about flaunting her lifestyle is Katharina Andresen, who along with her sister Alexandra, is worth $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair owe their wealth to a stake in their family’s investment company Ferd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her Instagram also shows her in posing various exotic locations and quaffing champagne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2017 she was fined £23,000 for drink driving but told a court she had no fixed income as her assets &#8220;have not yielded any dividend yet&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole Brit on the list is <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19953855/millionaire-lavish-life-ben-francis-gymshark-model-wife/\">Ben Francis</a>, who made his fortune through the fitness wear brand&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20037170/plus-size-woman-gym-shark-haul-xxl-fit/\">Gymshark</a>, which he founded in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many on the billionaire list, his is a genuine rags-to-riches story to which has seen him build a brand <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/17680844/gymshark-bestselling-workout-athleisure/\">worn by some of the biggest celebrities</a>&nbsp;around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The businessman married Canadian fitness model and influencer Robin in September 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair have given fans a glimpse into their VIP lifestyle through sharing pictures of their extravagant holidays, including one on the island of K&#8217;gari in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other posts see them in Dubai, where they are photographed in an opulent restaurant and on the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Ben was embroiled in a drug scandal when a video surfaced of him snorting cocaine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben is known for his love of motorcycles and has given fans a look at some of his expensive bikes, including one by Thornton Hundred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the list are the Del Vecchio brothers Leonardo, Luca and Clemente, who own their $3.5 billion (£2.8 billion) wealth to a stake in the Luxottica eyewear brand founded by their dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leonardo Del Vecchio has been pictured partying at the Pacha nightclub in Ibiza and with Ferrari racing cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set of siblings on the list are sisters Kim Jung-min and Kim Jung-youn, who inherited their $1.1 billion (£900 million) fortune from their dad Kim Jung-ju.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 54-year-old online gaming tycoon died last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of their fortunes are dwarfed by Mark Mateschitz, who received a 49 per cent share in the drinks company Red Bull, when his dad Dietrich&nbsp;passed away,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the tender age of 30, he now has a $34.7 billion (£27 billion) fortune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arnault has leaped Elon Musk to become

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19945075/ukraine-russia-worlds-biggest-ever-cyber-war-moscows-faltering/\">the biggest cyber war the world</a> has ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the beginning of Russia&#8217;s invasion, Putin’s army of hackers unleashed a barrage of &#8220;major cyber attacks&#8221; and a disinformation blitz to sow chaos and confusion in support of their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">bloodbath </a>operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the strikes &#8220;have largely failed&#8221; thanks to&nbsp;Ukraine’s&nbsp;heroic cyber defenders, Lindy Cameron, the boss of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together with its allies, the western keyboard warriors saved lives, &#8220;in the face of sophisticated and sustained&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;cyber aggression&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;Just as we have seen inspirational and heroic defence by&nbsp;Ukrainian&nbsp;military on the battlefield, we have seen incredibly impressive defensive cyber operations by Ukrainian cyber security practitioners.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unseen blitz in cyberspace is &#8220;probably the most sustained and intensive cyber campaign on record, with the Russian state launching a series of major&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cyber-crime-hacking/\">cyber attacks</a>&nbsp;in support of their illegal invasion,&#8221; she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2022, hacking group Anonymous claimed it released the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18160552/anonymous-russia-leak-soldiers-putin-ukraine-war/\">details of 120,000 Russian soldiers</a> in Ukraine to throw off the invaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

comes after a series of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/\">health</a> scares in recent years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlusconi was hospitalised for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/\">Covid</a>-related pneumonia in September 2020, but later recovered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the following year he was admitted several times for complications stemming from the deadly virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlusconi was forced to undergo open heart surgery in 2016 and surgery on his intestine three years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four-time prime minister, who is fitted with a pacemaker, has also overcome <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prostate-cancer/\">prostate cancer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But his time in office hasn&#8217;t been without controversy, as the party-loving former leader is well known for his sex scandals and eyebrow-raising jokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlusconi &#8211; who is in a relationship with Forza Italia MP Marta Fascina, 33 &#8211; allegedly held lavish &#8220;Bunga Bunga&#8221; bashes at his villa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was accused, but later acquitted, of paying young women for &#8220;silence and lies&#8221; surrounding the infamous gatherings, which he always insisted were simply elegant dinners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But guests claimed they were in fact wild sex parties with &#8220;orgies&#8221;, where women stripped and performed &#8220;raunchy pole dances&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PLAYBOY PM</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ex-PM, who previously described himself as the &#8220;Jesus Christ of politics&#8221;, also landed himself in hot water in 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was alleged that the lothario had abused his position of power to protect a young Moroccan nightclub dancer who was arrested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police detained Karima El-Mahroug, known by her stage name &#8216;Ruby the Heart Stealer&#8217;, for theft &#8211; but she was released after Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was charged with paying her for sex when she was just 17 and was found guilty, until he was acquitted in 2014. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An appeals court ruled there was no proof he knew El-Mahroug was a minor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlusconi was also temporarily banned from politics after a conviction of tax fraud in 2013. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He served a community sentence and muscled his way back into the spotlight before being re-elected as a senator in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berlusconi proved old habits died hard last year after <a

Colombian <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/\">social media</a> star Yeferson Cossio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news of the romance sent her follower count soaring, as her beau&#8217;s 10

apart from a boob job, she is 100 per cent natural. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared a sweet image of herself as a youngster with curly brown hair and pouting, claiming she has always had plump lips.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The influencer also squashed rumours she has had a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plastic-surgery/\">nose job</a>, insisting the snap corroborated her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carolina wrote: &#8220;Apparently I have dyed my hair and injected my lips, and as you can see from the photographs I must&#8217;ve been doing that since I was a

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/\">Melania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/\">former lawyer Michael Cohen</a> allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors argue this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he cannot allow &#8220;businesses to cover up criminal conduct&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The historic case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The indictment focused on Trump&#8217;s reimbursement checks to Cohen &#8211; with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing his trademark red tie and dark blue suit, Trump arrived at the court building on Tuesday flanked by a secret service and police motorcade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police estimated there were 300 Trump supporters near the court, with about 150 demonstrating against him. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21947141\"

“Trump lies all the time.” Another said: “Lock him up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump supporters, meanwhile, waved banners declaring “Trump or Death” and wrapped themselves in American flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Merchan banned TV cameras from the court after Trump’s lawyers argued it would create a “circus-like atmosphere”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the hearing, after a clerk read out the indictment number, 71543, the former president stayed seated and, in a throaty voice, declared: “Not guilty.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, he appeared calm and mostly stared ahead as he and his legal team entered the 15th-floor room of the Manhattan Criminal Courts building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known as Part 59, it is the same court where film mogul <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harvey-weinstein/\">Harvey Weinstein</a> was put on trial for rape and sexual assault. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the hearing, Trump was fingerprinted and processed inside the courthouse — but he didn’t have his mugshot taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hearing was then slightly delayed as his legal team reviewed the indictment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 24 court security officers and police plus four Secret Service agents stood guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five sketch artists sat in the jury box, furiously trying to capture the unprecedented scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the former president entered the courtroom, he briefly looked at a huddle of news cameras &#8211; but did not stop to speak to reporters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the court, Trump sat with his hands in his lap and his lawyers at his side, staring straight ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the hearing, Trump&#8217;s lawyer Todd Blanche said Trump is &#8220;absolutely frustrated, upset and believes that there is a great injustice happening in the courtroom&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s legal team plan file a motion to dismiss the case against him, one of his lawyers added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His next hearing is due to be held on December 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If found guilty he could face jail, although that is thought to be unlikely.<a

attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told police he had tried tie little Cleo to a chair but she fought back during her 18 day ordeal, which ended when <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16617893/amazing-moment-cleo-smith-safe-vanishing/\">police burst into his home.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I just used sticky tape, but it wasn&#8217;t working. So, I thought, &#8216;I won&#8217;t tie her up any more with the sticky tape&#8217;,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I tried to tie her to the chair and that with her hands, feet and mouth. I tried to do that. She was a bit of a fighter.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly also told cops he “roughed her up a few times” when she became “bossy” by asking for chocolate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His motivation for snatching Cleo was that he wanted a little girl he could dress up and play with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I, you know, wanted to hold on to her. I wasn&#8217;t planning to keep her forever,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passing sentence at a court in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/western-australia/\">Western Australia</a>, Judge Julie Wager&nbsp;heard during her captivity, terrified Cleo spent most days alone, trapped in a bedroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly altered the door handle so the room locked from the outside and put on the radio to drown out any noise she made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The young victim heard her name on the radio and she said they were saying her name,” said the judge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleo and her family’s ordeal began when Kelly unzipped Cleo&#8217;s family tent and discovered her sleeping inside, alongside her baby sister and parents, on October 16, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quietly bundled her into front seat of his car and drove the 47 mile journey back to his house in the town of Carnarvon, taking dirt tracks to avoid detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While holding Cleo captive, unemployed Kelly went about his usual routine and was spotted out in the community several times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He attended compulsory face-to-face meetings about searching for work, seeing relatives, and giving them lifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the while, an intensive search for Cleo was underway involving land and air crews, roadblocks and CCTV footage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually cops were able to identify Kelly as a suspect using mobile phone signals and thanks to a tip-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police cameras show the moment Cleo was carried in an officer’s arms to safety after cops burst into his home just before 1am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After little Cleo paused for a second, she told police words they had desperately wanted to hear throughout their hunt for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“M-my name is Cleo,” she replies as one of the clearly relieved cops says “hello Cleo!” and another says “you’re alright bubby”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he was arrested <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16631114/cleo-smith-kidnapper-obsessed-bratz-dolls/\">Kelly’s obsession</a> <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16631114/cleo-smith-suspect-obsessed-bratz-dolls/\"></a>with Bratz dolls, an American brand featuring scantily clad teenage figures, emerged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures show dozens of them in his house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One showed a room dedicated to the dolls, with shelves stacked to the ceiling showing a large number still in their boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his Facebook page he posted a video of himself with a filter showing hearts with the words “I love my dolls”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A psychiatrist consulted in the case said Kelly suffered from a severe personality disorder arising from childhood neglect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That led him to create a &#8220;fantasy world&#8221; with the existence of multiple imaginary children by different women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Wager noted Kelly&#8217;s own troubled upbringing, but said his risk of re-offending was high according to the advice of psychiatric experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You pose a high risk of seriously psychologically harming any future victim in the event that you did re-offend,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly will be eligible for parole in 11 years and six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946700\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 740px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2021-carnarvon-western-australia-police-691178651.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=730\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946700\" width=\"730\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Cleo was held for 18 days by Kelly before police freed her[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946718\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-accused-kidnapping-cleo-smith-691350666.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946718\" width=\"960\" height=\"899\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>INSTAGRAM</figcredit></figure>A room in Kelly&#8217;s house was dedicated to his doll collection[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>"},{"title":"Shadowy Putin rivals ‘plotting to take down despot claim responsibility’ for Vladlen Tatarsky ‘assassination’ in café","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21945814/putin-rivals-claim-responsibility-russian-blogger-assassination/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 00:23:38 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Iona Cleave"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Global politics"},{"#cdata-section":"Ukraine war"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21945814 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>RUSSIAN dissidents are understood to have claimed responsibility for the bombing that killed a Russian propogandist and have warned more is to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The underground anti-establishment group, known as the National Republic Army (NRA), have allegedly claimed to be behind <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/\">the attack on pro-Kremlin blogger Vladlen Tatarsky.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946028\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-russian-police-arrested-woman-807566562.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946028\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>The aftermath of the bomb that tore through a St Petersburg café which killed Tatarsky and injured over 30 others on Sunday[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946036\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-3.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946036\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, real name Maxim Fomin was killed by the bomb instantly[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946021\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/known-vladlen-tatarsky-nastya-seen-807704458-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946021\" width=\"960\" height=\"681\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Daria Trepova is seen delivering the Kremlin blogger with the statue[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21946019\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darya-trepova-suspected-killing-russian-807790981.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946019\" width=\"960\" height=\"612\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Trepova, 26, appeared in court on Tuesday charged with terrorism only hours before dissident Russians allegedly claimed their involvement[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"a statement (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://t.me/s/rospartizan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In a statement</a> published on the Russian social media app Telegram, the group claim to have organised and carried out the bombing attack that tore through a café in central St Petersburg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also praise the alleged assassin, Daria Trepova, 26, who they call a &#8220;hero&#8221;

in August of last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their alleged new statement reads: &#8220;We, the St. Petersburg column of the National Republican Army, declare:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We organized and carried out an action on April 2, 2023 against a group of Z-activists and personally against the well-known warmonger and war propagandist, war criminal Maxim Fomin, known as Vladlen Tatarsky.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group claim they received no outside foreign help and acted &#8220;autonomously&#8221;, which goes against the shaky claims made by Russian media outlets that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a> was responsible for the bombing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spokesperson for the group and well-known Russian exile, Ilya Ponomarev, also confirmed the NRA&#8217;s claims they masterminded the operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The partisans are resisting the current political system in&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;and want it to be removed&#8221;, he told <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1754894/putin-propagandist-bomb-kremlin-warning\">the Express.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They cannot join the fighting in the military, but they are holding the front inside&nbsp;Russia.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ponomarev claims the partisans wanted to make Putin-backing Kremlin elites aware that they are &#8220;not safe anymore&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The audience is the elites: &#8216;Beware, you are not safe anymore, Putin is not able to protect you, we are everywhere&#8217;,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group&#8217;s supposed statement continues with: &#8220;This action was carried out in a club owned by one of the most famous Russian gangsters and criminals, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/\">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a result of the action the club will stop its work.&nbsp;We are satisfied with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The action we carried out was not directed against civilians, and all the victims are among the active supporters of the war, justifying the war crimes of the Putin regime in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement then refers to Trepova as a &#8220;well-known figure in the leftist and feminist movement&#8221; and a &#8220;hero&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At a time when many &#8216;oppositionists&#8217; wrote posts on Facebook and shone flashlights, she fought, went to protests and risked her freedom by participating in all opposition movements that now refuse her.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Russian partisan group calls on human rights groups to help the suspect who they see as a &#8220;hostage of the system&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We call on the people of Russia to follow our example and provide all kinds of resistance to the criminal Russian regime up to its complete destruction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Criminals will not feel safe on Russian soil!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement signs off with: &#8220;Russia will be free!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Trepova will remain in Russian custody till June 2 while the trial is ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prosecutors alleged she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trepova&#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has previously been claimed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/\">Putin personally ordered Tatarsky&#8217;s assassination</a>&nbsp;and will use it to crush his rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telegram channel General SVR&nbsp;&#8211;

Two dozen police stood guard along the corridor, where the bathrooms had been closed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 24 court security officers and police plus four Secret Service agents stood guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five sketch artists sat in the jury box, furiously trying to capture the unprecedented scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg entered the court shortly before Trump and took a seat at the front right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As tension mounted and the temperature rose — the air conditioning was not on and the blinds were shut — Trump entered at 2.29pm, 14 minutes late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was wearing his trademark red tie and dark blue suit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He walked slowly towards the front, staring straight ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ex-President stood with his arms by his sides before being shown to a seat to the left where he sat next to his attorneys, Susan Necheles and Todd Blanche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Juan Merchan ordered both sides to calm down after prosecutors complained about Trump’s recent social media posts, including one of him holding a baseball bat against the head of the top prosecutor in the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge said he was not issuing a gagging order, as had been suggested, as Trump was a “candidate for President of the United States” and his “First Amendment rights are critically important”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the hearing, which lasted just under an hour, Trump took a private jet to his Florida home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was due to address his supporters from there late last night. Trump denies the claim by 44-year-old Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex once in 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/\">Melania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/\">former lawyer Michael Cohen</a> allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the historic hearing, Trump lashed out at Mr Bragg and claimed the DA had been influenced in bringing the charges by his wife, Jamila.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He will go down in Judicial history, and his Trump Hating wife will be, I’m sure, very proud of him!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump last Thursday but the charges had remained under seal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about President Joe Biden’s reaction to Trump’s arraignment and said: “This is not his focus today.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Trump critic Rep Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, tweeted: “A sombre moment in the life of our country, when it is necessary to arraign a former president on criminal charges. As the case falls to the District Attorney to prove, we must recognise what is most important: Even the most powerful are held to account, and that nobody is above the law.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the day the former President was seen leaving his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5294732/trump-tower-built-designer-donald-trump/\">Trump Tower</a> residence in the city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he wrote: “Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Seems so surreal — Wow, they are going to arrest me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump arrived at the court building in Manhattan flanked by a secret service and police motorcade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police estimated there were 300 Trump supporters near the court, with about 150 demonstrating against him. There were scuffles before police separated the groups in a park behind barricades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-Trump protesters rolled out a sign saying: “Trump lies all the time.” Another said: “Lock him up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump supporters, meanwhile, waved banners declaring “Trump or Death” and wrapped themselves in American flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945233\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anti-trump-protesters-demonstrate-outside-807799060.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945233\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Anti-Trump protester in a prison outfit outside the court[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945244\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-former-president-807783942.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945244\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Supporters of the ex-President make there thoughts clear with placards and T-shirts[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945245\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-city-former-807791724.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945245\" width=\"960\" height=\"626\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>A Trump supporter, left, clashes with a rival at the court[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Pro-Trump politician <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/marjorie-taylor-greene/\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> walked through the crowd and made bizarre claims comparing him to Jesus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “President Trump is joining some of the most incredible people in history in being arrested today.

Recruiting from the dregs of Russian jails, he tells murderers, rapists and robbers: “I need your criminal talents.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He promises that if they sur-vive six months on the front line — a tall order amid Russia’s chaotic battle plans — their con-victions will be quashed and they can go home as free men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one video, 61-year-old Prigozhin is heard telling convicts: “Do you have anyone else who can get you out of this jail, if you’ve got ten years to spend behind bars?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“God and Allah can, but in a wooden box. I can get you out of here alive. But I don’t always bring you back alive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those on the front line would be given two grenades — to blow themselves up if surrounded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prigozhin said: “No one is retreating. No one backs down. No one is being taken prisoner.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deserters, he told the lags, “will be shot”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others are terrified they will get the sledgehammer treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recruit — enamoured by the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/\">Wagner</a> leader’s brutal manner — said: “He’s one of us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Prigozhin is a violent convicted criminal himself. Born in Leningrad — now <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">St Petersburg</a> — in the Soviet Union in 1961, he was raised by his single mother, who worked at a local hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dreaming of a career as a professional cross-country skier, he graduated from a prestigious athletics boarding school in 1977.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A life in sport eluded him — so instead he turned to crime.<br>In 1979, aged just 18, he got a suspended two-and-a-half-year sentence for theft. Instead of jail he worked in a chemical factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years later Prigozhin and accomplices went on a robbing spree, during which they mugged a female victim at knifepoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prigozhin grabbed the woman from behind and choked her until she lost consciousness. He was jailed for 13 years, nine of which were in a high-security prison camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year a video emerged claiming he had performed sex acts on other prisoners.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21944737\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 710px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-reddit-com-r-russiaukrainewar2022-797322304.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944737\" width=\"700\" height=\"875\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Telegram</figcredit></figure>Prigozhin greets Akhmat special forces commander Apti Alaudinov and gives him a sledgehammer[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945485\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1684\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-shows-yevgeny-prigozhin-chief-799996033.jpg?strip=all\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945485\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Prigozhin this week claimed Wagner will soon take Bakhmut[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>A tattooed man claiming to be a crime boss said of Prigozhin: “He knew his place and he agreed to his place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro-Kremlin bloggers say the claims were a smear by Ukraine, while analysts believe his many political enemies inside Russia may be behind the suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was freed from prison in 1990, and the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17791194/which-countries-soviet-union/\">Soviet Union</a> collapsed the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prigozhin opened a hot dog stand — which soon flourished amid the chaos as Russia switched to a capitalist economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon he was running a chain of convenience stores, then several top-end restaurants in St Petersburg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jewel in his culinary crown was a floating restaurant called New Island, which sailed up and down the Neva River. When Japanese Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/13945911/tokyo-olympics-yoshiro-mori-sexism-row/\">Yoshiro Mori</a> visited Putin in April 2000, the pair dined on board the New Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prigozhin recalled that Putin “saw how I built a business out of a kiosk” and “saw that I had no problem serving plates to dignitaries in person”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2002 US <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/george-bush/\">President George W Bush</a> dined at the New Island with Putin and a year later the Russian president celebrated his birthday there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not a cook himself, Prigozhin soon earned the nickname “Putin’s chef” and the trust of Russia’s leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opposition leader Alexei Navalny — now behind bars — said of Prigozhin: “He became something like the court jester.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon he was awarded £2.5billion-worth of government contracts to cater for the army, schools and state banquets. Riches flowed and the father of three — married to business-woman Lyubov — was said to own a £7.5million estate, a private jet and a 121ft yacht worth £4.4million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he went from Putin’s chef to his private military contractor. In 2014 Prigozhin’s Wagner Group — named after Hitler’s favourite composer — began fighting in Ukraine’s Donbas region as Russia attempted to seize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaining a fearsome reputation for barbarity, the mercenary group propped up <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bashar-al-assad/\">Bashar al-Assad’s</a> regime in Syria, where a video showed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner murderers smashing a prisoner’s wrists and ankles with a sledgehammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they laughed as they decapitated the man and torched his remains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian journalist Denis Korotkov identified one of the killers as a former Russian policeman and said: “They’re out of control. I don’t think it’s an isolated case.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prigozhin glories in his army’s grisly reputation. Russian shops are selling a Wagner-engraved “souvenir” sledgehammer, etched with the mercenary fighters’ logo and a pile of skulls, in a presentation box that resembles a coffin as well as similarly-branded key rings and car stickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when the EU parliament labelled Russia a state sponsor of terrorism last November, Prigozhin said he was sending them one of the hammers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a video posted on one of Wagner’s Telegram channels, a sledgehammer daubed with fake blood was then seen being packed into a violin case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another film Prigozhin told “traitors” and rich Russians abroad: “The Wagner sledge-hammer will be waiting for you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For much of the unprompted invasion of Ukraine, which began last February, Wagner mercenaries have been engaged in “human wave” attacks at the logistics hub of Bakhmut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Wagner recruit Andrei Medvedev, now seeking asylum in Norway, said: “They would round up those who did not want to fight and shoot them in front of newcomers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They buried them in the trenches dug by the trainees.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, after months of trench warfare, Prigozhin claimed to have planted a Russian flag on the city’s town hall, adding that “in a legal sense, Bakhmut is ours”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukrainians</a> robustly deny the city has fallen. Yet the 50,000-strong private army — around a quarter of Russian forces in Ukraine — has added considerably to Prigozhin’s clout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has publicly insulted Russia’s military top brass, even “behaving like a parallel government”, as one analyst put it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some believe he may even be jockeying to succeed Putin as president. Yet recently there are signs that Putin may be reining in his former caterer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wagner can now no longer recruit from prisons and some believe the Russian high command has starved his group of munitions and support to cut Prigozhin down to size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex-Wagner man Medvedev — who calls his former commander “mad” — predicts a grisly end, saying: “Once this whole spectacle is over, I think his own men will kill him.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin’s chef may yet feel a sledgehammer blow himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945582\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 690px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/timegrab-yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-group-778009680-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945582\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pictured the violin-case ‘gift’ that Prigozhin sent to the EU</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21945491\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/putin-crony-yevgeny-prigozhin-trains-792257917-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945491\" width=\"960\" height=\"536\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Prigozhin trains former prisoners to fight in war[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21944728\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/yevgeny-prigozhin-wife-daughter-polina-644588849.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944728\" width=\"960\" height=\"710\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yevgeny Prigozhin with his wife and daughter Polina wearing Putin T-shirt</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>"},{"title":"Mystery of ‘fairy circles’ in Australian deserts may be SOLVED as ancient knowledge ‘ends long-standing science debate’","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21944446/mystery-fairy-circles-australian-deserts-solved/","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 21:18:13 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Katie Davis"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"science"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21944446 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>A LONG-standing scientific debate over the cause of bizarre &#8220;fairy circles&#8221; may have been solved by ancient knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mysterious patches of bare earth can be found across deserts in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/\">Australia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21944961\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/80-140-kilometres-coast-namib-807839199.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944961\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>SWNS</figcredit></figure>Fairy circles are patches of bare earth found in desert grass.

sparking fresh speculation over tensions between the mercenary group and Putin&#8217;s forces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Telegram channel General SVR&nbsp;&#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &#8211; has now suggested <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Mad Vlad</a> was behind the assassination. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The channel claimed the Russian tyrant was &#8220;pleased&#8221; with the killing of Tatarsky &#8211; and the successful hit will supposedly be used to fuel a new wave of attacks on his opponents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The liquidation of Tatarsky is a &#8216;brilliant&#8217; FSB special operation, according to Putin, which went exactly according to plan,&#8221; General SVR said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The development of the special operation and the choice of the victim were agreed with the president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Putin congratulated the leadership of the FSB and recommended it to continue in the same spirit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Tatarsky &#8211; real name was Maxim Fomin &#8211; supported Putin, he was also a vocal critic of the Kremlin&#8217;s leading military commanders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Putin was informed by his spies that Tatarsky was an &#8220;out of control moron military officer who only harms&#8221;, General SVR claimed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Telegram channel&#8217;s claims cannot be independently verified. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danilo delle Fave, military and intelligence analyst for ITSS Verona, also told The Sun Online the attack could have been carried out by the FSB. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The conquest of Bakhmut has become a matter of prestige for Wagner &#8211; if they manage to conquer the city they will put in shame the Russian army,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since Fomin was close to Wagner, and the event was staged in a Prigozhin-owned building, it could be a message the FSB and the military have sent to Wagner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The bomb attack could be the result of the infighting between the Russian establishment and the hardliners that wanted to exploit the war to achieve more power inside the Russian institutions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Fave also suggested the assassination &#8211; likely carried out by a small group of plotters &#8211; could have also been a false flag attack to ramp up support for Putin&#8217;s government. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The current mobilisation effort is sluggish, and an attack in the heart of the Russian Federation could be used to influence people to join the army,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fave also warned: &#8220;We should expect an increase in these kind of events as the Russians are unable to achieve their objectives in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former senior military intelligence officer Philip Ingram also said Tatarsky might have been killed to &#8220;send a message&#8221; to Wagner leader Prigozhin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also suggested it could have been carried out by Russia itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingram told Sky News Tatarsky was seen as &#8220;a part of Prigozhin&#8217;s inner team&#8221; and was more supportive of the private military group than Putin&#8217;s operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after new video emerged showing the pro-Putin propogandist engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/\">Trepova, who was arrested on Monday</a>, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former art student appears to be trying to edge out of the room &#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the café &#8211; perhaps to shield herself &#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further distressing footage appears to show the exact moment the bomb &#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the cafe moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charges carry a maximum jail term of 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It claimed she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee accused Ukrainian intelligence of organising the killing with help from supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trepova&#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21940265\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/head-wagner-private-army-yevgeny-807789586.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940265\" width=\"960\" height=\"617\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Head of Wagner private army Yevgeny Prigozhin visiting the cafe where Tatarsky died[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932672/russian-blogger-killed-video-st-petersburg/#\"></a></p>"},{"title":"Russia issues chilling nuke warning as Finland OFFICIALLY joins Nato taking bloc just 78 miles from Putin’s home city","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21935579/russia-chilling-nuke-warning-finlands-entry-nato/","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 11:57:27 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Aliki Kraterou"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"NATO"},{"#cdata-section":"Nuclear Weapons"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21935579 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>FINLAND officially joined Nato today &#8211;

a heavy blow to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto signed the official documents before handing them over Secretary of State Antony Blinken at Nato HQ in Brussels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland&#8217;s accession roughly doubles the length of the border Nato shares with Russia &#8211; and bolsters its eastern flank as the war in Ukraine rages on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blinken said: &#8220;With receipt of this instrument of accession, we can now declare that Finland is the 31st member of the North Atlantic Treaty.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland joining the military alliance is a direct result of Russia&#8217;s invasion of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;President Putin wanted to slam Nato&#8217;s door shut,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Today we show the world that he failed, that aggression and intimidation do not work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Sweden will also become a full-fledged member.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland&#8217;s accession ends decades of the country&#8217;s military non-alignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Finland and Sweden applied to join almost 12 months ago &#8211; but it was hampered by a refusal by Hungary and Turkey to ratify the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PM Rishi Sunak hailed Finland&#8217;s &#8220;historic&#8221; accession and urged the alliance to admit Sweden next after its entry was blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All Nato members now need to take the steps necessary to admit Sweden too, so we can stand together as one alliance to defend freedom in Europe and across the world,&#8221; Sunak said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has created an alliance that is now &#8220;bound tighter together&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said his country will work &#8220;relentlessly&#8221;

he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Measures will be taken dependent on that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mounting pressure from Nato also became the main topic of Russia&#8217;s TV program 60 Minutes and was lambasted by pundits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dmitry Abzalov said the situation involving Finland was a &#8220;mess&#8221; and &#8220;already out of our hands&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga Skabeyeva, Russia-1 host, went a step further and claimed the Finnish territory as &#8220;our historical land&#8221; and called for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a>&nbsp;to take action over Finland&#8217;s looming membership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: &#8220;We have to liberate the brotherly Finnish people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows last year&#8217;s claims that the Kremlin would take &#8220;adequate countermeasures&#8221; and would send 12 units and divisions to its western military district.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the hostile warning, Finland is expected to join the alliance today &#8211; which has been hailed by the Nato chief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finland will become the sixth Nato nation to share a border with Russia, joining&nbsp;Norway, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Finnish contribution will add more than 257,000 troops to the combined forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21937019\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-meeting-board-ministry-defense-804870253-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937019\" width=\"960\" height=\"651\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Belarusian aircraft has been upgraded to carry nuclear warheads[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21937355\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/flags-member-nations-flap-wind-807754901.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937355\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Finland&#8217;s historic entry into the military alliance is taking place today[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21937294\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/c85a642d-8e58-45ec-ae8a-c1f2b345a7a1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937294\" width=\"960\" height=\"652\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Finland&#8217;s Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen arrived in Brussels today</figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>"},{"title":"Paranoid Putin hides in bunkers to dodge assassination bids and is terrified of dying of Covid, says his ex-bodyguard","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21935894/putin-hides-in-bunkers-dodge-assassination-terrified-of-covid/","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 11:41:32 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Olivia Burke"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Global politics"},{"#cdata-section":"Nuclear Weapons"},{"#cdata-section":"Ukraine war"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21935894 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>PARANOID Vladimir Putin hides in his bunkers to dodge assassination attempts and is &#8220;mortally afraid&#8221;

and claimed he has brainwashed his minions to &#8220;worship him in every way&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Putin tries to keep a grip on his power, Karakulov claims he is also battling his own inner demons in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18097861/paranoid-putin-living-top-secret-nuke-bunkers-nuclear-war/\">complete isolation</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He alleged that the warlord now opts to stay &#8220;in his bunker&#8221; rather than make trips like he used to &#8211; fuelling rumours that <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21809587/video-proving-putin-uses-body-doubles-goes-viral/\">the 70-year-old sends body doubles in his place</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin has placed himself on &#8220;lockdown&#8221; to minimise the risk of his potential execution and in the hopes of fending off <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/\">Covid</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov&#8217;s bombshell revelations were published by Dossier independent media, who claim he is the highest-ranking defector so far from Putin’s immediate security circle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The engineer was in the presidential communications directorate and reportedly had access to Putin’s personal communications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has now urged the Russian people to wake up and realise that the President &#8220;has lost touch with the world&#8221; while hiding away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov said: &#8220;He has been living in an information cocoon for the past couple of years, spending most of his time in his residences, which the media very fittingly call bunkers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life.&nbsp;He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He only values his own life and the lives of his family and friends.&nbsp;The lives of your family and friends are of no interest to him.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former protection officer, who worked directly under Putin, claims he witnessed the despot&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17990548/inside-putins-paranoid-world/\">descent into paranoia</a> firsthand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained: &#8220;I can tell you that I went on many business trips with him, and he went on many trips before 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;After that, he stayed in his bunker and maybe made just one, maximum, three business trips a year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claims the Russian leader is so convinced that the West are infiltrating his communications that he takes a special box with him on foreign trips to prevent his secret talks from leaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This box always travels abroad along with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21253237/putin-nuclear-briefcase-armageddon-taunt-to-west/\">Putin’s nuclear suitcase</a> which he can use to unleash atomic war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov said: &#8220;The President also has a telephone booth we take on every foreign trip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is a place from which you can conduct talks with guaranteed confidentiality.&nbsp;The booth is, of course, bulky. It is a cube about 2.5 meters high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>STEALTH MODE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Inside there is a workstation and a telephone, which one can use to talk without fear of these conversations being overheard or read by foreign intelligence.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kremlin have already <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21781196/paranoid-putin-bans-iphones-russian-government-officials/\">banned iPhones amid fears they can be hacked by CIA and GCHQ spies</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov said: &#8220;I mean, in all my years of service, I haven’t seen him once with a mobile phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With Putin…he doesn’t use the internet or a mobile phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He only receives information from his closest circle, which means that he lives in an information vacuum.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The engineer had previously installed special communications links for Putin in his planes, helicopters, yachts and armoured train.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But instead of arriving in style, the President is now increasingly using the train &#8220;because it is less conspicuous&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Planes show up on certain [databases],&#8221; Karakulov said. &#8220;Whereas a train, how many of these grey trains are there?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most importantly, they cannot be tracked on any information resource.&nbsp;It’s done for stealth purposes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He alleged that Putin heavily relies on his close-knit circle of FSO guards, headed by his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19660331/putin-grips-desk-amid-rumour-he-has-parkinsons/\">loyal henchman Viktor Zolotov</a>, for updates on the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;SELF-ISOLATING PRESIDENT&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They reportedly &#8220;call him the Boss, worship him in every way and only ever talk of him in those terms&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this means the warlord&#8217;s knowledge of events is filtered via the secret services &#8211; and what he watches on state-controlled Russian TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who come in close proximity to Putin to fill his ear must self-quarantine for two weeks, Karakulov claimed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that his former boss is &#8220;mortally afraid” of Covid and is <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18641455/putins-bunker-food-tasters-checking-poison-fears-assassination/\">isolating himself</a> for the fourth year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet he says the dictator appears in good health for a 70-year-old, testimony which possibly contradicts <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21923861/putins-health-stomach-pains-isnt-eating/\">repeated claims that he is ailing</a> &#8211; although it is unclear the captain had access to Putin’s health secrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov continued: &#8220;We still have a self-isolating President.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have to observe a strict quarantine for two weeks before any event, even those lasting 15 to 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is a pool of employees who have been cleared – who underwent this two-week quarantine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They are [considered] ‘clean’ and can work in the same room as Putin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Federal Guard Service has a strict no talking shop policy &#8211; and daren&#8217;t discuss rumours regarding Putin&#8217;s alleged terminal illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HEALTH RUMOURS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20160557/putin-parkinsons-pancreatic-cancer-russian-insider-reveals/\">Bombshell spy documents leaked</a>&nbsp;to The Sun appeared to confirm&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a>&nbsp;has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov told Dossier: &#8220;It was not something my colleagues discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If he has any health issues, they must be due to his age. Well, he probably does have them. But it is nothing too serious, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He is in better health than many other people his age. He has annual medical check-ups.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defector seemed remarkably ignorant of Putin’s private life with gymnast <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/\">Alina Kabaeva</a>, 39, and their young children.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he confirmed Putin has a £1 billion <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17394479/putins-pole-dancing-room-black-sea-mansion/\">cliff top palace at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18034192/inside-vladimir-putin-superyacht-scheherazade/\">private yacht Scheherazade</a>, as earlier revealed by Russia’s independent media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karakulov called on his fellow officers to come forward with evidence to out Putin as a &#8220;war criminal&#8221; and stop &#8220;the genocide of the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukrainian</a> people&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a heartfelt appeal, he said: &#8220;You have information that is not broadcast on television.&nbsp;I have only seen a tiny part of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Come forward, support me [with more evidence].&nbsp;You will help our citizens to learn the truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am sure that you had questions about the Commander-in-Chief’s actions before, but the oath forced you not to ask [them] and to smoothly execute his orders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t<blockquote class=\"article__quote\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color\">\n\t\t\t<p>You mustn’t follow criminal orders and serve this war criminal, Vladimir Putin.

windows and blew up the dryer[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The explosion launched a ball of fire across the building and straight into the spot where he had just been standing after bagging up his clean washing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fireball was so strong it smashed all the windows of the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/\">Spanish </a>laundrette, and even ripped the front door off its hinges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The building, on the ground floor of a three-storey block, is at the entrance to an industrial estate in the Galician city of La Coruna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators have concluded the blast was caused by the overheating of flammable fuel in a cigarette lighter which had been left inside a trouser pocket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shocking footage showed the door of the tumble dryer being blown open before the premises turned a bright orange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debris was also seen left on the ground inside and outside the laundrette in the wake of the blast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is understood no-one else was inside at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident occurred around 8pm on March 14 but the video of the blast has only just been made public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports at the time, before the footage emerged, said police and firefighters were among the emergency responders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire crews are said to have torn down the damaged facade because of a crack in the plaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A witness told a local paper the day after the blast: “We heard a loud noise but it didn’t sound like an explosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We didn’t think more of it until about ten minutes later the sirens of fire engines began to sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I went outside and found the whole corner of the street destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The firefighters tore the front wall outside down because there was a crack in it and felt there was a risk it could collapse.”</p>"},{"title":"Massive avalanche kills seven and leaves 150 trapped after

explosion[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Now new video has emerged showing the pro-<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a> propagandist, 40, engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, 26-year-old <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/\">Daria Trepova, who was arrested on Monday for Tatarsky&#8217;s murder</a>, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former art student appears to be trying to edge out of the room &#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the cafe &#8211; perhaps to shield herself &#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Trepova was officially charged with committing a &#8220;terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tatarsky was the only person killed in the blast, which injured some 30 people, leaving ten in a critical condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn&#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further distressing footage purports to show the exact moment the bomb &#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the cafe moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as pro-Putin media rushes to finger Trepova for the murder of Tatarsky, a day after she was arrested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian cops are also hunting for the maker of the statuette, which was filled with TNT explosives before being delivered by Trepova.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has claimed she was framed for the killing, although she is believed to have lied about her name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the clip taken seconds before Tatarsky&#8217;s death, he is heard calling her &#8220;Nasty&#8221; (Anastasia) as he opens the package she had given him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It purportedly showed the military blogger on the frontline in the war in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He asks her to sit near him, to which she replies: &#8220;I am too shy,&#8221; before taking a seat in a chair away to the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tatarsky &#8211; real name Maxim Fomin &#8211; then examines the gold-coloured statuette, exclaiming: &#8220;Oh wow! What a beautiful lad, is it me? Let&#8217;s take it out&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appearing pleased, he goes on: &#8220;A golden Vladlen, perfect,&#8221; before joking: &#8220;Thank god, I am much better looking.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he places the statuette back in its packaging, it explodes, killing Tatarsky instantly.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t<blockquote

point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some claim that he was killed by anti-war protesters, others allege that this may have been an attack in retaliation for his criticism of Putin&#8217;s generals and the way they had fought in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third group has said that the bombing may have been a false flag operation to pin the blame on suspected opposition groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danilo delle Fave, military and intelligence analyst for ITSS Verona, told The Sun Online: &#8220;The current Russian leadership has used false flags on several occasions to increase the support to the government.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He pointed to the 1999 apartment bombings which were pinned on Chechen terrorists and helped to catapult the then-unknown Putin to power the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a targeted attack could then be used to spur support for the stalling <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;We see that the current mobilization effort is sluggish, an attack in the heart of the Russian Federation could be used to influence people to join the army.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A false flag is therefore a credible hypothesis.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delle Fave went on: &#8220;The way in which the attack has been conducted &#8211; a bomb inside a statue &#8211; suggests that the plotters are probably a small group.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the attack lacked the sophistication and planning of the assassination which killed the daughter of pro-Putin figure Alexander Dugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delle Fave said that a third theory was that this was the result of infighting between the Russian security establishment and the hardliners such as Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations such as the Wagner Group have long called for a far more extreme approach to the conflict, and have slammed the perceived caution of Russia&#8217;s generals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;I think that only time will tell which of these three hypotheses is the correct one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In any case, we should expect an increase in these kinds of events, since the Russians are unable to achieve their objectives in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>"},{"title":"Netherlands train crash: At least one dead and dozens injured in horror

to 50 people on board were trapped in the darkness in overturned carriages after the train slammed into construction equipment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was travelling to The Hague from Leiden when it

most seriously injured were rushed to nearby hospitals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The death toll and severity of injuries sustained was not immediately clear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One witness described the moment of sheer terror as people were left scrambling in the darkness when the train crashed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unidentified traveller told the local Omroep West television news channel: &#8220;We heard a loud bang and suddenly the lights went out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We couldn’t initially get out of the train because there was no electricity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some images of the wreckage show a string of broken windows in the carriages, although it is unclear if this was caused by the crash or passengers&#8217; escape attempts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte paid tribute to the

video</a> showing the blonde, with cropped hair, admitting her role in the bomb plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, footage released by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation shows the moment Tryopova entered an apartment building with a large suitcase and shoulder bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She can be seen smiling as a man opens a door for her, before the video cuts to show her arrest by Russian police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cops said she travelled around the city by taxi for four hours before arriving at the apartment block, Russian media reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local newspaper Izvestia claims that Tryopova bought a ticket from Pulkovo airport &#8211; but never arrived for her flight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/\">Russia</a> released a supposed confession video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked to explain why she is being detained, Tryopova says: &#8220;I&#8217;d put it this way, for being at the assassination side of Vladlen Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I brought there the statuette that exploded.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was then pressed to reveal who supplied her with the devastating explosive, to which she replied: &#8220;Can I tell you later?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova is alleged to have posed as an admirer while attending the creative event, while carrying the explosive in a cardboard box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CCTV footage captured a suspect strolling past the café clutching the package, before entering the venue owned by mercenary warlord <a

of the brutal <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/\">Wagner Group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a cruel twist of fate, eyewitnesses claim Tatarsky effectively <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21925611/putin-blogger-signed-own-death-warrant-blown-up-statue/\">signed his own death warrant</a> by welcoming Tryopova and her lethal gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security at the café had questioned the blonde upon her arrival and told her to leave the box at the door after they asked: &#8220;What if it&#8217;s a bomb?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova is alleged to have described herself as an &#8220;artist&#8221; and explained she &#8220;wanted to show the heroes of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/\">Putin&#8217;s special military operation&#8221;</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is claimed that she struck up a conversation with the popular blogger before retrieving the package from a coat cupboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One attendee claimed the suspect had used the fake name Nastya to get close to Tatarsky before handing him the TNT-laced statue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video captured the moment she handed the box to Tatarsky, who held it approvingly before placing it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alisa Smotrova said the pro-Kremlin pundit had insisted on seeing the bust, despite concerns from security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing the encounter she claims to have witnessed, she told&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kp.ru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KP.ru</a>&nbsp;that Tatarsky had asked his alleged killer&#8217;s name during the seminar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alisa explained: &#8220;She said: ‘Nastya. I want to give you a sculpture because I study at the sculpture department at the Academy of Art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He said: ‘Well, fetch it.’ She said: ‘They told me at the entrance, &#8216;What if it&#8217;s a bomb? So I left it there’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well, everyone here laughed. She said: ‘Well, shall I bring it?’ He said: ‘Yes, bring it’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She came, brought this box and went to the stage. She gave it to him.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bystander claimed that Tryopova then became reluctant to engage with him and sit closer after he invited her to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alisa continued: &#8220;She says: ‘Oh, I&#8217;m so shy’. He said: ‘Sit closer’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She sat closer to the window, and said: ‘Well, I&#8217;m here on the chair’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They took out the sculpture, it&#8217;s a golden head in a helmet. Well, I don&#8217;t even know if it looks like Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He put it down there without a second thought and then continued asking questions [to his seminar audience].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And suddenly an explosion and smoke… We were sitting in the second part of the hall. Everyone ran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Those nearby, of course, were already covered in blood and ran away. The windows exploded too. We ran to the exit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just three minutes after the exchange, Tatarsky was dead after the statue that contained up to 450 grams of TNT erupted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police told RBC media that “the explosion was at a height of 60 centimetres from the floor.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its capacity was 300 to 450 grams of TNT and it went off &#8220;to the right of Tatarsky.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova is said to have fled the scene and was reportedly booked on a flight from Pulkovo&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/airports/\">Airport</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;hours later &#8211; but never showed up for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fireball explosion tore through the café, injuring 30 and sending shards of glass blasting into the street.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage of the aftermath shows people attending to bleeding victims outside the façade of the collapsed café.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State media said 19 of the 30 caught in the St Petersburg blast were taken to hospital. Eight people remain in a serious condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova was busted at a rented flat close to the scene on Monday by the FSB and Investigative Committee, according to local media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As she was led away in handcuffs from the residential complex, she reportedly said: &#8220;I was set up. I was just being used.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first picture of Tryopova after her arrest showed her with cropped blond hair, suggesting she had cut it to disguise herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cops are still hunting her alleged&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>-born accomplice Maria Yarun, 40, although&nbsp;some reports say she is in hospital after the blast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials are now said to be scouring through Tryopova&#8217;s conversations in a private web chat, according to&nbsp;Telegram channel VCK-OGPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The messages reportedly suggested she had come to St Petersburg from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a>&nbsp;late last week and intended to fly abroad &#8211; to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/\">Istanbul</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former shop worker had breakfast with her friend on Sunday and sent her a message following the explosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova wrote: &#8220;I could have died there, I&#8217;d rather have died there, I was set up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21926366\" class=\"wp-caption

volition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, with Daria we really do not support the war in Ukraine, but we believe that such actions are unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am 100 percent sure that she would never have agreed to such a thing if she had known.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, is one of Russia&#8217;s foremost military bloggers and has over 560,000 followers on Telegram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He provided a critical running commentary on Russia&#8217;s war in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine&nbsp;</a>and had once been a

I want to give you a sculpture because I study at the sculpture department at the Academy of Art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He said: ‘Well, fetch it.’ She said: ‘They told me at the entrance, &#8216;What if it&#8217;s a bomb?

He said: ‘Sit closer’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She sat closer to the window, and said: ‘Well, I&#8217;m here on the chair’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They took out the sculpture, it&#8217;s a golden head in a helmet. Well, I don&#8217;t even know if it looks like Tatarsky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He put it down there without a second thought and then continued asking questions [to his seminar audience].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And suddenly an explosion and smoke… We were sitting in the second part of the hall.

still hunting her alleged&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>-born accomplice Maria Yarun, 40, although&nbsp;some reports say she is in hospital after the blast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials are now said to be scouring through Tryopova&#8217;s conversations in a private web chat, according to&nbsp;Telegram channel VCK-OGPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The messages reportedly suggested she had come to St Petersburg from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/\">Moscow</a>&nbsp;late last week and intended to fly abroad &#8211; to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/\">Istanbul</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former shop worker had breakfast with her friend on Sunday and sent her a message following the

messenger account for the first time in seven years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tryopova&#8217;s boyfriend Dmitry Rylov &#8211; also in his 20s and a member of the so-called Russian Liberation Army &#8211; insists

is one of Russia&#8217;s foremost military bloggers and has over 560,000 followers on Telegram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He provided a critical running commentary on Russia&#8217;s war in <a

previously appeared to confirm the dictator has pancreatic cancer and early-stage&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/\">Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has now been claimed the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia\">Russian</a> leader has suffered a setback in his health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telegram channel General SVR&nbsp;&#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &#8211; has been pumping out unverified information since the start of the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The channel today claimed: &#8220;Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/\">Putin</a>&#8216;s health worsened. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He practically ate nothing and periodically complained of pain in the abdomen, coming bouts of nausea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;After taking the medicine, for a while, the symptoms disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Putin, although he spends time at the residence on weekends, is almost constantly in bunker-type premises, fearing possible air strikes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The despot today look puffy-faced as he held a meeting with Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He could be seen fidgeting before clinging to the table as they spoke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political analyst Valery Solovey last week alleged <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21898070/putin-high-speed-treated-cancer-neurological-issues/\">Putin is &#8220;high on speed&#8221; during key meetings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claims the president is undergoing treatment for cancer and neurological issues from both Israeli and Chinese doctors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solovey &#8211; whose earlier claims about the Kremlin leader&#8217;s poor&nbsp;health&nbsp;were denied &#8211; claims the tyrant has resorted to &#8220;very strong stimulants” amid significant weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, General SVR previously claimed fresh treatment Putin had started <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21450252/putin-health-relapse-lash-out-ukraine/\">could make him lash out</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also reported the panicked dictator had <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21382442/putin-classifies-medical-files-cancer-battle/\">dramatically classified bombshell data</a> that appeared to prove he had been treated for cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to a former CIA chief, Putin &#8211; reported health problems aside &#8211; is a dead man walking and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21882127/putin-dead-man-walking-killed-cia-chief/\">could be killed to finally end the war</a> in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Olson, the spy agency&#8217;s former chief of counterintelligence, said he believes the sharks are now circling for the tyrant back home in&nbsp;Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olson told The Sun that&nbsp;Putin&nbsp;is now in a &#8220;no win&#8221; situation &#8211; with the war either devolving into a grinding stalemate, or ending with Vlad&#8217;s death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said if Putin stays in power he will never give up the war &#8211; and so the way to end it is for Vlad to be killed or ousted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olson, who served for over 30 years in the CIA and won medals for his service, explained that things don&#8217;t look good for Putin &#8211; with either his oligarch pals, his military, or even his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21444569/putin-new-soviet-union-coup/\">people set to turn on him</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putin has lost more than 170,000 soldiers, according to&nbsp;<a

as the sexy clip racked up nearly 27million views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HardWoodBunny filmed herself laying the framework for some outdoor decking in the sunshine while donning a sports bra and tight gym

trolls who said she &#8220;return to modelling&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I literally have a full time woodworking business,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I own Stain and Ink and have built everything

</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah has been in the industry for four years, but still can&#8217;t escape the constant interrogations from people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She explained that male carpenters will assume that she needs help at work and will say to her: “I’ll pick this up for your sweetheart.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this, Sarah claimed that many men on-site will ask “whose wife is this?” when they see her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, she doesn&#8217;t let the uncomfortable comments get her down, because they drive her to do better than blokes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21925295\"

What would it be like to have&nbsp;sex&nbsp;with an alien?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very curious about experiencing all things that I can in this life, so.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the no holds barred chat, she said &#8220;there&#8217;s not a line that I draw&#8221; in terms of sex-periences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/\">Aussie</a> has already had her fair share of wacky adventures during her illustrious career &#8211; including camming for identical twins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela told how she was performing for the two blokes separately without realising their likeness &#8211; until one of them brought his brother in the room during an online chat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continued: &#8220;We had a situationship, it wasn’t just sex. He was a fan. OK, there was a timespan. We were really into each other and we were ongoing for a while, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Then, eventually that all broke down and then – here’s the funny part of the story – I was camming with his identical brother at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They knew because at one point twin one was like &#8216;I have a surprise for me&#8217; and he brought twin two in and said &#8216;come in here&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was like [shocked].&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The porn star also took the opportunity to clarify rumours surrounding another sticky situation she found herself in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/porn/\">sex industry</a>&nbsp;veteran&nbsp;Kieran Lee <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21344487/porn-star-angela-white-nearly-died-sex-keiran-lee/\">claimed to have &#8220;almost killed&#8221;

after a tentacle emerged from a hole in the ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;I just thought it had algae or something like that on it but then a tentacle popped out,&#8221; he told NCA NewsWire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The horrified man instantly dropped the ball but was left scrambling after his dog, Otto, when he started chasing the toy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As soon as that tentacle came out, I knew there was only one creature it could be,&#8221;

Any suggestions otherwise are false. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;His sole purpose in his work is to capture issues occurring around the world and to shed light on them so that the public can make informed decisions about how to navigate the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We continue to call for his immediate release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The unjust arrest of one of our own sits heavy with all of us, and I know for many there are lingering questions about what the Russian government’s actions mean for freedom of the press in the region.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After relocating to Russia, Gershkovich won awards for his work at The Moscow Times before joining the Agence France-Presse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After joining WSJ early in 2022, he travelled to the Belarus-Ukraine border as Russia invaded Ukraine, making him the only US reporter who could see the first injured Russian forces being taken home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21921581\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wall-street-journal-journalist-evan-807329276.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21921581\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Gershkovich joined the WSJ in 2022[/caption]"},{"title":"Seven burn to death in fireball crash after ‘drunk’ driver ploughs into two cars on German motorway","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21922151/death-motorway-drunk-driver-crashes-germany/","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Apr 2023 10:13:30 +0000","dc:creator":{"#cdata-section":"Katie Davis"},"category":[{"#cdata-section":"News"},{"#cdata-section":"World News"},{"#cdata-section":"Police"}],"guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"Post 21922151 at The Sun"},"description":{"#cdata-section":""},"content:encoded":"<p>SEVEN people have been killed after their cars went up in flames when a suspected drunk driver ploughed into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police the motorist who caused the horror pile-up on a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/\">German</a> motorway did not have a licence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21922244\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-shows-tragic-accident-undated-807556037-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922244\" width=\"960\" height=\"541\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Seven people have died in a motorway pile-up in Germany[/caption]\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_21922430\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-shows-tragic-accident-undated-807556156.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922430\" width=\"960\" height=\"537\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Police are investigating the horror crash[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Five 19-year-olds were travelling in a Mercedes on Saturday when a BMW trying to overtake another car drifted over to the wrong side of  the B247 motorway in the central state of Thuringia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All five, three men and two women, were killed after their car then caught on fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BMW is then understood to have hit a Volkswagen Caddy, causing it to also burst into flames and kill the 60-year-old driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 73-year-old passenger in the VW managed to pull themselves out of the burning car and survived, according to local media, while a 44-year-old passenger in the BMW also died in the crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police named the BMW driver only as 45-year-old Ronny L., due to strict local privacy laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is in hospital with a second passenger from the car, aged 34, and both in serious condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authorities are investigating Ronny L. for negligent homicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police spokeswoman Fraenze Toepfer said: &#8220;We also suspect that the BMW driver was drunk and have ordered a blood test.
