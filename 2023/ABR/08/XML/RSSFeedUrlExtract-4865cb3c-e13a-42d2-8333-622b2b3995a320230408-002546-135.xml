<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published seven advisories this week covering vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software from multiple vendors. Some of the flaws are rated critical and two of them already have public exploits.</p><p>The impacted products include:</p><ul>
<li>Scadaflex II controllers made by Industrial Control Links</li>
<li>Screen Creator Advance 2 and Kostac PLC programming software from JTEKT Electronics</li>
<li>Korenix JetWave industrial wireless access points and communications gateways</li>
<li>Hitachi Energy's MicroSCADA System Data Manager SDM600</li>
<li>mySCADA myPRO software</li>
<li>Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<p>ScadaFlex II series controllers are what's known in the industry as packaged controllers, stand-alone systems that are built with custom software, processing power and I/O capabilities for controlling and monitoring other industrial processes. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-096-01" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">According to CISA</a>, multiple versions of the software running on the SC-1 and SC-2 controllers are impacted by a critical vulnerability -- CVE-2022-25359 with CVSS score 9.1 -- that could allow unauthenticated attackers to overwrite, delete, or create files on the system.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3693088/cisa-warns-of-critical-flaws-in-ics-and-scada-software-from-multiple-vendors.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Uncertainty and instability marked the end of 2022 for many in the tech sector, a trend that bled into the beginning of 2023.

<p>Developers of ThingsBoard, an open-source platform for managing IoT devices that's used in various industry sectors, have fixed a vulnerability that could allow attackers to escalate their privileges on a server and send requests with administrative privileges. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-26462, was discovered and privately reported by researchers from IBM Security X-Force. It stems from the platform using a static key to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued to clients. With knowledge of that key, which can be easily obtained, attackers could forge valid requests that would allow them to identify to the system as higher privileged users.</p><p>"Because ThingsBoard allowed the default key to be used without requiring administrators to change it, and because that default key was also exposed publicly in the configuration files, the door was opened for attackers to gain unauthorized access in excess of what is intended," the X-Force researchers said in <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/x-force-identifies-vulnerability-iot-platform/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">their report</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692818/default-static-key-in-thingsboard-iot-platform-can-give-attackers-admin-access.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>When I asked CISOs about their cyber threat intelligence (CTI) programs about five years ago, I got two distinct responses. Large, well-resourced enterprises were investing their threat intelligence programs with the goal of better operationalizing it for tactical, operational, and strategic purposes. Smaller, resource-constrained and SMB organizations often recognized the value of threat intelligence, but didn’t have the staff, skills, or budgets for investment. For these organizations, threat intelligence programs were nothing more than blocking indicators of compromise (IoCs) with firewalls, endpoint security software, email gateways, or web proxies.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692301/cyber-threat-intelligence-programs-still-crazy-after-all-these-years.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>CISOs are no longer only responsible for the cybersecurity of systems used internally. In many organizations they also focus on securing products and public-facing applications, and one way to do this well is through risk assessment.</p><p>Assessing risk requires identifying baseline security criteria around key elements such as customer contracts and regulatory requirements, Neil Lappage, partner at LeadingEdgeCyber and ISACA member, tells CSO. “From the start, you've got things you’re committed to such as requirements in customer contracts and regulatory requirements and you have to work within those parameters.

On April 1, 2023, that traditional day when technology and social media sites love to pull a fast one on us and engage in often elaborate pranks, the Twitter account for the MITRE ATT&amp;CK platform launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/MITREattack/status/1642167205440749568" rel="nofollow">#attackgpt Twitter bot</a>, which invited users to employ the hashtag #attackgpt, which would generate an “AI” response to questions about the anti-hacker knowledge base.

<p>Multiple attacker groups are using a malicious browser extension for Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera that's aimed at stealing cryptocurrency assets from multiple websites and online wallets. The extension works by injecting rogue code into websites locally in the browser to defeat two-factor authentication and delete automated alerts from mailboxes.</p><p>"Rilide is not the first malware SpiderLabs has observed using malicious browser extensions," researchers from Trustwave SpiderLabs said in <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/rilide-a-new-malicious-browser-extension-for-stealing-cryptocurrencies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a report</a>.

<p>The UK's Information Commissioner’s Office announced today that it has levied a nearly $16 million fine against TikTok for “a number of breaches” of the country’s data protection law.</p><p>Central to the ICO’s decision to fine TikTok are the estimated 1.4 million UK children under 13 years of age, who were allowed to sign up for the platform in 2020, despite the company’s own rules barring such use.</p><p>That’s a violation of UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (similar to the EU's <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3202771/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-requirements-deadlines-and-facts.html">GDPR)</a>, the ICO said in a statement. The UK GDPR requires that companies that use personal data to offer services to children under 13 need a parent or guardian’s permission to do so. The regulator also noted that “senior employees” at TikTok were aware of underage users on the platform, and did not respond adequately to the issue.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692635/uk-fines-tiktok-158-million-for-gdpr-violation-of-childrens-privacy.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) have the potential to introduce significant cybersecurity risks for organizations. M&amp;A teams are generally limited in size and focused on financials and business operations, with IT and cybersecurity taking a back seat early in the process, according to Doug Saylors, partner and co-lead of cybersecurity with global technology research and advisory firm ISG.  “Assumptions about connecting networks, ‘rationalizing’ IT and cybersecurity platforms and staff are generally made with limited knowledge of the actual functions and work performed in each organization,” Saylor says.</p><p>A company merging, being acquired, or undergoing any other M&amp;A activity must be able to evaluate security requirements that could affect the business strategy and risks of the future entity, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3873604" rel="nofollow">a report on cybersecurity in the M&amp;A and due diligence process</a> from Gartner. “This results in an understanding of the state of security in the acquired company (to the extent possible pre-deal) to ensure that there are no rude shocks and in a plan for how to address the integration aspect safely and securely,” the report noted.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692433/5-strategies-to-manage-cybersecurity-risks-in-mergers-and-acquisitions.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>Darktrace has announced a new upgrade to its Darktrace/Email product with enhanced features that defend organizations from evolving cyberthreats including generative AI business email compromise (BEC) and novel social engineering attacks. Among the new capabilities are an AI-employee feedback loop; account takeover protection; insights from endpoint, network, and cloud; and behavioral detections of misdirected emails, the vendor said. The upgrade comes amid growing concern about the ability of generative AI – such as ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) – to <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3685488/how-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-changes-the-phishing-game.html">enhance phishing email attacks</a> and provide an avenue for threat actors to craft more <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3685368/study-shows-attackers-can-use-chatgpt-to-significantly-enhance-phishing-and-bec-scams.html">sophisticated and targeted</a> campaigns at speed and scale.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692450/darktrace-email-upgrade-enhances-generative-ai-email-attack-defense.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>When it comes to threat actors working for the North Korean government, most people have heard of the Lazarus group (APT38). It was responsible for the 2014 attack against Sony Pictures, the 2016 cyber heist of funds belonging to the central bank of Bangladesh, and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware worm. However, another team that security researchers call APT43, Kimsuky, or Thallium has been carrying out cyberespionage and cybercrime operations at the behest of the North Korean government since at least 2018.</p><p>APT43 specializes in credential harvesting and social engineering with a focus on foreign policy and nuclear security issues, topics that align with North Korea’s strategic nuclear goals. The group temporarily pivoted to health-related target verticals in 2021, reflecting the Pyongyang regime's focus at the time on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2022, APT43 has been seen targeting so-called track two diplomatic channels including religious groups, universities, non-governmental organizations, journalists, academics, bloggers, and human rights activists.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3692288/north-korean-threat-actor-apt43-pivots-back-to-strategic-cyberespionage.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
