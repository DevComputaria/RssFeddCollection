        <media:description>Shawn Schweitzer is embraced by an unidentified woman friend in a Hilo, Hawaii Circuit Court, Tuesday, May 9, 2000, following his sentencing by Judge Rikki May Amano. Schweitzer, the brother of a Hawaii man who was recently released after more than 20 years in prison for the killing and rape of a tourist, has filed a similar request seeking exoneration. An attorney for the California Innocence Project, which is representing Shawn Schweitzer, filed a similar petition Thursday, April 6, 2023, outlining the same evidence.</media:description>

        <media:description>In this June 14, 2016, file photo, two people walk on the University of Wyoming campus in Laramie, Wyo. Seven women who have sued to challenge the admission of a transgender woman to their sorority at the University of Wyoming can't remain anonymous in court, a judge has ruled in a case highlighting tension over belonging for transgender people in the least-populated state. The women must refile their lawsuit with their real names by April 20, U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson in Cheyenne wrote Thursday, April 6, 2023.</media:description>
