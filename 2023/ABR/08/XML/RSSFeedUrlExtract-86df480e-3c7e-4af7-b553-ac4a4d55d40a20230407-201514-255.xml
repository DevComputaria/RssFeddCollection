      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6268874"></div></div><br />

<p>It&#8217;s a Hollywood adage: Video game adaptations don&#8217;t work. <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Hitman, </em><em>Doom</em>, <em>Max Payne</em>&mdash;all flops. But in the last few years, the industry seems to have finally cracked the code on bringing video games to the big screen. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> and <a href="https://time.com/4788898/uncharted-movie-prequel-tom-holland/" ><em>Uncharted</em></a> were pandemic hits. <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is tracking as the biggest movie opening of 2023. And on television, <a href="https://time.com/5762248/witcher-netflix-game/" ><em>The Witcher</em></a> and <a href="https://time.com/6247205/the-last-of-us-hbo-adaptation/" ><em>The Last of Us</em></a> have done blockbuster numbers.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t heap too much praise on Hollywood. The reality is that video games have become so cinematic in their scope, storytelling, and visuals that they&#8217;ve superseded some films in terms of their ambition and emotional resonance. HBO&#8217;s <em>The Last of Us</em> stayed <a href="https://time.com/6260904/the-last-of-us-ending-explained/" >close to its source material</a> exactly because the original game was designed, essentially, as interactive cinema with all the twists and heartbreaks one might expect from a prestige project.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><em>The Last of Us</em> is certainly one of the best video game stories ever created but it&#8217;s not unique. Other adventure games such as <em>God of War</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn, </em>and <i>Bioshock</i> explore philosophical themes and test the player&#8217;s ethical boundaries.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the success of video game adaptations, studios are now jockeying for the next <em>Last of Us</em> level hit. It&#8217;s an obvious place for expansion, considering video games have now overtaken films in the market. Across the world, people spent $184.4 billion on gaming in 2022, dwarfing the total global revenue of $26 billion at the box office last year. The major gaming studios are now even bigger than movie studios.</p>
<p>Amazon and Netflix have invested especially heavily in future video game adaptations, snapping up the rights to just about every popular game that&#8217;s been released in the last decade&mdash;be they AAA productions or indies. Big names including Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (<em>Westworld</em>), Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Fleabag</em>), and Chad Stahelski (<em>John Wick 4</em>) have all been recruited to figure out how to transform game stories into a more passive medium. Here are 18 video games currently being adapted for film and TV.</p>

<p>The zombie apocalypse is not over yet.<em> The Last of Us</em> adaptation achieved <em>Game of Thrones</em>-level viewership numbers for HBO, so it&#8217;s no surprise that creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are hard at work turning the game&#8217;s sequel, <em>The</em> <em>Last of Us Part II,</em> into two more seasons of television. Without spoiling the show for those who have yet to play the video game, it&#8217;s safe to say that the second season will jump a few years forward in time and reckon with the consequences of Joel&#8217;s decision at the end of season one on his and Ellie&#8217;s relationship.</p>

<p>A beloved video game series about a Spartan warrior named Kratos who challenges first the Greek and then the Nordic gods, <i>God of War </i>took its narrative to the next level in the fourth installment. Nicknamed &#8220;Dad of War,&#8221; the game gave Kratos a vulnerable son named Atreus. The story centered on their tenuous relationship after the death of Atrues&#8217; mother Faye and the journey they take together to spread her ashes from the highest peak in the Nine Realms. The fifth game, <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, became the fastest-selling game in PlayStation&#8217;s history. Those new Amazon series will be adapted from those two entries in the franchise.</p>

Parentless and banned from her tribe as a child, Aloy unwinds the mysteries of the past and her planet while contending with a mysterious, all-knowing figure named Sylens (voiced by the late, great Lance Reddick). Netflix has announced that Steve Blackman, showrunner of <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>, will helm the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> series.</p>

<p>Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan of <em>Westworld</em> fame are writing an original story set in the world of <em>Fallout</em>. The long-running video game series, set in a dieselpunk wasteland decimated by a nuclear bomb, has hopped around to different time periods and locations across America in its decades-long run, and it&#8217;s unclear where and when Joy and Nolan have chosen to set their series. But we will definitely see ghouls, humans whose exposure to nuclear radiation has melted their flesh but given them inhuman longevity. The cast includes Walton Goggins of <em>Justified</em>, Kyle MacLachlan of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and Ella Purnell of <em>Yellowjackets</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> on Amazon Prime (TBA)</h2>

<p><em>Fleabag</em> writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge has signed on to reboot the <em>Tomb Raider </em>franchise&mdash;again. Angelina Jolie starred as the British aristrocrat-turned-treasure hunter back in 2001, and Alicia Vikander took over the role in 2018. None of the Lara Croft films have exactly gone down in history as masterpieces of cinema. But she&#8217;s a complex character. While arguably the first female video game character to break out into the mainstream, she originally she existed largely to be ogled. Lara thankfully got a makeover in the games in the 2010s: She now has a more realistic body as well as a complex backstory. Waller-Bridge may bring her wry sense of humor to the tale and send up the character&#8217;s complex history.</p>

<p>A 2016 <a href="https://time.com/4605625/review-assassins-creed-movie/" ><em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> film</a> starring Michael Fassbender faltered at the box office. But now Netflix is hoping it can wring several different series out of the franchise, making both live-action and anime adaptations. The plot of the Assassin&#8217;s Creed games gets complicated quickly and involves a millennia-long struggle between a group called the Order of Assassins and the Knights Templar. The important part to remember is each game is set in a different place and time period&mdash;Renaissance Italy, the American Revolution, Ancient Egypt&mdash;and begs a for a historically-minded globe-trotting show massive in its size and scale.</p>

<p>An adaptation of the sci-fi-horror franchise <em>Bioshock</em> has been in development hell for years. Set across multiple post-apocalyptic landscapes, including an underwater city and a floating one, <em>Bioshock </em>is at its heart a critique of American exceptionalism, which has warped the world of <em>Bioshock</em> into a hellscape. At one point, <em>Pirates of the Carribean </em>director Gore Verbinski was attached to the project. But now Netflix has hired a dream team of <em>Hunger Games</em> director Franchis Lawrence <em>Blade Runner 2049 </em>writer Michael Green to finally bring the film to the big screen.</p>
<h2><em>Disco Elysium</em> on Amazon Prime (TBA)</h2>

<p>This indie gem follows a detective trying to solve a case while struggling with drug-induced amnesia in politically volatile city. The game depends heavily on the choices you make for your character: You can choose to be a fascist, a communist, a moralist, or an ultraliberal; a drug addict or a recovering addict; a thinker or a brawler. Your interactions with people in the game change depending on your decisions, but whatever you choose you&#8217;re bound to have fascinating and sometimes disturbing philosophical debates. It will certainly be a challenge for a showrunner will figure out how to adapt the fungible yet consistently despicable character to the television format.</p>

<p><a href="https://time.com/6264916/john-wick-chapter-4-franchise-future/" ><em>John Wick 4 </em></a>director Chad Stahelski is adapting <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> into a feature film. Set in 1274, the game centers around Jin Sakai, a samurai tasked with protecting the island of Tsushima during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. In order to contend with the threat, Jin Sakai has to choose between the honorable samurai teachings and violating his ethical bounds in order to save his homeland. Stahelski is sure to bring the incredible stunt choreography and camerawork he&#8217;s deployed on the <em>Wick</em> movies to the world of 13th century Japan.</p>

<p>Another adaptation from the <em>John Wick</em> team: Derek Kolstad, who wrote the original <em>John Wick</em> movie, has signed on to adapt <em>Sifu</em>. In the game, the player plays a kung-fu master on a mission of revenge. Every time the player dies in the game, the character returns having aged but also learned a new level of skills. The player moves through the game, at first as a young student and eventually grows into an old master. It&#8217;s a concept that will certainly be challenging to capture onscreen, whether it involves CGI-aging a single actor or casting multiple actors to plain the main character.</p>

<p>A lot of the video game adaptations are genre works that will require effects-heavy productions. But <em>Life Is Strange</em> is set in our world, though the main character in the first game Max Caulfield discovers she has the ability to rewind time. The game explores the butterfly effect of Max&#8217;s actions, allowing the player to move back in time and change the narrative.

<p>Oscar Isaac is attached to play Solid Snake, the star of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> action series. Hideo Kojima&#8217;s massive, convoluted series revolves around a special ops soldier (Solid Snake) who goes on various anti-terrorist missions. The story spans decades and involves secret organizations, the Kennedy assassination, and revenge plots. Isaac said in 2022 that the producers are still trying to crack the plot to the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> film.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 27, a Rhode Island high schooler </span><a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/swatting-calls-unfounded-hoax-rhode-island-schools-cranston-high-school-east-chariho-narragansett-north-kingstown-westerly-march-27-2023"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stood on a toilet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and watched as a police officer, gun drawn, searched the bathroom for an active shooter.</span> <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/schools/2023/03/31/swatting-massachusetts-schools-hoax-active-shooter-calls-police-solutions/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 28</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Massachusetts, a school nurse locked people into her darkened office, where they cried and prayed as they waited for 20 minutes. And on </span><a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/reported-school-shootings-in-western-pa-are-false-officials-say/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 29</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Pennsylvania high schooler sent a text to his family, &ldquo;I love you all. There is an active shooter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these incidents occurred across the country, they each had something in common: the danger was a hoax. A caller had contacted the school community and lied, claiming there was an active shooter.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last several weeks, dozens of these calls have flooded schools across the country, including 50 school districts in New York state </span><a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-kathy-hochul-latest-school-swatting-threats"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on April 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 28 communities in Massachusetts </span><a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/multiple-mass-schools-received-swatting-hoax-threats-tuesday-state-police-say/3007871/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on March 28</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 12 in Wyoming on </span><a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/in_our_schools/south-high-one-of-at-least-a-dozen-schools-hit-with-false-shooting-reports/article_99bc2738-d23d-11ed-aa74-c7b2fb2fd81d.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nine Missouri schools </span><a href="https://www.komu.com/news/state/officials-investigate-series-of-swatting-calls-at-missouri-schools/article_5ea28a76-cce2-11ed-8cd3-bb4bfd501357.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on March 27</span></a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and at least 30 in Iowa on </span><a href="https://www.kwwl.com/news/iowa-city/swatting-calls-reported-across-several-iowa-counties-on-tuesday-morning/article_f892e280-c7fa-11ed-a753-77e7c19d9fdf.html"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Over the last two years, such cons&mdash;which are <a href="https://time.com/5082806/what-is-swatting-tyler-barriss-troy-livingston/" >sometimes called &ldquo;swatting&rdquo;</a> in a reference to the &#8220;SWAT teams&#8221; of heavily armed police that respond to active shooter incidents&mdash;have terrorized hundreds of American schools, often in groups of schools on the same day in a particular state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the last few weeks have seen a particularly heavy volume of these calls. The trouble is that current phone technology makes it easy for almost anyone to obtain a phone number anonymously. That makes it extremely difficult for police to track down the source of the calls and hold the callers accountable. </span></p>
<h2><b>How many hoax calls have there been to schools?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI has not released an estimate of how many schools have received phone calls reporting fake shootings. However, local news organizations have reported incidents at schools across the country over the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Klinger of the </span><a href="https://eschoolsafety.org/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educator&rsquo;s School Safety Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit that focuses on school safety, has recorded 384 false shooting reports to schools from the beginning of this school year through the end of March, up from 69 false reports in the 2018-2019 school year (the last year they have complete data). The National Association of School Resource Officers documented hoax calls in 42 states since September as of April 6. However, some schools may have been left off both lists if they weren&rsquo;t reported in local news. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why are there more fake calls now?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI said in a statement to TIME on Tuesday that it is &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively investigating these dangerous and criminal threats,&rdquo; although it has &ldquo;no information to indicate a specific and credible threat at this tim</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.&rdquo; In November, it said that the calls may be coming from outside the U.S., the AP</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-race-and-ethnicity-government-politics-cea91facddabed823513f205073a441f"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure why there are so many calls, especially because technology can make it nearly impossible to identify perpetrators or hold them accountable. What&#8217;s worse, the callers may not even be in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big issue, says Klinger, is that school shootings are a very real threat in the United States, which bad actors can prey upon. &ldquo;It makes sense. <a href="https://time.com/6182235/mass-shootings-children-mental-health-anxiety-depression/" >We&#8217;re scared of school shootings</a>, because they happen,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And so it is a thing that people can use against us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has also made it easier for people to conceal their identities, says Fred Posner, a communications consultant for LOD Communications, a technical consulting company. In the last few years, he says, VPNs (virtual private networks) became cheaper and more common, which makes it easy to conceal your identity. Layered on top of that, he says, phone carriers can now provide phone numbers to anyone, anywhere if they have an internet connection. Without inputting so much as a credit card, ID or even real name, he says, people can make digital phone calls from anywhere&mdash;even another country, he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1129919258/swatting-fake-school-shooter-calls-hoax-pattern"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that the carrier TextNow was used to make at least some of the fake calls to schools this fall. The calls appear to have originated from Ethiopia, the NPR report found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For law enforcement, tracking phone calls through such companies is &ldquo;almost impossible,&rdquo; Posner says.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why swatting is so dangerous</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swatting can be terrifying for the children, teachers and parents, who rightfully fear for their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threat may also place everyone involved <a href="https://time.com/5101997/tyler-barriss-swatting-manslaughter-charge/" >in physical danger</a>. If they anticipate that there&rsquo;s an active shooter at a school, emergency responders may speed to the scene&mdash;and, guns at their sides, may rush into a school expecting to see an active shooter. On Monday, for instance, Harvard University campus police allegedly pointed assault rifles at four students, who are Black, after a hoax 911 call about an armed person in their suite, the Harvard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson </span></i><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/4/4/lev-swatting-attack/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As hoax calls rise, it&rsquo;s critically important that schools and law enforcement remain ready for a real attack, says Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We still have to respond as if they&#8217;re actually happening,&rdquo; says Canady. &ldquo;We can&#8217;t allow ourselves to go there to think oh, this is another one of those fake calls. That&#8217;s the time when it won&#8217;t be.&rdquo; </span></p>
<h2><b>What can be done to stop fake school threats?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many public comments about swatting, lawmakers and law enforcement emphasized the importance of bringing perpetrators to justice. For instance, after a spate of calls in New York, Senator Chuck Schumer </span><a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2023/04/05/chuck-schumer-announces-plan-to-address-uptick-in-swatting-incidents/70085336007/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a plan for a new FBI team to chase down hoax callers. &ldquo;We need more agents to track down these evil criminals who hide in the darkest corners of the internet,&#8221; Schumer </span><a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/sen-schumer-calls-for-federal-action-following-multiple-swatting-threats"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on April 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how hard it is to trace perpetrators&mdash;and to stop them from wanting to make calls&mdash;Posner argues that a better strategy may be to instead focus on the carriers, like TextNow, to stop enabling people to use their networks with so little verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&#8217;s absolutely no deterrent for them to provide the service to people conducting illegal activities,&rdquo; says Posner. &ldquo;Even the feds, there&#8217;s not a ton that they can do&mdash;unless we get an FTC or Congress that&rsquo;s willing to put some bite into putting carriers somewhat responsible for allowing this type of traffic to cross their networks.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the pastoral back yard of a ranch house in rural Mexico, a grandfather is about to fight his grandson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in one corner of a <a href="https://time.com/4838692/review-netflix-glow-wrestling/" >makeshift wrestling ring</a> is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rel&aacute;mpago Azul </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Blue Lightning), otherwise known as Chava (</span><a href="https://newsfeed.time.com/2012/01/24/demian-bichir-star-of-a-better-life-and-surprise-oscar-nominee/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demi&aacute;n Bichir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), a tough but tender former </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchador</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (wrestler). In the other corner is 13-year-old Alex (Evan Whitten), Chava&rsquo;s American grandson, who is reluctantly spending spring break with his grandfather and cousins on the ranch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex is wearing the mask of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perico Verde</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Green Parakeet), his late father&rsquo;s former </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lucha libre </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Mexican wrestling) persona. His dad&mdash;Chava&rsquo;s son&mdash;recently died of cancer, and Chava can tell that his grandson has yet to fully process the loss. The year is 1996, and Alex has been retreating behind his <a href="https://time.com/4309573/most-influential-gadgets/item/nintendo-gameboy/" >trusty Game Boy</a>.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sad, son,&rdquo; Chava says, trapping Alex in a headlock. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s normal. You&rsquo;re hurt.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hurt,&rdquo; Alex responds. &ldquo;I just really want to be left alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Chava says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK. Let it out, alright? Channel those emotions. Take it all out on me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chava spins around and throws Alex down. &ldquo;Every time your dad gets brought up, you retreat and hide in that stupid game of yours,&rdquo; he says, pinning his grandson to the ground. &ldquo;Face your pain, face your fears and your sorrow. You have to feel the pain of the sadness.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pivotal moment arrives two-thirds of the way through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chupa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fantasy adventure film directed by Jon&aacute;s Cuar&oacute;n (son of Mexican filmmaker </span><a href="https://time.com/collection-post/70897/alfonso-cuaron-2014-time-100/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), coming to Netflix on Friday. A grieving Alex, visiting his family in Mexico, is slowly discovering who he is, with the help of his grandfather&rsquo;s tough love, as he approaches adulthood, Bichir tells TIME. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It seems like he&#8217;s pushing him to do something he doesn&#8217;t want to do, but he&#8217;s only pushing him to face his own fears, and to face his own sadness, and to take it out,&rdquo; Bichir says. &ldquo;We tend to keep many of our feelings to ourselves, unless someone helps you to take it out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his coming-of-age journey, Alex finds Chupa, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chupacabra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cub, on his grandfather&rsquo;s ranch. (A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chupacabra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a mythical creature of Latin American folklore that is said to drink the blood of goats. Chupa himself is more cuddly than terrifying, although his fully-grown family feels more classically scary.) The titular monster cub has been separated from his parent, and becomes a poignant foil for Alex&rsquo;s own loss&mdash;and his gradual realization that, as his mother tells him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your family, and your family&rsquo;s got your back.&rdquo;</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Courtesy of Netflix</span><span class="caption" >Alex (Evan Whitten) and Chupa bond over a music box that plays a song Alex&#8217;s dad used to sing to him.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chupa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wields </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lucha libre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;a beloved Mexican institution full of rivalries, stories, and throughlines&mdash;to build out the narrative that connects Alex and Chava&rsquo;s family. For a spectacle based on physical fighting, wrestling</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">adds a surprising subtext of vulnerability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&#8217;s all based on strength and things that you would actually consider as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">machismo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; Cuar&oacute;n says. &ldquo;But it&#8217;s a sport that plays it with a very interesting tongue in cheek&mdash;from the costumes to a certain levity and comedy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the second Alex crosses the threshold into his grandfather&rsquo;s San Javier home, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lucha libre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is woven into the fabric of the film. On the wall are framed photos of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rel&aacute;mpago Azul</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his glory days. Alex&rsquo;s younger cousin, Memo (Nickolas Verdugo), is obsessed with wrestling, and wears his own </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchador</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costume everywhere. In the hallway stands a mannequin bedecked in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azul&rsquo;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> old mask, cape, and tights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bichir&mdash;a Mexican icon with whom Cuar&oacute;n</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aspired to work&mdash;brought his own personal knowledge and passion for the sport to building</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chava&rsquo;s character. Growing up, his father directed plays with a theater company in Quer&eacute;taro, and the actor recalls going with other families&rsquo; kids to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there. He saw legends like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Rayo de Jalisco</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An&iacute;bal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinieblas el Gigante</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Perro Aguayo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the electric atmosphere stayed with him forever.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Tony Rivetti Jr.&mdash;Netflix</span><span class="caption" >Demi&aacute;n Bichir as the former luchador Chava in &#8216;Chupa.&#8217;</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I noticed that they would change their voice, they would change their attitude, they would change their way of carrying themselves,&rdquo; Bichir says. &ldquo;I wanted that to be a more clear aspect in this character: that he actually becomes somebody else when he&#8217;s in his disguise as a superhero.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because that&rsquo;s what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchadores</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are, he says: Mexican folk superheroes. In the same way that Peter Parker and Spider-Man are two different people, so too are Chava and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rel&aacute;mpago Azul</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When Chava is suited up, he feels like King Kong, Mohammed Lee, or Mick Jagger&mdash;larger than life. Chava accesses different parts of himself through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azul</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just as Bichir does through his characters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&#8217;s when I have been able to do crazy things that I wouldn&#8217;t do as Demi&aacute;n,&rdquo; Bichir says. &ldquo;That&#8217;s probably the most beautiful part of being an actor; that anything is possible, and you&#8217;re capable of doing and saying anything at all. You become free, totally free.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchador</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costumes in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chupa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rel&aacute;mpago Azul&rsquo;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blue sequins, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perico Verde&rsquo;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> green mask, Memo&rsquo;s metallic cape&mdash;were designed by </span><a href="http://www.marianaguerrerodingler.com/about"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana Guerrero Dingler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who worked with legendary </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mascarero</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (mask maker) </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mascarasbucio/?hl=en"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arturo Bucio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to craft the looks. Obsessed with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lucha libre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since childhood, she has amassed a sizable collection of vintage magazines and books on the topic&mdash;many of which provided inspiration when she set out to capture the greatness and nostalgia of Mexican wrestling in the &lsquo;90s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&#8217;s embedded in me,&rdquo; Guerrero Dingler writes in an email. &ldquo;I grew up thinking of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchadores</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Mexican superheroes. Now as an adult there is something about the uniqueness, the history, and the mystique of this world that just speaks to me and inspires me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While watching Bichir work,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuar&oacute;n says, he saw three people: the actor, the grandfather, and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">luchador</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The depth of his masculinity was extra important because, as the director notes, Chava represents the last link to Alex&rsquo;s family mythology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Having grown up in a Mexican family, truly what family does&mdash;besides what the movie says, being there for you&mdash;it also builds a narrative that helps you identify your place in the world,&rdquo; Cuar&oacute;n says. &ldquo;To me, that narrative particularly came from my grandparents.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>As any little girl can tell you, there isn&#8217;t <a href="https://time.com/6149760/mattel-ceo-ynon-kreiz-interview/" >just one Barbie</a>. Sure, when we think of Barbie we often think of the blonde living in Malibu who splits her time between her jobs as an astronaut, President of the United States, and fashionista. But Mattel has released endless variations of Barbie over the years&mdash;and plenty of Kens too.</p>
<p>And Greta Gerwig&#8217;s highly anticipated <a href="https://time.com/5743438/greta-gerwig-little-women-interview/" ><em>Barbie</em> movie</a> is chock-full of Mattel dolls. Margot Robbie is Barbie&#8230;and so is Issa Rae&#8230;and so is Dua Lipa, just to name a few. And Ryan Gosling&#8217;s Ken seems to be competing for Barbie&#8217;s affections with Simu Liu&#8217;s Ken and Kingsley Ben-Adir&#8217;s Ken and other various rivals.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>But Barbieland isn&#8217;t just home to Barbies and Kens. It&#8217;s filled with other, slightly less famous Mattel dolls whose jobs have been largely to double date with Barbie and Ken and, on occasion, share their clothes. When Warner Bros. released the character posters for Gerwig&#8217;s film (out July 21), die-hard doll fans spotted two obscure dolls who were once mired in controversy, Midge and Allan. Played by Emerald Fennell and Michael Cera, Midge and Allan are Barbie and Ken&#8217;s best friends who made headlines after they got pregnant. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Midge&#8217;s origin story</h2>
<div class="time-embed time-embed__twitter" data-provider="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643242415829184514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1643242415829184514%7Ctwgr%5E7a85c633a83fb04fcfbf7490444d61cff82232e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&#038;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fbarbie-movie-cast-posters-real-dolls.html" >

</div>
<p>Midge was introduced in 1963 as Barbie&#8217;s bestie. Apparently, Barbie was <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CLASS/barbie/barb2.html"  target="_blank">getting some heat</a> for being &#8220;too sexy&#8221; at the time, so Midge was designed to be less sensual to combat the criticism&mdash;tough beat for Midge. What exactly made Midge more innocent looking was unclear. She had a rounder face and bangs and wore less eye makeup but otherwise looked pretty much the same as Barbie. In ads, Midge seems to third wheel on Barbie and Ken&#8217;s dates a lot. Again, not great to be Midge.</p>
<p>Midge was retired in the &#8217;60s, but she made a comeback in the &#8217;80s. &#8220;California Dream&#8221; Midge wore a vest and looked like she walked off the set of <em>Saved by the Bell</em>. &#8220;Cool Times&#8221; Midge had voluminous &#8217;80s hair and an electric blue earrings.</p>
<h2>Allan&#8217;s origin story</h2>
<div class="time-embed time-embed__twitter" data-provider="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1643238276877410304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1643238276877410304%7Ctwgr%5E7a85c633a83fb04fcfbf7490444d61cff82232e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&#038;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fbarbie-movie-cast-posters-real-dolls.html" >

</div>
<p>Like Midge, Allan&#8217;s time in the limelight was shortlived. Launched in 1964 as &#8220;Ken&#8217;s buddy&#8221; Allan was around to offer emotional support and play Best Man at Barbie and Ken&#8217;s wedding. The big selling point was the two male dolls could share clothes. Mattel retired Allan after just a few years&mdash;but that&#8217;s marriage for you. Your old friends just sort of fall away.</p>
<h2>Midge and Al(l)an&#8217;s wedding</h2>
<div class="time-embed time-embed__twitter" data-provider="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/LadyHawkins/status/1643706318539182080?s=20" >
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay, I love that we&#39;re all citing the Deep Barbie Lore, but people saying Midge and Alan were discontinued in the 60s, ne&#39;er to return, are discounting my FAVORITE AND MOST PLAYED WITH BARBIE EVER, Wedding Day Midge! <a href="https://t.co/F1DZeY9UqZ"  target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/F1DZeY9UqZ</a></p>

</div>
<p>Midge got married in the &#8217;90s in a Princess Di-esque dress to&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;Allan! Well, actually, she got married to Alan. Mattel dropped one of the Ls in the interning years. Barbie was a bridesmaid, obviously.</p>
<h2>The Midge pregnancy controversy</h2>
<div class="time-embed time-embed__twitter" data-provider="twitter" data-url="https://twitter.com/sinntsn/status/1643335861461975040?s=20" >
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">for those who don&rsquo;t know this Midge is an important part of history, she was sold pregnant and caused a huge controversy because parents were saying she was promoting teen pregnancy <a href="https://t.co/myg7aUnXUr"  target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/myg7aUnXUr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sinn as Todd, Barbie&rsquo;s brother ! (@sinntsn) <a href="https://twitter.com/sinntsn/status/1643335861461975040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"  target="_blank">April 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Then in 2002, Midge got pregnant, which caused a bit of a stir. Technically, this was actually Midge&#8217;s second baby. She and Alan already had a three-year-old boy at home.</p>
<p>Mattel announced that Midge was expecting a baby girl and released a version of the doll that allowed you to pop off Midge&#8217;s pregnant belly and find a baby curled up inside it. The company argued the doll could be a totally not awkward teaching tool for families&mdash;though we should note that that&#8217;s not how babies actually emerge from human bodies.</p>
<p>Some Wal-Mart customers were reportedly none-too-pleased with the pregnant doll. Apparently they thought it promoted teen pregnancy, which is odd because Midge was a married adult, but whatever. <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2002/12/25/news/midge/"  target="_blank">Wal-Mart pulled Midge from its shelves</a>, and Mattel produced a version with a flat belly and baby on the outside of her body. The new Alan came with a stroller.</p>
<p id="ikkFN2">Alan and Midge basically disappeared after that&mdash;no doubt to enjoy their family in privacy after the pregnancy media circus. Midge reappeared in 2012 on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120414170634/http://dreamhouse.barbie.com/en-US/"  target="_blank"><em>Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse</em></a> animated show: Mattel started selling new Midge dolls in conjunction with the show&#8217;s release. And Alan was never seen again&#8230;until Gerwig&#8217;s movie.</p>
<p>Delightfully, Fennell&#8217;s Midge appears to be pregnant in the upcoming film, a nod at deep Barbie lore.</p>

      <title>States Consider Banning Cosmetics Containing PFAS</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Vermont, California, Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, and more have passed or are considering restrictions.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6269617"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6269617/cosmetics-pfas-ban/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>A growing number of state legislatures are considering bans on cosmetics and other consumer products that contain a group of synthetic, potentially harmful chemicals known as <a href="https://time.com/6254060/pfas-period-chemicals-underwear-tampons/" >PFAS</a>.</p>
<p>In Vermont, the state Senate gave final approval this week to legislation that would prohibit manufacturers and suppliers from selling or distributing any cosmetics or menstrual products in the state that have perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, as well as a number of other chemicals.</p>
<p>The products include shampoo, makeup, deodorant, sunscreen, hair dyes and more, said state Sen. Terry Williams, a Republican, and member of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many known toxic chemicals are used in or found as contaminants in personal care products, including PFAS, lead and formaldehyde,&#8221; Williams said in reporting the bill to Senate colleagues.</p>
<p>California, Colorado and Maryland passed similar restrictions on cosmetics that go into effect in 2025. Other proposals are under consideration in Washington and Oregon while bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Rhode Island and Georgia.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, studies have linked PFAS exposure to increased cancer risk, developmental delays in children, damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid, increased cholesterol levels and reduced immune functions, especially among young children.</p>
<p>Like in Colorado and California, the proposed Vermont crackdown on PFAS&mdash;known as &ldquo;forever chemicals&rdquo; for their persistence in the environment&mdash;goes beyond cosmetics. The bill, which now must be considered by the Vermont House, would extend the ban to apparel, including outdoor apparel for severe wet conditions, athletic turf, clothing, ski wax and textiles, including upholstery, draperies, towels and bedding that intentionally contain PFAS. It gives various timelines for the phaseouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must stop importing dangerous chemicals like PFAS into our state so we can prevent the harms they are causing up and down the supply chain &#8212; from their production and use to their disposal,&rdquo; Lauren Hierl, executive director of Vermont Conservation Voters, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In March, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the <a href="https://time.com/6263222/pfas-water-epa/" >first federal limits on the chemicals in drinking water</a>, saying the protection will save thousands of lives and prevent serious illnesses, including cancer. The chemicals had been used since the 1940s in consumer products and industry, including in nonstick pans, food packaging and firefighting foam. Their use is now mostly phased out in the U.S., but some still remain. Pressure is also growing to remove PFAS from food packaging.</p>
<p>A study by University of Notre Dame researchers released in 2021 found that more than half the cosmetics sold in the United States and Canada were awash with a toxic industrial compound associated with serious health conditions.</p>
<p>Researchers tested more than 230 commonly used cosmetics and found that 56% of foundations and eye products, 48% of lip products and 47% of mascaras contained fluorine&mdash;an indicator of PFAS.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says on its website that there have been few studies of the presence of PFAS in cosmetics, and the ones published found the concentration is at very low levels.</p>
<p>The Personal Care Products Council, which represents the cosmetics industry, says in 2020 it supported California legislation to phase out certain ingredients, including 13 PFAS in cosmetics, and identical legislative language in Maryland the following year. The group called for states to pass uniform laws to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>As for bans on apparel containing the chemicals, the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association supports the bill passed unanimously in the Vermont Senate and appreciates that amendments were made to align with phase-out timelines in existing PFAS restrictions in California and <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S1322"  target="_blank">New York</a>, said Chelsea Murtha, AAFA&rsquo;s director of sustainability, in a statement.</p>
<p>The Outdoor Industry Association, based on Colorado, said overall it supports the Vermont bill, also noted the current version more closely matches the timeline for compliance with California&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are also appreciative of the exemption for outdoor apparel severe wet conditions until 2028, as our industry is diligently working to move toward non-regrettable alternatives that will not compromise consumer safety or the quality of the product,&rdquo; said president Kent Ebersole in a statement.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed a first-of-its-kind law Wednesday night that criminalizes any adult who helps a minor undergo an abortion through a procedure or medication in another state without parental consent. </span></p>
<p>Under the law, adults would be facing felony charges and could be punished with two to five years in state prison for aiding with procuring an abortion, whether that be driving a minor across state lines, or helping them find an abortion provider out-of-state. Doctors who perform abortions would also be liable to criminal penalties. The law adds to the state&rsquo;s near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions unless a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest (which has to be reported to law enforcement), or is a life-saving measure.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the measure have heralded the law as a continuation of the state&rsquo;s right to ban abortions. &#8220;With the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s reversal of Roe vs. Wade last summer, the right and duty to establish legal policy on abortion was finally returned to our state democratic process,&#8221; Gov. Little </span><a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/transmittal_h-242aaS_2023.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Idaho legislature on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents warn that this law adds on to the continuous attacks against the bodily autonomy of youth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If young people are unable to travel for care, they are forced to either self-manage an abortion and take on the potential legal risks, or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term along with the serious consequences that can have for their health and well-being,&rdquo; says Megan Darby, Director of State Policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization. &ldquo;Young people&mdash;along with everyone in Idaho and across the country&mdash;deserve compassionate and affordable access to the whole spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law is set to go into effect in thirty days. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the new law do? </span></h2>
<p>The new law, formerly known as House Bill 242, criminalizes so-called &ldquo;abortion trafficking&rdquo; by making it illegal to obtain abortion pills for minors or help them leave the state to obtain an abortion, with the intent of hiding the abortion from a minor&rsquo;s parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Under the law, the father, grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle of the unborn child has a right to sue an adult who helps a minor obtain an abortion up to four years after the abortion. The law also allows the specified family members to file lawsuits against out-of-state doctors who perform these abortions.</p>
<p>The criminal ban does say that adults who help pregnant minors access abortions with the consent of parents/legal guardians have an affirmative defense. That means that if a defendant presents evidence that a minor&rsquo;s parent or guardian agreed the child could travel out-of-state for an abortion, they do not have criminal liability.</p>
<p>The measure, however, says it is not an affirmative defense for an abortion provider or the provider of an abortion pill to be out of state. In other words, if a pregnant minor has a physician across state lines and obtains an abortion, that procedure is illegal.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violators can face anywhere from two to five years in state prison. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would the law be implemented?</span></h2>
<p>The passage of the law does not mean it&#8217;s necessarily popular with Idahoans. In a poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii but conducted by public opinion firm Lake Research Partners, nearly<a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-alliance-advocates/issues/idaho-opinion-research-health#:~:text=Forty%2Dfive%20percent%20of%20Idaho,remain%20legal%20in%20many%20circumstances."  target="_blank"> half of all Idaho voters</a> reported being pro-choice, with 24% saying they think abortion should be generally available and only subject to &ldquo;limited regulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There&#8217;s been a movement among progressive prosecutors to say that they&#8217;re not going to prosecute some abortion offenses,&rdquo; says Cynthia Soohoo, Co-Director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at CUNY School of Law. &ldquo;But the law actually gives the Attorney General the power to enforce the law if local prosecutors don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of implementation, experts tell TIME, prosecutors would have to have substantial evidence that someone crossed state lines to access care. Because Idaho is between Washington and Oregon, where legislators are already working to enact shield protection laws, there is likely to be a conflict of state laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shield laws explicitly protect abortion providers from lawsuits if an out-of-state patient receives an abortion, but these laws also often protect &ldquo;helpers.&rdquo; The loose phrasing of the word helper applies to people who assist with the abortion, Elisabeth Smith, Director of State Policy and Advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights tells TIME that &ldquo;assistance could be anything [from] driving someone to the clinic, to providing financial assistance, to helping them make the appointment.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shield laws also prohibit that state from &ldquo;collaborating with any investigation that is about the provision of or assistance with reproductive health care,&rdquo; according to Smith. &ldquo;And so part of that prohibition on collaboration is a prohibition on subpoenas and providing evidence.&rdquo; In other words, states like Idaho would be unable to access medical records or other evidence of abortion care if neighboring states do pass shield laws, </span>making it difficult for a prosecutor to gather evidence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, it&#8217;s imperative that people who are seeking abortion care be private about their actions, Smith says. &ldquo;Thinking about how each of us share information, what information we put on social media, and what messaging services we use to share information [is critical] because again, none of these prosecutions can go forward without enough information to prove that someone has helped a young person access abortion,&rdquo; Smith tells TIME. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho&rsquo;s current abortion laws </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/state/idaho/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;which is modeled after a law in Texas&mdash;bars abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The Idaho Supreme Court upheld the ban</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this January, </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/05/idaho-supreme-court-abortion-ban-00076704"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that said that the right to abortion was implied in Idaho&rsquo;s constitution. Justice Robyn Brody, who presided over the case, said that abortion advocates&rsquo; argument had no backing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion continues to be a contentious issue in the state. Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union </span><a href="https://www.acluidaho.org/en/press-releases/idaho-attorney-general-prohibits-out-state-referrals-abortion-health-care-providers"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced on Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they are suing Idaho Attorney General Ra&uacute;l Labrador after he </span><a href="https://759dc218-b8c7-48ed-a4df-e92eb29273e5.filesusr.com/ugd/be9708_de4a35f4a6854c0690cf88ecc810f97a.pdf"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a legal opinion that said state law prohibits medical practitioners from referring a patient across state lines to obtain abortion services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His opinion said that even doctors who offer information about abortion providers and funds in other states would violate Idaho&rsquo;s existing abortion ban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is a five-alarm fire. Banning abortion wasn&rsquo;t enough for anti-abortion extremists in Idaho; they now want to ban where you go, what information you&rsquo;re legally allowed to obtain, and even what health care providers can say,&rdquo; Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/idaho-attorney-general-prohibits-out-of-state-referrals-for-abortion-health-care-providers-sue"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &ldquo;Attorney General Labrador&rsquo;s opinion is an egregious extension of Idaho&rsquo;s abortion ban. We won&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the rising number of anti-LGBTQ bills seen flooding state legislatures, Soohoo says it is very likely other conservative states will attempt to pass copycat laws, which would have similar provisions to Idaho&rsquo;s law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;There is actually a long history of writing laws initially to challenge Roe vs. Wade or to limit access to abortion by conservative think tanks [that] draft these laws and then share them amongst state legislature[s].&rdquo; Soohoo tells TIME. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&rsquo;s next for Idaho? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion access is likely to remain limited in the state after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which will have dire consequences on pregnant people in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;In 50 years, when someone or multiple people, write the definitive history of all of the harms that flowed from the Dobb&rsquo;s decision, there are countless harms that we are not yet aware of right now&hellip; in terms of maternal mortality and morbidity [in the state],&rdquo; Smith says. </span></p>
<p>There have already been reports of at least one hospital <a href="https://bonnergeneral.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bonner-General-Health-Press-Release-Closure-of-LD-3.17.2023.pdf"  target="_blank">discontinuing</a> its labor and delivery services, which they say is partially because of Idaho&rsquo;s political climate. And <span style="font-weight: 400;">efforts to track the effects of the state&rsquo;s anti-abortion laws remain up in the air as the state&rsquo;s existing special committee that studies maternal deaths </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/20/a-law-meant-to-save-lives-of-idaho-mothers-is-on-the-chopping-block-will-lawmakers-keep-it/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is set to end</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the national front, experts say that Congress needs to act, though their most recent attempts have not been fruitful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, House Democrats attempted to pass the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022 that would protect health care providers who provide abortion services to out-of-state residents, people who help pregnant people travel across state lines for an abortion, and more. The bill </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed in the House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July 2022, but did not move forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Republicans also blocked the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022, which would have protected people who travel state lines to receive an abortion and physicians who perform them. </span></p>

<p>Almost every day of my two decades as a political reporter, I get a call, an email, or a text from a clever staffer asking when the last time the opposition had to answer for Topic X. <i>Someone really ought to ask him about that</i>, they&rsquo;ll tell me. <i>Have you seen his comments from 10 years ago?</i> It&rsquo;s a classic tactic that&rsquo;s getting retooled for our modern media landscape. Working the refs, as it is, has never been so transparent. Talk to almost any operative working beyond the Beltway, and they&rsquo;ll tell you they have almost no one in the communities they are focused on who can take one of those suggested questions and run with it. That&rsquo;s why more of those &ldquo;tips&rdquo; have been coming in recent years to people like me.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The fact that the national campaign committees are pitching opposition research on local candidates to reporters in Washington says more about the health of local journalism than their hopes of turning a rival into a late-night punching bag.</p>
<p>This goes far beyond anecdotes, and as someone who is a Midwest transplant to D.C., I&rsquo;m particularly sensitive to how the persistent and pernicious decline of local journalism is disrupting that region.</p>
<p>In a new paper <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/17/article/882956"  target="_blank">published</a> in the spring edition of <i>The Middle West Review</i>, historian Jon K. Lauck looks at the state of journalism in the Midwest states, and the topline observations are not reason for optimism for those who think a free and fair press is a vital component to the Jeffersonian notion of a well-informed electorate being a requisite component of a healthy democracy. In fact, the unspoken indictment is that the press&mdash;and its owners&mdash;are failing bigly in its part to help voters make the best choices possible.</p>
<p>Take the well-regarded Omaha <i>World-Herald</i>, a towering newspaper that once <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/03/08/buffett-stopped-loving-his-hometown-paper-but-still-makes-pocket-change-from-papers-he-sold/"  target="_blank">counted</a> local billionaire Warren Buffett as its owner. Lauck notes that the paper had more than 200 journalists in 2015 and started this year with about 40. The losses, of course, correspond to the decimation of readership: in 1980, the Sunday edition counted 302,000 copies rolling off its presses; these days, it&rsquo;s about 40,000. And, not for nothing, the Omaha coverage area historically has included a whole lot of western Iowa, a stretch where conservative candidates seeking the GOP presidential nomination have shaken-up that state&rsquo;s lead-off caucuses.</p>
<p>The pattern continues throughout the region. For the Des Moines <i>Register</i>, arguably the most important voice in Iowa&rsquo;s political landscape, the Sunday run went from 535,000 copies in the 1970s down to 53,000 during 2020. The Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer </i>printed almost 500,000 copies on weekdays in the 1980s but ended 2019 with a daily circulation of about 95,000. All of these newsrooms are struggling with the fact that digital readers are not as profitable to them, and often not as engaged as the ones who used to subscribe to the print product. Down Interstate 71, The Columbus <i>Dispatch</i> has seen its coverage in the state&rsquo;s biggest city shrink from about 250 journalists in its late-1990s newsroom to about 40 these days. And then there&rsquo;s Youngstown, Ohio, where I started my journalism career. It&rsquo;s now the largest city in America <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/04/738724390/longtime-newspaper-to-shut-down-in-youngstown-ohio#:~:text=The%20Vindicator%20newspaper%20of%20Youngstown,nation%20without%20a%20major%20newspaper."  target="_blank">without</a> its own stand-alone newspaper.</p>
<p>The media landscape has changed over the last 20 years in vast ways, with online publishing and advertising threatening our business offices and assumptions in ways great and small. It&rsquo;s no secret that we as an industry have struggled to keep up. But beyond hollowed-out newsrooms or shuttered papers, the broader threat is one to democracy itself, one that will be more noticeable in 2024 than any previous election cycle. Without independent journalists to cover, analyze, and query candidates and their campaigns, voters are left to rely on the spin and propaganda that the political machines themselves churn out. Some of it is quite good, but none of it is self-critical. After all, Rep. George Santos arrived in Congress with very <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/george-santos-congress-scandal-campaign-finance-complete-coverage-uie3unwn"  target="_blank">little</a> friction blocking his acquisition of a voting card as a fabulist from New York. Without someone standing ready with a notebook, tape recorder (or iPhone app, as the case is nowadays), and just plain clear eyes on a candidate, voters aren&rsquo;t really getting the full picture.</p>
<p>All this has me thinking back to my trip in late October to Ohio, where an open Senate race between Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance was drawing strong national interest. I had followed Ryan for some Thursday night tailgating at Bowling Green State, his alma mater.</p>
<p>The late-October air was crisp, the beer outside the football stadium even chillier, the cornhole set up for undergrads and alumni alike. Ryan, coming off a busy day of campaigning, spent the evening tossing the football with his son and College Democrats, and making small talk with students who wandered by. In the distance, echoes of the marching band bounced off the benches in the stadium.</p>
<p>A few years ago, such a pitch-perfect photo-op would have drawn a bevy of local political journalists trying to get a bead on a candidate&rsquo;s messaging and campaign style. But that night, there was only a single local online <a href="https://bgindependentmedia.org/tim-ryan-returns-to-his-alma-mater-bgsu-to-tailgate-with-voters/"  target="_blank">journalist</a>, a New York-based wire photographer, and the D.C.-based <a href="https://time.com/6228353/tim-ryan-ohio-trump-voters/" >me</a>.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not why Ryan lost his Senate race. No, there&rsquo;s been <a href="https://time.com/6227612/sherrod-brown-popularity-ohio-senate/" >just one</a> Democrat who has won statewide office in Ohio in the last decade, and that&rsquo;s incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. Ohio&rsquo;s place as a <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/politics/2008/06/16/obama-camp-sees-possible-win/52376074007/"  target="_blank">swing state</a> seems to be a thing of the past, although not everyone subscribes to that theory. No pictures of Ryan tossing a football with his son, Brady, would have narrowed his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/results/ohio/senate"  target="_blank">six-point</a> loss. (Though, for what it&rsquo;s worth, Joe Biden lost Ohio by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/ohio/"  target="_blank">eight points</a> two years earlier.)</p>
<p>But when a major candidate in such a high-profile race is interacting with voters days before Election Day, the lack of curiosity from the local press corps, stemming in large part from its lack of bodies, speaks volumes about the larger difficulties of Ohioans getting a proper sense of their state&rsquo;s shifting political landscape.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/media/amy-klobuchar-reliable-sources-big-tech-local-journalism/index.html"  target="_blank">championing</a> a bill to help local newsrooms compete for ad dollars against tech giants. As Klobuchar, a daughter of a newspaperman, knows, no one is better at interpreting local events than the people who live in those communities. The death of expertise is simultaneously bad for the newsrooms, but also voters.</p>
<p>The political press doesn&rsquo;t always get it right&mdash;my Twitter replies are proof enough of that view&mdash;but it fills an important role in helping voters understand the issues and stakes of a campaign. Without that coverage, voters are left to listen to whichever candidates&rsquo; ads can dominate the airwaves and digital screens, most of it guided by the whims of deep-pocketed donors. That, put plainly, isn&rsquo;t what democracy should look like, especially not in a part of the country where hyper-local candidates can often defy national trends, if only someone credible is there to explain why.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Michelle Williams gives a terrific performance as an ornery artist in Kelly Reichardt's latest film. ]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6269405"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6269405/showing-up-review/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Making anything of value&mdash;a work of art, a poem, a solid piece of furniture&mdash;demands a deep descent into the self, to the point that it&rsquo;s easy to neglect the needs of others in your orbit. Stay in the zone too long and there&rsquo;s a danger of forgetting how to have a simple conversation or make a phone call, of going a little feral. Going into that inner wilderness is great, as long as we can follow the trail of bread crumbs back to the <a href="https://time.com/6269239/beef-ali-wong-steven-yeun/" >world of human connection</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one of the ideas at play in Kelly Reichardt&rsquo;s quietly extraordinary <i>Showing Up,</i> a movie so fine-grained that you&rsquo;re almost not prepared for the subtle power of its ending&mdash;the story is brought to land, almost literally, with the beating of wings. <a href="https://time.com/4549389/michelle-williams-interview-manchester-by-the-sea/" >Michelle Williams</a> is Lizzy, a sculptor living in Portland, Ore., and getting ready to mount a small but, for her, important show. Before we even meet her, we see soft watercolor sketches of her ceramic works-in-progress, carefully molded figures of women of all ages who seem to be dancing, or weeping, or possibly both. These works are rounding the bend toward completion, and we watch as Lizzy scrutinizes them, tracing their now hardened contours, as if trying to reclaim with her fingers one last memory of the formerly soft clay. This, in movie form, is one idea of what it&rsquo;s like to make and think about art; its meaning can seem to pass through our skin, a mysterious vibration.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>But like all artists Lizzy is also, whether she wants to be or not, a person living in the world. She has a small studio and living space that she rents from her closest friend, Jo (the <a href="https://time.com/6259203/oscar-nominees-to-watch-2023/" >remarkable Hong Chau</a>), also an artist, with a personality as breezy as Lizzy&rsquo;s is thorny: though she too is preparing a local show&mdash;two, in fact&mdash;she&rsquo;s happy to spend any spare time she&rsquo;s got installing a tire swing in the backyard of her small apartment building, rather than addressing the more immediate problem presented by Lizzy&rsquo;s broken hot-water heater. Lizzy watches, her brow a tiny thundercloud, as Jo twirls in her newly installed swing, living the idea of what we want an artist&rsquo;s life to be. Everything about Lizzy is coiled tight: What about her hot water? What about <i>her</i> needs? She&rsquo;s preparing a show too. She stands there, sullen but also perplexed, her arms dangling in her shapeless cotton clothes like a Roz Chast cartoon come to life.</p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Courtesy of A24</span><span class="caption" >Michelle Williams and Hong Chau in &#8216;Showing Up&#8217;</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the magic of Williams&rsquo; performance, playing a woman whose art demands deep inner travel, but whose movement through the everyday world could use some improvement. Retreating into the world of her &ldquo;girls,&rdquo; as others refer to her sculptures, is less bewildering to Lizzy than the real life she&rsquo;s stuck with. She has a dull day job in a small arts college run by her mother Jean (Maryann Plunkett); her father Bill (Judd Hirsch), once a prolific ceramicist, has retreated into a world of flaky hippiedom. She&rsquo;s also consumed with worry about her brother Sean (played superbly by John Magaro). He may be the biggest genius of the whole gang, but he&rsquo;s also the most fragile, a semilost soul whose clumsy manners belong to another world.</p>
<p>Lizzy has more moderate problems too: it&rsquo;s her cat, Ricky, a small orange jerk, who sets the plot in motion with a flick of his paw. Lizzy is bedeviled by all of it, and Williams, a formidable actor, channels her annoyance like a subsonic hum. This is the fourth movie she and Reichardt have made together. They&rsquo;re simpatico souls; Reichardt (who also co-wrote the script, with her frequent collaborator Jonathan Raymond) couldn&rsquo;t have made a movie as weird and great and intimate as this one with just anybody. The <a href="https://time.com/6182784/cannes-film-festival-movies-significance/" >on-the-surface modesty</a> of <i>Showing Up</i> is a kind of sorcery. It&rsquo;s in the days afterward, when you&rsquo;ve left its spell and gone back to the world, that its essence is more likely to take shape&mdash;a shape you could almost trace with your thumb, as if it were made of clay and not images, air, and feeling.</p>

      <title>How One Group Reunites Ukrainian Children With Their Families—and Their Identities</title>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds, if not thousands of Ukrainian parents don&rsquo;t know where their children are. And for many, the answer is terrifying: across the frontlines and scattered across Russia, a 6.6 million square mile country that has invaded their homeland. This is the result, Ukraine and international observers say, of a systematic effort at the highest levels of the Russian government to separate Ukrainian children from their families and their identity as Ukrainians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Russia has contended that it has relocated children in an effort to protect them, it does not appear to be making an effort to reunite the children with their parents. Instead, observers say, it appears to be working to erase their identity through re-education and integration into Russian families. </span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These accusations have led the International Criminal Court to <a href="https://time.com/6264280/vladimir-putin-icc-warrant-arrest/" >charge Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> with <a href="https://time.com/6266991/ukraine-push-putin-war-crimes/" >violations of international law</a>, alongside </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the Commissioner for Children&rsquo;s Rights&mdash;who adopted a Ukrainian child herself and is thought to be leading the program. Such crimes against children, some experts say, <a href="https://time.com/6262903/russia-ukraine-genocide-war-crimes/" >may even be evidence of genocide</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who are unable to rescue their children themselves must turn to others for help, including the charity Save Ukraine. Founded in 2014, the NGO has helped about 90,000 people escape the conflict in the last year. It also provided many families with short and long-term shelter and rehabilitation services to help them rebuild their lives, including trauma therapy, education and job services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Save Ukraine launched an even more daunting project: rescuing Ukrainian children who have been taken into Russia and Russian-occupied territory, says Save Ukraine&rsquo;s founder, Mykola Kubela, who served as the children&rsquo;s ombudsman for the president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2021. Traveling by plane or bus, it has shepherded dozens of desperate relatives through Poland and Belarus to circumvent the front lines and then into enemy territory. Over the last year the group says they&#8217;ve brought 95 children home from Russia and Russian-occupied territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Kuleba, while there are still thousands of children to be saved, their work is only becoming more difficult. A Ukrainian</span><a href="https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/"  target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">national database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has identified over 19,000 children who have been deported to Russia, and the locations of thousands more is unknown. And as time goes by, Kuleba says that children are becoming harder to find as Russia works to erase their identities, including by placing them in adoptive families and changing their names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuleba spoke to TIME in March from a Save the Children&rsquo;s shelter in Kyiv&mdash;where 200 women and children are currently living&mdash;about the obstacles his organization faces rescuing thousands of others.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. </span></i></p>
<h3>TIME: How do you bring children back from Russia?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubela: It is a very complicated process. It&#8217;s very hard to find these children if they are in Russia. They try to hide the children, or they send the children to Russian families to adopt them, place them under guardianship or foster care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just yesterday, we returned one child&mdash;a 14-year-old boy, Konstantin&mdash;from Anapa, in Russia. He was abducted from occupied territory in the Kherson region; he&rsquo;d been in a reeducation camp for several months. The Russians said they will not return him, and if nobody comes, he will be adopted. He only had a father, but he&rsquo;s very sick, and he had several sisters, and they were afraid to go to Russia. They&rsquo;re a very poor family, and they had to spend thousands of dollars to cross several borders to reach Anapa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[His 18-year-old sister] was in a group of mothers and relatives that rescued 17 children. [She] successfully reached the facility, and we helped her to negotiate there. He had been in a foster family for two weeks. They brainwashed him, and when she found him, he told her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to return to Ukraine. My parents told me that if I return back, Ukrainian Nazis will kill me because I was in Russia.&rdquo; He told her, &ldquo;if I agree to receive status as an orphan, the Russian government will help me. They will give me a flat; they will keep giving me money; they will put me in a technical school.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She worked with him for three days. She told him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. I&rsquo;m your sister, your father is dying. He wants to be with you.&rdquo; She worked with him for three days to convince him that he can successfully and safely return to Ukraine. And just yesterday, they crossed the border. </span></p>
<h3>What kind of obstacles do you face?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the time, we have to change our routes, because every time, the Russians try to block our missions. We do it differently every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&rsquo;t tell you a lot, but we have guys who were arrested in Belarus. It&rsquo;s very dangerous for anybody who tries to help anything having to do with Ukrainians there. That&#8217;s why we have to carefully plan our missions, because it could be very dangerous for these mothers and for children, or for any people who can provide support.</span></p>
<h3>How do you locate children in Russian territory?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use different tools. First of all, we have a hotline through which we receive information from people who are in Ukraine or abroad. Because we&rsquo;re the biggest NGO in Ukraine who provides rescue missions, rescuing people from combat zones, many people know us and send us information about children who were deported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very often, the children who were returned report to us about other children who stayed in their facilities in Russia or Crimea, and then we find their relatives. Or, when relatives ask us to find a child, we find them through other children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two hours ago, I talked with a journalist who told me she knows the father of a boy being held in a facility in Russia. We recognized information about that boy&mdash;we just returned another child from the facility who knew the boy was being held there, and they&rsquo;re communicating through social media. Our next steps will be to communicate with the father, and take him on our next rescue mission. And to return that boy from the Russian Federation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very many children who are staying in Russia don&rsquo;t know where their parents are. We try to find their parents, but they could be in occupied territories, or in the Russian Federation, or they could have been killed. Or imprisoned. They could be in filtration camps. Sometimes we know information about the child, but we don&#8217;t know anything about the parents.</span></p>
<h3>Does paperwork pose a problem?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. For example, we prepare international passports for all these parents. For many of them, it&rsquo;s their first trip to Russia or to Europe&mdash;because we go through Poland, Belarus. They are very poor families, and very often, they have no documents. That&rsquo;s why we have to help them to receive documents for a child, and receive legal permission from different government organizations. Without documents, it&rsquo;s impossible to bring a child back.</span></p>
<h3>If children are orphans, or if you can&rsquo;t find their parents, are you thinking about ways to bring them back in the future?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a very hard question. Last year, Putin signed legislation in May which simplifies receiving Russian citizenship, to simplify the procedure of adoption. Through the adoption process, Russia can change the last name and date of birth of any child to give them Russian citizenship. After that, the child can disappear in Russia&mdash;especially little kids. That&#8217;s why we have to hurry to return them to Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is our goal to raise awareness about what Russia is doing with our children, with our families, how they try to destroy Ukrainian identity and Russify our children. It is genocide.</span></p>
<h3>What do you think the world needs to do to bring the children home?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, to help us to fight with Russia, to de-occupy our territories, to clean our land from Russia. Second&mdash;the ICC&rsquo;s decision on President Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova was a very good sign for us, because it was the beginning of the process of punishing them as war criminals. After that, maybe we will receive our children back, and they will be returned.</span></p>

<p>Sports movies are back, baby. For a stretch in the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, &#8217;90s, and even &#8217;00s, <a href="https://time.com/4127432/30-greatest-sports-films/" >sports movies</a> were inescapable. Beginning with <em>Rocky</em>, feel-good <a href="https://time.com/4116452/original-rocky-review-creed/" >tales of triumph</a> became reliable box office juggernauts. Motivational underdog sagas attracted the whole family. And whether the coach of a sports team was inspirational <em>(Remember the</em> <em>Titans</em>) or irascible (<em>A League of Their Own</em>), he was usually played by a big movie star (Denzel Washington or Tom Hanks&mdash;ever heard of them?).</p>
<p>Commercially successful movies about athletes often doubled as <a href="https://time.com/6196424/emmy-bait-nominations-2022/" >Oscar bait</a>: <em>Jerry Maguire,</em> <em>The Blindside,</em> and <em>Seabiscuit</em> all made over $100 million and scored Academy Award nominations. And then there was the entire subgenre poking fun at the self-seriousness of sports movies&mdash;<em>Caddy Shack, </em><em>Dodgeball</em>, <em>Talladega Nights</em><em>.</em> Let&#8217;s not forget about the romantic sports movies&mdash;<em>Bull Durham</em>, <em>Bend it Like Beckham, </em><em>Fever Pitch&mdash;</em>or the tragic sports movies&mdash;<em>Million Dollar Baby</em>, <em>Foxcatcher</em>, <em>Rudy</em>.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>But somewhere on the flip side of <em>The</em> <em>Blind Side</em>, the sports movie all but disappeared. Sure, we&#8217;d get a movie like <em>Creed</em> or <em>Moneyball</em> every few years. But those were the exceptions. Like the rom-com and the adult drama, the sports movie belonged to a class of mid-budget film that seemed destined to languish on the heap of detritus left behind after <a href="https://time.com/5857064/defunding-police-superheroes-onscreen/" >superheroes smashed up the box office</a>. <em>Iron Man</em> kicked off the MCU in 2008 and by 2012 when <em>The Avengers</em> debuted, sports movies took a backseat. Disney (which owns Marvel) released the Jon Hamm baseball flick <em>Million Dollar Arm</em> in 2014, a movie that had such a disappointing box office return that it seemed to scare the studio that gave us <em>Air Bud</em>, <em>The Mighty Ducks</em>, and <em>Miracle</em> from putting similar stories in theaters indefinitely.</p>
<p>The 2010s marked a nadir for the genre. In their greedy pursuit of films featuring inexplicably jacked characters in tights who use all that physical power to do little but shoot laser beams at one another to save the multiverse, studios set aside the all too human athletes who use their strength to achieve much humbler goals. Studios dedicated larger and larger budgets to comic book movies and offered smaller sums to sports films.</p>
<p>But change is in the air. This year&#8217;s box office has been <a href="https://time.com/6252327/80-for-brady-older-women/" >dominated by athletes</a> as much as superheroes. As <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </em>and <em>Shazam: Fury of the Gods </em>floundered at the box office, <em>Creed III </em>and <em>80 for Brady</em> proved to be first-quarter hits. Ahead of its release this week, Ben Affleck&#8217;s <em>Air</em> has scored a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and generated buzz that may just propel its director-star through awards season. Sure, <em>Air</em><em>, </em>a movie about a billion-dollar company designing a shoe, is more sports-adjacent than some of these other titles. But the cheers at the obligatory montage of Michael Jordan&#8217;s careers highs and lows in my screening of the film would seem to indicate that people were there to <a href="https://time.com/6268621/air-true-story-behind-movie/" >see MJ as much as Matt Damon</a>.</p>
<p>And the rest of the year is chock-full of movies about competitors: Zendaya has a sports movie coming out (tennis). So do Michael Fassbender (soccer) and Adam Driver (racing). This may just be the year of the sports movie&#8217;s glorious return.</p>
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>

<p>How to explain this sudden course change for Hollywood? Perhaps during the pandemic, studio executives tuned into Netflix&#8217;s gigantic hit of a docuseries <em>The Last Dance</em> about Jordan&#8217;s historic run with the Chicago Bulls and remembered that sports are compelling and dramatic and full of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t4RVg_Yq2g"  target="_blank">delicious trash talk</a>. (We know for a fact that <em>Air</em> screenwriter Alex Convery <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/04/air-exists-because-its-screenwriter-saw-the-last-dance.html"  target="_blank">actually got the idea for <em>Air</em></a> while watching the fifth episode of <em>The Last Dance.</em>) Those same executives could have tuned into another huge pandemic hit, Apple TV+&#8217;s soccer dramedy <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and remembered that the wins and losses of sports function as rather heartwarming metaphor for the human condition. It could be that, before all the Will Smith drama, <em>King Richard</em> reminded Hollywood that the Oscars love a sports movie.</p>

<p>But several new sports movies have been in development for years, long before <a href="https://time.com/6081493/ted-lasso-season-2/" >Jason Sudeikis grew his Ted Lasso mustache</a>. So maybe, just maybe, filmmakers sensed we were getting sick of superheroes and wanted our normal, run-of-the-mill heroes back. Filmmakers determined to bring back sports movies have contorted them to fit into the new Hollywood landscape where there&#8217;s little room for anything but middle-brow streaming shows and comic book movies. And they found three main ways to do this: by cloaking a new story in old IP, finding a streamer with the ambition to make movies like they used to, or trotting out the old Academy Awards playbook.</p>

<p>As writer-director <a href="https://time.com/4128234/creed-director-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan/" >Ryan Coogler told me way back in 2015</a>, the original <em>Creed </em>film was born from the love for the <em>Rocky</em> franchise that he shared with his father. But given that studios only seem to greenlight sequels and spinoffs these days, one can&#8217;t help but wonder whether a studio would have ever greenlit an original boxing movie from Coogler without any ties to a known cinematic hero. Three movies in, <em>Creed III</em> has become what we might call a tangential franchise. Technically, it still belongs to the <em>Rocky</em> universe but has distanced itself so far from the original IP that Sylvester Stallone doesn&#8217;t appear in the film, and <em>Creed III </em>never actually plays the iconic <em>Rocky</em> theme song. And yet <em>Creed III</em> still set a franchise box office record its opening weekend. At this point Adonis Creed does not need Rocky Balboa in his corner in order to succeed.</p>
<p>We might also slate the upcoming <em>Gran</em> <em>Turismo</em>, out Aug. 11, into the &#8220;tangential franchise&#8221; category since it&#8217;s building off the success of the video game of the same name. It has a bizarre spon-con sounding premise: It&#8217;s centered on a kid who becomes a race car driver after winning a Nissan-sponsored video game competition (presumably on a Sony Playstation given that the film is being made by Sony). But it stars David Harbour and Orlando Bloom, and Neill Blomkamp, who made the very good <em>District</em> <em>9</em>, is directing it.</p>
<p>Could other new franchises blossom from the dusty remains of old ones? Perhaps. Given studios&#8217; ongoing reliance on familiar stories and characters, it&#8217;s frankly mind-boggling we haven&#8217;t gotten <a href="https://time.com/6259594/creed-3-rocky-franchise/" >more modern updates like </a><em><a href="https://time.com/6259594/creed-3-rocky-franchise/" >Creed</a>.</em></p>

<p>OK, that&#8217;s not entirely true. Studios <em>are</em> rebooting and sequelizing a lot of sports movies. They just wind up as television shows on streaming services. <em>A League of Their Own</em>, <em>Mighty Ducks</em>, and <em>White Men Can&#8217;t Jump</em> all recently got television treatments (or soon will).</p>
<p>But streamers seem willing to occasionally invest in original sports films that harken back to an era when the genre could find both critical and commercial success. In Netflix&#8217;s <em>Hustle</em> Adam Sandler plays an NBA talent scout who takes a player under his wing before the draft. Not only did it <a href="https://time.com/6185638/adam-sandler-hustle-nba-stars/" >feature legitimate NBA stars</a> (who made for surprisingly good actors), but it got enough buzz that it earned Sandler a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Netflix also purchased <em>High Flying Bird</em>, a Steven Soderbergh basketball drama shot entirely on an iPhone that got awards attention.</p>
<p>I suspect that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon would take umbrage with the idea that <em>Air</em>, the story about the creation of the Air Jordan shoe, is primarily a streaming title. In fact, it&#8217;s the first movie from Amazon Studios to get a wide theatrical release since 2019. But Amazon bought that movie because it&#8217;s exactly the sort of inspirational movie that families will watch over and over again at home.</p>

<p>The Academy Awards have a long history of awarding sports movies the top prize: <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, <em>Rocky, and </em><em>Million Dollar Baby</em> won Best Picture. <em>The Hustler</em>, <em>Raging Bull</em>, <em>Jerry Maguire</em>, <em>The Blind Side</em>, and <em>The Fighter</em> have all taken home statues too. Just last year <em>King Richard </em>finally won Will Smith his Oscar.</p>
<p>Lately, the Academy has been loving feel-good films about family: Those themes are about the only commonality shared between the last two <a href="https://time.com/6261965/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-oscars-frontrunner/" >Best Picture winners</a>, <em>CODA</em> and <em>Everything Everywhere All At</em> <em>Once</em>. And here&#8217;s the thing about sports movies: They&#8217;re often feel-good tales of triumph that tend to center on either literal families or a team that acts like a family.</p>
<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6258233/creed-iii-review/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creed III <em>Is the Kind of Movie the Big Screen Was Made For</em></a></p>
<p>And next year may prove the most sports-centric Oscar ceremony ever. It seems to be the subject du jour for Oscar-winning or Oscar-nominated directors. Affleck, who helmed Best Picture winner <em>Argo</em>, has <em>Air</em>; Taika Waititi, who got a nod for <em>Jojo Rabbit,</em> is directing Michael Fassbender in the soccer movie <em>Next Goal Wins</em>; Luca Guadagnino, who broke onto the awards circuit with <em>Call Me By Your Name,</em> is helming a Zendaya tennis film called <em>Challengers</em>; and Michael Mann, nominated for <em>The Insider</em>, is releasing the racing film <em>Ferrari </em>starring Adam Driver.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait some months to tally up the box office totals and awards hauls to see what the future may hold. But for now, at least, we can revel in the glory of those sweaty training montages and slow-motion game-winning shots.</p>
