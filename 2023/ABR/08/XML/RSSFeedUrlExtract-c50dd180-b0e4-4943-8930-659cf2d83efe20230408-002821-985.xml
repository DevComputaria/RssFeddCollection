      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JOE Biden has blamed his country’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan on Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/"&gt;The US President&lt;/a&gt; inherited a deal from his predecessor to pull out forces by May 1, 2021, a State Department and Pentagon report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21980580" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/democratic-presidential-candidate-former-us-685358112.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21980580" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;President Biden blamed his predecessor Donald Trump for the failings around the West&amp;#8217;s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Mr Biden had to either belatedly follow through on the agreement with the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/taliban/"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; or send thousands more troops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pull-out in August 2021 ended the war but 13 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/us-army/"&gt;US soldiers &lt;/a&gt;and 200 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/afghanistan/"&gt;Afghans&lt;/a&gt; were killed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/donald-trump/"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; called it a surrender, adding: “Biden is responsible — no one else.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/british-army/"&gt;British troops&lt;/a&gt; were also involved in the withdrawal, which Defence Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ben-wallace/"&gt;Ben Wallace&lt;/a&gt; said at the time had put the UK “in a very difficult position”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Trump shot back on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; within hours of the report’s release, accusing “Morons in the White House” of playing “a new disinformation game &amp;#8211; Blame “TRUMP” for their grossly incompetent SURRENDER in Afghanistan”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Biden is responsible, no one else!” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ONE tourist has been killed and another five hurt after a car ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians in Tel Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes just hours after two sisters from the UK were &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21978321/two-women-british-killed-west-bank/"&gt;killed when their car was ambushed by gunmen&lt;/a&gt; in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21980211" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/israeli-police-gather-next-overturned-808491354.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21980211" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;One tourists and five others have been killed in Tel Aviv[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21980279" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-israeli-police-said-car-808488324-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21980279" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Israeli police and emergency service stand around the overturn car[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Police found several people injured and an overturned car near a Tel Aviv promenade following the second attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The car had veered off the street near a popular bike and walking path along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is understood the tourists hurt were from the UK and Italy, according to local media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed on Twitter that the man killed was Italian and said others were injured in what he branded a &amp;#8220;cowardly attack&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three of those hurt, including a 17-year-old, were moderately injured, while two had light injuries, the&amp;nbsp;Magen David Adom emergency service said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A police spokesman meanwhile said &amp;#8220;the terrorist was neutralised, it was a terror attack against civilians, a car ramming attack&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mobilised police and army reserves following the suspected terror attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes after two sisters from the UK were shot dead in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victims, aged 15 and 21, died at the scene after their car was attacked by gunmen then rammed by another vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their mother, 48, was also seriously injured when their car was attacked near the Hamra settlement, about 30 miles north of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family is understood to have moved from the UK to Israel in 2005 and settled in Efrat, near the Palestinian city of Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was believed to be a cowardly and indiscriminate revenge strike launched as tensions spiralled following police raids on the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gunmen are believed to have targeted the car simply because it bore Israeli registration plates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A US national was also recently shot dead in similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sisters were in a car that came under fire and was then rammed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures showed white and red cars with serious front end damage following what appeared to be a high speed collision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sisters died at the scene and their mother was airlifted to hospital in a &amp;#8220;very critical condition&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sources in Israel confirmed that the sisters were both originally from London and were aged 15 and 21.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their father &amp;#8211; who attended university in the UK &amp;#8211; had been in a separate car travelling ahead of the women but realised there had been an altercation behind him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He drove back to the scene fearing his family had been involved in a traffic accident then realised the car had come under fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police later reported the vehicle in which the British family was travelling had been riddled with a volley of 22 Kalashnikov assault rifle bullets, leaving blood spattered on the windscreen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distraught dad &amp;#8211; who has not been identified &amp;#8211; was being comforted by family members and friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said its medics initially responded to a vehicle collision on the Route 57 highway in the northern Jordan Valley, near the Hamra Junction, close to the settlement of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When medics and troops reached the scene, the car was found to be riddled with bullet holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambulencemen said two women were declared dead at the scene, and a woman who was critically hurt in the attack was taken to Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital in Jerusalem by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors said she had suffered bullet wounds to her upper body and confirmed she remained “critical”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Force said the shooting was a terror attack and had launched a manhunt for the gunmen and other suspects who fled the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A military spokesman said: “IDF forces are blocking roads in the area and have begun a pursuit of the terrorists.”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978371" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/israeli-security-forces-examine-scene-808414700.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978371" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A 15-year-old girl and a woman, 21, were shot dead in another attack[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VLADIMIR Putin has planned to create a &amp;#8220;new world order&amp;#8221; with his brutal war in Ukraine, a Kremlin spokesperson has said. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; dismissed the chance of negotiations with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, claiming it would not consider peace until all land, including Crimea, was returned from the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; will only consider negotiations if they are based on &amp;#8220;the principles on which the new world order will be based&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also dismissed the chance of peace talks, with Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the presidential office of Ukraine, demanding the wholesale withdrawal of all &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;Russian troops&lt;/a&gt; from Ukrainian territory before negotiations can begin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “The basis for real negotiations with RF is the complete withdrawal of Russian armed groups beyond the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine in 1991. Including #&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7843915/russia-annex-crimea-kerch-strait-ukraine/"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt;. There is no question of any territorial concessions or bargaining of our sovereign rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PANICKED Vladimir Putin has built anti-tank traps and barricades on beaches in Crimea as he fears he will lose the region he illegally annexed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paranoid tyrant has also had a huge number of defence mechanisms including trenches installed close to key access routes in a bid to crush sea and land assaults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978828" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/crimea-preparing-beach-season-digging-808437471.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978828" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Zigzag trenches have been built on beaches and close to key access routes in Crimea[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978838" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 733px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/crimea-preparing-beach-season-digging-808437445.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=723" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978838" width="723" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Barricades have also been installed by Russia[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978869" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7693d188-88ff-4513-a828-da2e409740de.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978869" width="960" height="906" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Crimea&amp;#8217;s beaches are popular with both Russian and Ukrainian tourists&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dragon’s teeth tank traps have been placed at strategic Ak-Monai beside the Taurida highway by occupying &lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt; to stop a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; attempt to grab back the peninsula &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; took in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin has accepted he must decimate the region’s huge tourism industry this summer to hold it against a possible Ukrainian advance as part of an expected Kyiv counteroffensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scale of the operation is seen on both satellite images and ground level pictures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beaches &amp;#8211; one popular with both Russian and Ukrainian tourists as a favourite and glamorous summer playground &amp;#8211; have been rendered virtually unusable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The northern coastlines of Crimea are being defended most acutely amid the clearest signs Putin’s military commanders see the peninsula as vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Defensive artillery positions have been established.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as Ukraine this week said it might negotiate with Russia on Crimea &amp;#8211; but only if it advances to the borders of the peninsula, a massive advance from its current positions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hardline chairman of Russian parliament’s international affairs committee Leonid Slutsky said: ”The status of Crimea is not subject to discussion at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s an issue that has been decided following the 2014 referendum and has been enshrined in the Russian constitution. The peninsula is forever an inseparable part of Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed Kyiv had “neither the strength nor resources” to grab back Crimea.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yan Gagin, an advisor to the annexed authorities in  Donetsk People’s Republic, dismissed Ukraine’s hopes of reaching Crimea as “empty talk which means absolutely nothing”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are two land routes into Crimea&amp;nbsp;from Ukraine&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; now both reinforced by new recently-built defences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some beaches have been mined, according to Ukrainian sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dictator is facing imminent economic carnage in the annexed peninsula’s once money-spinning tourism industry as people refuse to heed official calls to make “patriotic bookings” this summer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almost every beach in the occupied territory has now &amp;#8211; or will have &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp; giant barricades, with Ukraine claiming that they are also mined by the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin sees Crimea’s illegal annexation in 2014 as one of his greatest achievements, yet there is now paranoia that Ukraine could use Western weapons to grab back a territory larger than Wales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bookings are now 80 per cent down on last year, which, in turn, was 30 per cent below pre-war levels, with hoteliers demanding state bailouts to compensate them for the cost of Putin’s war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourists to the Black Sea have been spooked by the October 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20046489/ukraine-truck-bomb-crimea-bridge/"&gt;bomb attack on Putin’s prized Kerch Strait bridge&lt;/a&gt; linking Crimea to Russia, and missile strikes on military airfields. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drone attacks are now an almost daily event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko said: “Well, that&amp;#8217;s it, here we are &amp;#8211; there will be no beach season in Crimea this year….&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All the beaches of the Russian-occupied peninsula will be turned into a coastal defence line and mined.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin’s puppet leader in Crimea, hardliner Sergey Aksyonov, told Russian state TV that “thanks to the measures taken on behalf of our President, nothing threatens Crimea”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He urged Russian tourists not to be put off by “fake information” on safety which he blamed on Ukrainian officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet the peninsula’s main airport has been closed for 13 months and Aksyonov’s war rhetoric is unlikely to encourage tourists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a large number of people working on [securing the beaches],” he said, stressing that the defences were on Putin’s orders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you want peace, prepare for the war &amp;#8211; so we better be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He refused to give “all details” on the defences but boasted there was  “no way with new fortification lines that Ukraine can ever take Crimea &amp;#8211; the only real danger is drones.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978874" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 10px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="3112" height="2251" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/crimea-preparing-beach-season-digging-808437459.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978874" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trenches along the coastline in annexed Crimea[/caption]

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JAILED journalist Evan Gershkovich has categorically denied all accusations against him after being charged with espionage in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The well-respected Wall Street Journal reporter, 31, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21882048/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-arrest-russia/"&gt;was seized by secret police on spying charges&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978437" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wall-street-journal-journalist-evan-808451129.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978437" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Evan Gershkovich has been charged with espionage in Russia[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978440" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-u-s-secretary-state-808013497.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978440" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The US-born reporter was detained by Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s FSB last week[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;But Putin&amp;#8217;s spies have offered no evidence to support the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WSJ has vehemently denied the charges and published an article on how &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-cd03b0f3"&gt;the country he loved had turned against him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His arrest was also strongly condemned by journalists globally who have been showing their support with the hashtag #IStandWithEvan on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Russian investigators have now formally charged Mr Gershkovich, alleging he carried out espionage in the interests of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Gershkovich has categorically denied the charges, TASS news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A source said: &amp;#8220;He categorically denied all the accusations and stated that he was engaged in journalistic activities in Russia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920468/us-demands-release-of-wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-in-call-with-sergei-lavrov-after-outrageous-arrest/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said on March 30 that it had detained the US reporter in the city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against him for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;US President Biden and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21930322/rishi-sunak-evan-gershkovich-russia-arrest/"&gt;PM Rishi Sunak&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21930533/evan-gershkovich-jailed-russia-uk-govt/"&gt;called for his immediate release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And MPs have warned Mr Gershkovich is a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21941571/evan-gershkovich-victim-putin-hostage/"&gt;victim of &amp;#8220;state hostage taking&amp;#8221; &lt;/a&gt;designed to castrate US foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Gershkovich, described as a &amp;#8220;esteemed, principled journalist&amp;#8221;, is the first reporter for an American news outlet to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5815267/cold-war-definition-what-is-it-origins/"&gt;Cold War.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journalist was reportedly held at a restaurant and bundled into a car by plain-clothed officers with a sweater pulled over his head.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He later appeared in court in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://the-sun.com/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, where he pleaded not guilty to espionage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Gershkovich was seen being led into a van by guards from the Lefortovsky court in the Russian capital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr Gershkovich is a US citizen whose parents fled the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has lived in Moscow for six years working as a journalist and joined the WSJ in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WSJ Editor in Chief Emma Tucker described Mr Gershkovich&amp;#8217;s arrest as &amp;#8220;completely unjust&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in newsgathering. Any suggestions otherwise are false.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;His sole purpose in his work is to capture issues occurring around the world and to shed light on them so that the public can make informed decisions about how to navigate the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We continue to call for his immediate release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The unjust arrest of one of our own sits heavy with all of us, and I know for many there are lingering questions about what the Russian government’s actions mean for freedom of the press in the region.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After relocating to Russia, Mr Gershkovich won awards for his work at The Moscow Times before joining the Agence France-Presse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After joining WSJ early in 2022, he travelled to the Belarus-Ukraine border as Russia invaded Ukraine, making him the only US reporter who could see the first injured Russian forces being taken home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A DAD has been left distraught after his two British daughters were killed in a suspected terror attack in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victims &amp;#8211; a 15-year-old girl and a woman in her 20s &amp;#8211; died at the scene after their car was ambushed by gunmen then rammed by another vehicle in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21978371" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/israeli-security-forces-examine-scene-808414700.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21978371" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A 15-year-old girl and a woman, 21, were shot dead[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Their mother, 48, was also seriously injured when their car was attacked near the Hamra settlement, about 30 miles north of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family is understood to have moved from the UK to Israel in 2005 and settled in Efrat, near the Palestinian city of Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was believed to be a cowardly and indiscriminate revenge strike launched as tensions spiralled following police raids on the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gunmen are believed to have targeted the car simply because it bore Israeli registration plates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A US national was also recently shot dead in similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sisters were in a car that came under fire and was then rammed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures showed white and red cars with serious front end damage following what appeared to be a high speed collision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sisters died at the scene and their mother was airlifted to hospital in a &amp;#8220;very critical condition&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sources in Israel confirmed that the sisters were both originally from London and were aged 15 and 21.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their father &amp;#8211; who attended university in the UK &amp;#8211; had been in a separate car travelling ahead of the women but realised there had been an altercation behind him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He drove back to the scene fearing his family had been involved in a traffic accident then realised the car had come under fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police later reported the vehicle in which the British family was travelling had been riddled with a volley of 22 Kalashnikov assault rifle bullets, leaving blood spattered on the windscreen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distraught dad &amp;#8211; who has not been identified &amp;#8211; was being comforted by family members and friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said its medics initially responded to a vehicle collision on the Route 57 highway in the northern Jordan Valley, near the Hamra Junction, close to the settlement of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When medics and troops reached the scene, the car was found to be riddled with bullet holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambulencemen said two women were declared dead at the scene, and a woman who was critically hurt in the attack was taken to Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital in Jerusalem by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors said she had suffered bullet wounds to her upper body and confirmed she remained “critical”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Force said the shooting was a terror attack and had launched a manhunt for the gunmen and other suspects who fled the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A military spokesman said: “IDF forces are blocking roads in the area and have begun a pursuit of the terrorists.”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mayor of the Efrat settlement, Oded Revivi confirmed the two dead women were sisters, and their mother was the third victim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said the father had been driving a separate car ahead of the rest of the family, and turned around following the attack and saw medics tending his wife and fatally wounded daughters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial investigations suggested the gunmen first opened fire at the Israeli-owned car before it crashed into the highway’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The terrorists then opened fire at the car again, killing two of the occupants and critically wounding the third.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Troops combing the area later found 22 7.62mm shell casings, typically used in rifles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surveillance camera footage showed the terrorists driving up to the victims’ car, with one man opening fire from the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The car with the gunmen then made a U-turn on the highway and fled the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A foreign office spokeswoman said: &amp;#8220;We are saddened to hear about the deaths of two British-Israeli citizens and the serious injuries sustained by a third individual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The UK calls for all parties across the region to de-escalate tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE woman who said she believed she was Madeleine McCann has posed as a missing child THREE times before, it&amp;#8217;s been claimed today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21808585/who-julia-wendell-madeleine-mccann/"&gt;Julia Wandelt, 21&lt;/a&gt;, told the world she was the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/madeleine-mccann/page/4/"&gt;three-year-old who vanished in 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977663" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 490px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/julia-wandelt-polish-girl-thinks-803524649.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=480" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977663" width="480" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Dr Fia Johansson&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Julia Wendell said she believed she was Madeleine McCann[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977662" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/undated-family-photo-shows-madeleine-730353821-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977662" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Madeleine McCann vanished from her parents&amp;#8217; holiday apartment in Praia de Luz in 2007 aged three[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Julia shocked the world when a video of her &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7629710/who-is-julia-faustyna-madeleine-mccann/"&gt;claiming to be the youngster&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; taken from her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8640677/where-praia-da-luz-holiday-madeleine-mccann/"&gt;Praia de Luz&lt;/a&gt; apartment during a family holiday &amp;#8211; went viral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In it, Julia &amp;#8211; who also uses the surnames Wendell and Faustyna &amp;#8211; claimed she couldn&amp;#8217;t remember early parts of her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/children/"&gt;childhood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She even claimed she &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7685734/im-facial-expert-proof-woman-isnt-maddie/"&gt;had no birth certificate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But after weeks of speculation, Canadian &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21905072/woman-believes-she-madeleine-mccann-dna-test-results/"&gt;DNA tests proved she was not Maddie&lt;/a&gt; as she did not have any English heritage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a childhood pal speaking to &lt;a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11949295/Sinister-world-Maddie-McCann-faker-Polish-woman-middle-class-family.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"&gt;MailOnline&lt;/a&gt; has revealed Julia is &amp;#8220;mixed up&amp;#8221; and the Maddy claim saga is her fourth missing person story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The friend explained: &amp;#8220;When she was in her mid-teens she started to say that Dorota wasn&amp;#8217;t her mother and that she was really a child who had gone missing in Poland a few years earlier.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MailOnline also revealed Julia claimed to be missing German schoolgirl Inga Gehricke, five, who vanished in Stendal in 2015 &amp;#8211; she even sent pictures to a Polish charity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She later claimed to be missing 19-month old Acacia Bishop, who vanished in Utah, USA, in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both claims were dismissed as her age didn&amp;#8217;t add up and it later emerged she made the Inga story up with her friend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Julia is in fact the privately educated daughter of wealthy middle class parents from the south-west Polish city of Wroclav.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A family friend told MailOnline mum Dorota is &amp;#8220;beside herself&amp;#8221; following Julia&amp;#8217;s antics adding how she is desperate to get her daughter &amp;#8220;the help she needs&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Julia has near 100 per cent Polish heritage, zero British or even Germany ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the DNA results, Julia said: &amp;#8220;I have to say I never said I am Madeleine. I always said that I believe I could be Madeleine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A TEN-year-old girl was found dead in her room at a children&amp;#8217;s home in Germany as police are investigating the involvement of an 11-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The girl tragically died at a child and youth welfare facility in Wunsiedel, in the Bavaria region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977506" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/police-patrol-car-blocks-off-807998533.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977506" width="960" height="639" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Avalon.red&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The girl was found dead in her room at a care center in Germany[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977499" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/minister-state-family-affairs-labor-808442654.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977499" width="960" height="639" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;PA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Minister of State for Family Affairs, Labor and Social Affairs Ulrike Scharf at the child and youth welfare center[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Evidence collected at the crime scene &amp;#8220;indicates the involvement of an 11-year-old boy&amp;#8221; staying at the same facility, local police and prosecutors said in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since the 11-year-old boy is below the age of criminal responsibility, he has been placed in a secure facility as a preventive measure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police and prosecutors declined to give further details on the Wunsiedel case but said the boy had not yet been questioned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They added that they were coordinating closely with local youth authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bavaria&amp;#8217;s regional interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, praised the investigators for identifying a suspect &amp;#8220;in a relatively short amount of time&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s important now is to clarify the exact circumstances of this tragedy,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The child and youth welfare centre in the small town of Wunsiedel, home to around 90 children and teenagers, said it was &amp;#8220;deeply shocked&amp;#8221; by the girl&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with the parents, the family, our children and our colleagues,&amp;#8221; it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On its website, the institute describes itself as supporting &amp;#8220;young people and their families who need help with their upbringing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;POPE Francis is set to miss Good Friday&amp;#8217;s late-night procession for the first time since he got elected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old who was recently &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21878865/pope-francis-respiratory-infection-hospital-vatican/"&gt;hospitalised with a respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#8217;t preside over Good Friday&amp;#8217;s late-night Way of the Cross event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977066" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pope-francis-lead-chrism-mass-808243765.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977066" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;The Mega Agency&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The Pope was admitted to hospital last week[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21977070" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 903px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bcef2733-e8db-42ad-b00e-9c1ba0ae0c9b.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=893" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21977070" width="893" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Francis, 86 suffered from a respiratory infection&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Rex&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vatican said in a statement that instead of presiding over the torch-lit procession at the Colosseum, Francis will watch from the hotel where he lives in the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Pope will miss the procession due to Rome&amp;#8217;s cold weather, the Vatican added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He will still attend the earlier Passion of the Lord celebration at St. Peter&amp;#8217;s Basilica. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There, the cross will be unveiled before it goes to the Colosseum for the procession.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Francis, 86, was discharged from a Rome hospital on Saturday following treatment for bronchitis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vatican said at the time that he would carry out the complete Holy Week schedule, including the Way of the Cross procession and Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peters Square.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, he presided over Mass in St. Peters Basilica and later washed and dried the feet of a dozen residents of a Rome juvenile prison in a ritual symbolizing humility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Pope was rushed to hospital by ambulance after his weekly audience last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the Pope had been struggling with breathing difficulties and was taken to the Gemelli hospital for tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said Pope Francis is &amp;#8220;touched by the many messages received and expresses his gratitude for the closeness and prayer&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Francis&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20956235/pope-francis-pope-benedict-funeral/"&gt;bid farewell to his predecessor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died aged 95.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Francis was seen arriving in a wheelchair and stood using a stick as he paid tribute to the &amp;#8220;wisdom, tenderness and devotion that he bestowed upon us over the years&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Gemelli is the same hospital where he underwent a major op on his colon in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He remained in hospital for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis had to cancel activities several times last year due to the pain his knee and acknowledged that he needed to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he would follow Benedict in stepping down if his health made him unable to do his job.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FORMER Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has broken his silence from his hospital bed after he was diagnosed with blood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old media mogul who has &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21960210/silvio-berlusconi-cancer-italy-leukaemia/"&gt;spent three nights in intensive care with pneumonia &lt;/a&gt;after a diagnosis of leukaemia told his fans he believes he will recover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21976768" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/forza-italia-leader-former-prime-782859881.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21976768" width="960" height="643" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The former PM was diagnosed with blood cancer[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21976793" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/general-view-intensive-care-unit-808029474-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21976793" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He has spent three nights in intensive care at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s tough, but I&amp;#8217;ll make it once again,&amp;#8221; he told Italian Il Giornales from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/milan/"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s San Raffaele Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I managed, also in delicate and difficult situations, to pull myself up, &amp;#8220;he told the newspaper in a phone call from his hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was admitted to hospital with heart problems and shortness of breath on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is reported his condition is serious but stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A bulletin released by his doctors, states that his current treatment aims to tackle the pulmonary infection as well as limit the negative effects of chronic leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, said that Berlusconi was alert and was responding to the treatments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former Prime Minister is the leader of the Forza Italia party which makes up part of Italy&amp;#8217;s ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/"&gt;Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; who is worth an estimated $7billion &amp;#8211; however currently does not have a role in government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said: &amp;#8220;Sincere and affectionate wishes for a speedy recovery to Silvio Berlusconi. Forza Silvio.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served as Prime Minister of Italy on three occasions, from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/"&gt;Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;reportedly spent four days at the same hospital last week for treatment, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2023/04/05/berlusconi-nuovamente-ricoverato-al-san-raffaele_2e860e53-a9a7-4952-b9b6-2d62f4661e91.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;news agency Ansa.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The politician shared a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;thanking people for their concern alongside a snap of him smiling at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi wrote: &amp;#8220;I have already returned to work on the main themes of these days, ready and determined to commit myself, as I always have, to the country I love.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire&amp;#8217;s latest hospital dash comes after a series of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;scares in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was hospitalised for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;-related pneumonia in September 2020, but later recovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the following year he was admitted several times for complications stemming from the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was forced to undergo open heart surgery in 2016 and surgery on his intestine three years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four-time prime minister, who is fitted with a pacemaker, has also overcome&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prostate-cancer/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his time in office hasn&amp;#8217;t been without controversy, as the party-loving former leader is well known for his sex scandals and eyebrow-raising jokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi &amp;#8211; who is in a relationship with Forza Italia MP Marta Fascina, 33 &amp;#8211; allegedly held lavish &amp;#8220;Bunga Bunga&amp;#8221; bashes at his villa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was accused, but later acquitted, of paying young women for &amp;#8220;silence and lies&amp;#8221; surrounding the infamous gatherings, which he always insisted were simply elegant dinners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But guests claimed they were in fact wild sex parties with &amp;#8220;orgies&amp;#8221;, where women stripped and performed &amp;#8220;raunchy pole dances&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;PLAYBOY PM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ex-PM, who previously described himself as the &amp;#8220;Jesus Christ of politics&amp;#8221;, also landed himself in hot water in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was alleged that the lothario had abused his position of power to protect a young Moroccan nightclub dancer who was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police detained Karima El-Mahroug, known by her stage name &amp;#8216;Ruby the Heart Stealer&amp;#8217;, for theft &amp;#8211; but she was released after Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was charged with paying her for sex when she was just 17 and was found guilty until he was acquitted in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An appeals court ruled there was no proof he knew El-Mahroug was a minor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was also temporarily banned from politics after a conviction of tax fraud in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served a community sentence and muscled his way back into the spotlight before being re-elected as a senator in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi proved old habits died hard last year after promising his Monza players a &amp;#8220;bus full of prostitutes&amp;#8221; if they beat AC Milan or Juventus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old, who owned&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1302934/ac-milan/"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;between 1986 and 2017,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7371758/ac-milan-silvio-berlusconi-serie-c-monza/"&gt;bought the team in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21976828" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3153ab3d-f0fa-4f76-ba96-96c20ec6c5a3.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21976828" width="960" height="853" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Berlusconi is the leader of the Forza Italia party&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP:Associated Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A SELF-MADE millionaire has shared her simple tips for building wealth but warned you &amp;#8220;won&amp;#8217;t ever save your way to being rich&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tess B. Jelten, a 25-year-old from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/arizona/"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, has built her fortune through social media and building her own brand as &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;Tiktok&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;rich big sister&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21976750" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/won-t-ever-save-way-808423200.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21976750" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram/@tessaabellaa&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Tessa B. gives financial advice on her TikTok and social media platforms[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21976749" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/won-t-ever-save-way-808423283.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21976749" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram/@tessaabellaa&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She advises looking at your savings, active income and passive income in order to become rich[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She shared advice on her platforms and says often people believe that cutting back or budgeting will help them get rich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on her TikTok channel@billiondollarbella, she said: &amp;#8220;Unfortunately that couldn&amp;#8217;t be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Now those things are definitely important to do but it&amp;#8217;s not gonna make you rich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The key to being truly wealthy is having active income in excess to fill up your savings and then to turn that active income into passive income streams.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tessa B., who describes herself as a &amp;#8220;business girlie&amp;#8221;, shared simple tips on what people should focus on if they really want to get rich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She described three main pillars that wannabe millionaires look to improve if they want to rake the big bucks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking on TikTok she said: &amp;#8220;First is your savings, second is your active income and investments and the third is going to be passive income and automation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;First things first with your savings, I have to tell you the most important quote that changed my life, your never going to save your way to rich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What I mean by this is if you&amp;#8217;re at a certain income right now, just saving more money and cutting out certain expenses is not going to make you wealthy.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She says the savvy savers should have a &amp;#8220;nest egg&amp;#8221; which she suggests should be around three to six months of their current living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she warns not to put those savings into a traditional bank account but into a high-yield savings account. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then she advises her followers to put all their expenses onto credit cards whilst paying them off every single month and keeping the utilization below 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In return, savers will build credit while earning rewards such as travel points or cashback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She then looks at active incomes and investments, anything that &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re trading your time in exchange for money&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;For most of you this is gonna be your traditional job or if you&amp;#8217;ve already started to pursue adding in some additional side hustles&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I would highly suggest looking at ways that can increase your active income, so if you&amp;#8217;re currently at a job, find ways to ask for a raise or if there&amp;#8217;s additional work you can pick up.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;In addition to that find ways that you can layer on other sources of active income.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example, she suggests those working in marketing could sign up one-off social media clients using strategies that they have learned in their corporate job. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her Tiktok page, with over 43,000 followers, is full of financial tips on how you can bolster your savings, increase your income or start a new side hustle. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her followers have flooded her videos with adoring comments, with one adding: &amp;#8220;Thank you for taking the time to do this! This was so precise. I was nodding my head at every word.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another said: &amp;#8220;This is a great video for people who aren’t familiar with these tips.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While one commented: &amp;#8220;Yo this is actually very good information thanks for sharing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MYSTERY surrounds the death of a British tourist who was found dead lying face down in a sewer in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Charlie Gray, 30, was discovered by horrified locals in a remote area in the Kampot province, around 90 miles from the capital Phnom Penh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21975759" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/D9H4E9jpg-JS808415288.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="D9H4E9 Landscape in the Kampot Province, Cambodia" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21975759" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The man&amp;#8217;s body was found in a remote area in Kampot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police arrived shortly after he was found at around 4 pm local time on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man, from Bristol, was pronounced dead at the scene and his body was taken away for a police post-mortem examination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A local named Bong Chea, who was one of the people who found the body, said: &amp;#8220;The man was dead when we found him. Somebody moved him to check if he was alive and try and wake him up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He was already dead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Nobody knows how he fell into the sewer. We also don&amp;#8217;t know who the man was. We hardly see foreigners in this area.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police believe the victim could have fallen face down into the sewer and drowned from swallowing the shallow water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, an officer said today that his body could have been dumped in the ditch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are now waiting for the results from his dead body to find the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officers from the Krong Kampot district station said the body was currently at the Wat Teuk Thla temple in Phnom Penh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Seang said: &amp;#8220;The autopsy results will show how the foreigner died. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If they show there was foul play, yes, we will investigate this further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He could have fallen into the sewer and died. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s possible he died somewhere else and his body was left at the sewer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An FCDO spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who died in Cambodia, and are in touch with the local authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A BEAUTIFUL cottage dubbed the &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8217;s loneliest house&amp;#8221; is perfect for those looking for some peace as the closest neighbour is miles away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tiny white house has been branded &amp;#8220;magical&amp;#8221; as it is surrounded by stunning valley views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21975081" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/exwkm4-achnambeithach-cottage-near-loch-808408146.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21975081" width="960" height="641" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Alamy&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The tiny property is located in Glencoe[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21974818" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/peace-heaven-worlds-loneliest-house-808405607.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21974818" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The cottage is next to the Loch Achtriochtan[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21975112" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/j04f7w-small-bridge-crosses-river-808408148.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21975112" width="960" height="578" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Alamy&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The closest neighbour is miles away[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;A secluded property in the Scottish islands, the Achnambeithach Cottage is located in Glencoe near Loch Achtriochtan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two-bedroom cottage is said to be dating back to 1900. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there are other secluded properties in the Highlands, none of them is as remote as the Achnambeithach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiktokers were left stunned by the region&amp;#8217;s breathtaking views with one saying: &amp;#8220;I envy the person who lives in that house.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Scotland is magical.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone said: &amp;#8220;WILD&amp;#8230;I had a dream I lived in a cottage at the base of rocky hills &amp;amp; you had to cross a bridge to get there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is literally my dream cottage.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone else wrote: &amp;#8220;that would be well nice to live there the scenery is amazing just Scotland’s amazing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another lonely house has been &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13469602/world-loneliest-house-deserted-island-iceland-zombie/"&gt;sitting empty on a small deserted&lt;/a&gt; island for nearly 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The single white building of a green hill on Elliðaey – a tiny island south of Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile,  Skiddaw House in Cumbria is only accessible by foot, has no electricity or internet and is &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/21769069/inside-uks-loneliest-house-cut-off-from-world/"&gt;ideal for anyone looking to escape the real world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a one-bedroom home is up for grabs for £260,000 &amp;#8211; and it comes with its&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18274926/inside-worlds-loneliest-home/"&gt; own deserted island.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The isolated dwelling, built in 2009, sits on Wohoa Bay in Washington County, Maine,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-states/"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, with outstanding views of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CLASSIFIED US intelligence documents revealing Ukraine&amp;#8217;s plans ahead of a planned spring offensive against Russia have been leaked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The top secret military documents that contained details of US and Nato plans to help Ukraine prepare, were shared on Twitter and on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21974025" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ukrainian-soldier-fires-howitzer-russian-808345458.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21974025" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The documents revealed Ukraine&amp;#8217;s plans ahead of a spring offensive[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has launched an investigation into who may be behind the leak of the documents, the &lt;a aria-label="New York Times (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/politics/ukraine-war-plan-russia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are aware of the reports of social media posts, and the Department is reviewing the matter,&amp;#8221; Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The documents reportedly contain charts and details about weapons deliveries, battalion strengths and other sensitive information, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Information in the documents is at least five weeks old, with the most recent dated March 1, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the documents summarised the training schedules of 12 Ukraine combat brigades, and said nine of them were being trained by US and NATO forces, and needed 250 tanks and more than 350 mechanized vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The documents-at least one of which carried a &amp;#8220;top secret&amp;#8221; label &amp;#8211; were circulated on pro-Russian government channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Information in the documents also details expenditure rates for munitions under Ukraine military control, including for the HIMARS rocket systems, the US-made artillery rocket systems that have proven highly effective against Russian forces, it added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report quoted military analysts who warned that some documents appear to have been altered in a disinformation campaign by Russia, in one document inflating Ukrainian troop deaths and minimising Russian battlefield losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The documents that Biden officials has been trying to delete, do not contain any specific details about the time, or the location of Ukraine&amp;#8217;s spring offensive- with American officials estimating it will be in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysts said on Friday it&amp;#8217;d be difficult to access  the impact of the leak on the frontline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the documents ended up on social media- military analysts said they have been shared by pro-Russian government channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However experts have warned to be wary as the documents could have been released by Russian sources to spread misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA told the newspaper: &amp;#8220;Whether these documents are authentic or not, people should take care with anything released by Russian sources.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But analysts said that parts of the documents appeared authentic and would provide Russia with valuable information such as delivery of weapons and troops and other military details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the battle continues in the city of of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has captured the west bank of the Bakhmutka River, threatening a  key supply route for Ukrainian forces to the west, according to British intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The British defence ministry said in a statement: &amp;#8220;In recent days, Russian forces have regained some momentum in the battle for Bakhmut. Since late March 2023 their advance had largely stalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Russia has made further gains and has now highly likely advanced into the town centre, and has seized the west bank of the Bakhmutka River. Ukraine&amp;#8217;s key 0506 supply route to the west of the town is likely severely threatened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Russian regular forces, likely including airborne troops, have probably reinforced the area, and Russia is again using artillery more effectively in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There is realistic possibility that, locally, Wagner and Russian MoD commanders have paused their ongoing feud and improved co-operation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt; A STUNNING female roofer who can lift as much as men says she is inundated with job offers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Influencer Vilma Honkonen has showed off her skills on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; sharing clips where she lifts 25kgs without a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973605" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 369px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-302.png?strip=all&amp;amp;w=359" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973605" width="359" height="573" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Tiktoker works as a roofer&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973694" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384971.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973694" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She says she can lift as much as a man[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973613" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 366px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-304.png?strip=all&amp;amp;w=356" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973613" width="356" height="543" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Vilma got into roofing after she was trained by her dad&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973705" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384768.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973705" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vilma also shares snaps of herself outside of work[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The pretty blond who is a former beautician, often shares insights of her job with her followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The videos show that her job as a roofer requires a lot of physical activity- with her lifting quite heavy weights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old who says she changed profession thanks to her dad admits that she has &amp;#8220;two different personalities,&amp;#8221;  the work one and the glam one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She often shares snaps of her self dressed up and with a full face of makeup but also shares videos of her in her work uniform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers can&amp;#8217;t get enough of her videos with many inviting her to join their companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One said: &amp;#8220;come work in the Netherlands!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone wrote: &amp;#8220;sweden has alot metalroof workers!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While someone commented:&amp;#8221; I have been roofing since 09 and I have only seen 2 females in the trade before, and they can&amp;#8217;t lift rolls like you can, good for you girl.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile another TikToker who works as a&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7783537/female-carpenter-in-bikini-blokes-love-my-work/"&gt; carpenter and enjoys doing her woodwork in a bikini &lt;/a&gt;says blokes love to watch her work for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HardWoodBunny has adopted the persona of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7289366/female-carpenter-bikinis-furniture/"&gt;the &amp;#8220;Bikini Carpenter&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; to promote her business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her latest clip she filmed herself laying the framework for some outdoor decking in the sunshine while donning a sports bra and tight gym shorts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973697" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384968.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973697" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The Tiktoker says she loves both of her personalities[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973711" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/im-flooded-offers-men-join-808384795-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973711" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She posts videos in her normal clothes and in her work uniform[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;VLADIMIR Putin is becoming increasingly isolated, paranoid and lost touch with the outside world &amp;#8211; even has sends Russians to die in the mud in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian defector Gleb Karakulov, who served on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;security services, offered a chilling insight into Vlad&amp;#8217;s mind this week &amp;#8211; describing the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; president as living in a &amp;#8220;cocoon&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_20905107" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/russian-president-vladimir-putin-gestures-784517661.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-20905107" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s world is these days believed to be one of isolation[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21935894/putin-hides-in-bunkers-dodge-assassination-terrified-of-covid/"&gt;Karakulov described how Vlad&lt;/a&gt; is sped between his various &amp;#8220;bunker&amp;#8221; residences on a network of armoured trains &amp;#8211; almost totally detached from the world outside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life. He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum,&amp;#8221; the defector told the &lt;a href="https://dossier.center/fso/"&gt;Dossier Centre&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a unique and rare first hand insight into the deeply twisted mindset of a world leader who has had near absolute power for more than 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it is further paints the picture of Putin as an acutely strange individual who appears to be living in a nightmare of his own making, where very little is true and everyone is out to get him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad&amp;#8217;s inner circle is small &amp;#8211; with him having very few close confidantes, beyond figures like his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/"&gt;mistress Alina Kabaeva&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21823223/putin-ally-medvedev-warns-nuclear-war-us-russia/"&gt;stooge Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin, 70, is believed to be obsessed with his own death &amp;#8211; both from possible illness or from the knife of assassins. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the long-reported linchpins of Putin&amp;#8217;s personality has been his deep-seated fear that he could be &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18910482/vladimir-putin-killed-gaddafi-russia/"&gt;killed like Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; with the Libyan tyrant being overthrown and murdered in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad is claimed to have obsessively watched mobile phone footage of him being pulled out of a storm drain before being manhandled by an angry crowd, sodomised with a bayonet, and shot dead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It appears to have been a turning point for Putin &amp;#8211; fuelling the deep-seated paranoia of the man raised in the Soviet Union and the KGB.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov that Putin&amp;#8217;s fear of death is so severe that he has replica offices dotted across Russia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad wants to make sure his enemies can never know his position &amp;#8211; making sure they can never come for him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And subsequently, there are various unverified claims that during the war Putin has used body doubles to appear in certain locations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials have claimed Vlad is using three such men to carry out duties on his behalf &amp;#8211; but no one knows for sure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin himself has previously been forced to deny that he uses body doubles &amp;#8211; but did claim he was once offered them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov explained there is a virtual &amp;#8220;state-within-a-state&amp;#8221; that looks after Putin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this inner bubble just further deepens his isolation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s fear of death apparently was worsened by the Covid pandemic &amp;#8211; and the bodyguard says his lifestyle has altered significantly since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad was once eager to be seen as the world&amp;#8217;s number one strongman and to trot the world stage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was famously pictured hunting, riding horses, playing with his dogs, swimming with dolphins, playing hockey, doing judo and various other macho stunts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet now, when he is seen &amp;#8211; Vlad is normally sat behind a screen or keeps several dozen feet away from his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21968830" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-136334127jpg-JS722740021.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin rides a horse during his vacation outside the town of Kyzyl in Southern Siberia on August 3, 2009.

&lt;figure id="attachment_18438078" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 643px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000018996252.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=633" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-18438078" width="633" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s inner circle is small &amp;#8211; including figures such as his lover Alina Kabaeva&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures released this week showed the absurd moment he welcomed a new selection of ambassadors to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet in the pictures, he stood around &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21955936/putin-speaks-ambassadors-away-cancer-parkinsons/"&gt;60 feet away from them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His fear of death seems to have morphed into a germaphobia &amp;#8211; especially when it comes to Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov claimed Putin makes staff quarantine for two weeks before meetings as the tyrant quakes in fear of disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin once snapped at a coughing minister during a meeting, raging &amp;#8220;getting the flu is self-harm. You could have prevented it, but you didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;American psychologist Frederick Coolidge previously described Putin&amp;#8217;s increased isolationism, health fears and paranoia as typical of tyrants &amp;#8211; comparing him to Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[Autocrats] tend to have an excessive fear of death or infection,&amp;#8221; he told the &lt;a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/covid-19-pandemic_putin-bismarck-autocrats-fear-germs/6191402.html"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They fear losing control, they fear losing everything and have a need to control everything. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And they are not always rational about it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And meanwhile, it&amp;#8217;s been reported that Putin has increasingly questioned how &amp;#8220;loyal&amp;#8221; his government is over the war in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian newspaper Vedomosti&amp;nbsp;reported that week that some 33,000 Russian officials have been weeded out due to &amp;#8220;opposition sentiments&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these cases were down to &amp;#8220;offenses&amp;#8221; involving social media since the start of the war last February. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And hardline figures in Russia are also gaining prominence thanks to the war, such as Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin is understood to distrust his once close ally Prigozhin  &amp;#8211; and may now be attempting to set them up to fail in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this storm of paranoia and infighting is on top of rumours Putin is batting several health issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speculation is fuelled by his often &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/"&gt;bloated look&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/"&gt;twitching feet&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; with long-running rumours he is suffering from Parkinson&amp;#8217;s or even cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as with much information about Putin &amp;#8211; most of this is down to rumours and speculation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And his increasing isolation is making these reports harder to verify. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov provided the world with some of the best insight yet into Vlad. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our president has lost touch with the world,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has been living in an information cocoon for the past couple of years, spending most of his time in his residences, which the media very fittingly call bunkers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life. He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He only values his own life and the lives of his family and friends.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad hasn&amp;#8217;t made the gains he or his commanders expected and Russia has found itself bogged down in a long, brutal war as humiliating defeats pile up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tyrant now seemingly has his future tied to his success or failure in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin foolishly believed his forces would be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators when he invaded last February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead, the initial attack ended in a disaster which saw his forces devastated and thrown back to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kyiv continues to call for Western support to help them defeat Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world is now awaiting to see if&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21907573/ukraine-tanks-challenger-2-bloodiest-battle/"&gt;Ukraine will mount its long expected counter offensive&lt;/a&gt;, with much of the fiercest fighting currently centred around the city of Bakhmut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21968881" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/f97166ee-02f3-4861-842d-ebab31fcffa3.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21968881" width="960" height="820" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Putin welcomes Russia&amp;#8217;s new ambassadors from 60ft away due to &amp;#8216;sanitary restrictions&amp;#8217;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FOUR people were killed in a horror car crash during the Easter weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tragic accident left survivors trapped in their vehicles with emergency services having to cut them from the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973305" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/45am-friday-morning-reports-crash-808372290.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973305" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;OnScene ACT&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;One person is fighting for their life following the collision[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973312" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/45am-friday-morning-reports-crash-808372252.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973312" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;OnScene ACT&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Emergency services rushed to the scene in Jeir[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973308" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/45am-friday-morning-reports-crash-808372416.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973308" width="960" height="641" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;OnScene ACT&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Four people were killed after the crash[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;A survivor has been left fighting for his life in hospital after the two-car crash at Jeir in New South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police were called to the Barton Highway following reports of a crash involving a Ford Ranger and a Mitsubishi Triton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambulance crews and a rescue helicopter rushed to the scene where they found people trapped in their vehicles following the collision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police confirmed that a 52-year-old woman and a 54-year-old male passenger, as well as two men in their 20s, died at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victims have not been formally identified, a statement from NSW Police states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NSW Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander, Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said: &amp;#8216;Two cars with multiple deceased is no doubt a scene that is horrific but ultimately our thoughts are with the family, friends and local community that will no doubt will feel the impact of these deaths.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A male passenger of the Ford, believed to be in his 20s, was treated at the scene and later taken to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is understood he is in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survivors of the horrific crash had to be cut out from the wreckage by NSW Fire and Rescue after they were trapped in their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police have set up a crime scene as they launch an investigation into the crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops urge anyone with dashcam footage or any other information to contact Crime Stoppers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FRENCH president Emmanuel Macron stands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing — amid accusations he is now a puppet of the Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The French President and EU chief &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ursula-von-der-leyen/"&gt;Ursula Von Der Leyen&lt;/a&gt; had the red carpet rolled out by the rogue nation, where they took part in business discussions and posed up for photos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21972210" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/french-counterpart-emmanuel-macron-review-808163816.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21972210" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;French president Emmanuel Macron stands with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing — amid accusations he is now a puppet of the Asian nation[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/emmanuel-macron/"&gt;Mr Macron&lt;/a&gt; used the visit to urge his Chinese counterpart, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/xi-jinping/"&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/a&gt; to help stop &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; which he has refused to condemn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said last night: &amp;#8220;I know I can count on you to bring &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/page/3/"&gt;Russia &lt;/a&gt;back to its senses and everyone back to the negotiating table.&amp;#8221; The tense visit comes after years of deteriorating relations between the West and China over human rights abuses cosying up to other rogue states like Iran and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Xi visited Russia for a full three-day state visit just last month in a show of support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But European leaders are attempting to engage with China, with similar trips from Germany and Spain in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MPs called out the Chinese President&amp;#8217;s fake attempts to be a peacemaker &amp;#8211; saying the dictator was just using him for its own gains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Alicia Kearns, said his summit would make no difference to helping end the brutal war, after his similar peace talks with Putin failed last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;Over a year ago, Macron met with Putin and then publicly assured allies there would be no renewed illegal invasion. Now he is in Beijing hoping to end Xi’s support of Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Xi does as Xi wills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The CCP will indulge in the propaganda spoils of such a visit, and utilise it to present themselves globally as a peacemaker.&amp;#8221; And furious Iain Duncan Smith said it was another hopeless attempt at &amp;#8220;appeasement&amp;#8221; and showed a total &amp;#8220;failure to understand China&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He raged: &amp;#8220;China is a distinct and dangerous threat to us all &amp;#8211; and Xi&amp;#8217;s so-called peace plan is nothing but a pathetic joke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Macron was slowest out of the blocks on Ukraine a year ago &amp;#8211; under him they would surely broker an appalling peace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All they are doing is kowtowing to China and showing the weakness of the West. &amp;#8220;Is Macron fleeing Paris just to figure out how the Chinese control the crowds?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;STORMY Daniels revealed the moment she broke down in tears amid the uproar over her alleged affair with Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mum-of-one, 44, opened up to &lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/who/piers-morgan"&gt;Piers Morgan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/talk-tv/"&gt;TalkTV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21970040/stormy-daniels-interview-live-piers-morgan-trump/"&gt;an &amp;#8220;astonishing&amp;#8221; interview&lt;/a&gt; after the ex-US President was this week&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21905595/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-indictment-response/"&gt;hauled to court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971897" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 609px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/i-finished-astonishing-90-minute-808145870.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=599" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971897" width="599" height="644" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;piersmorgan/Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Stormy spoke with Piers Morgan for 90 minutes on TalkTV[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971042" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 440px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2006-american-century-celebrity-golf-377920615-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=430" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971042" width="430" height="581" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Refer to caption&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Donald Trump pictured with Stormy Daniels[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971957" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 833px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stormy-daniels-piers-morgan-talk-808272817-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=823" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971957" width="823" height="554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Talk TV&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Stormy said she cries when she thinks about the time she &amp;#8216;lost&amp;#8217; with her daughter[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/donald-trump/"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21946540/donald-trump-america-hell-arrest-charges/"&gt;indicted over accusations&lt;/a&gt; of financial crimes relating to  $130,000 hush money he allegedly paid Stormy in 2016 to keep quiet over claims they had an affair in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sun columnist Piers said he was giving the former porn star a chance to tell her story &amp;#8220;about the fling that may send President Trump to prison&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the 90-minute chat, Stormy told Piers she cries when she thinks about the time she &amp;#8220;lost&amp;#8221; with her daughter as she tried to deal with the storm over the alleged fling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s the one thing that was taken from me that can never be given back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That was time lost with my daughter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I get really upset about it &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s what affects me the most. I&amp;#8217;ll get emotional and cry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy added: &amp;#8220;She didn&amp;#8217;t ask for this. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There are things that I missed because for a long time the only way to keep her safe was to be advertised as being somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I stayed away a lot to protect her, and it worked.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump has decried the case against him as a witch hunt &amp;#8211; claiming it is politically motivated and led by the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He faces&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21945089/president-donald-trump-court-appearance-criminal-charges/"&gt;34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the first degree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy&amp;#8217;s interview with Piers is her first TV interview since Trump&amp;#8217;s arrest on Tuesday, broadcast on TalkTV in the UK and released on streaming service Fox Nation in the US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During their chat, Stormy vowed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21963625/storm-daniels-piers-morgan-talktv-donald-trump/"&gt;she will testify if Trump&amp;#8217;s case goes to trial&lt;/a&gt;, saying she has &amp;#8220;nothing to hide&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You weren’t asked to give evidence to the grand jury, but you may be asked to testify if this ends up as a trial. How do you feel about potentially testifying in a trial that will be watched around the world?&amp;#8221; Piers asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy replied: &amp;#8220;Any time you’re up in the public eye it’s scary. I mean, I used to get scared giving an oral book report in school, so it’s daunting, but I look forward to it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She went on: &amp;#8220;I have nothing to hide. I’m the only one that has been telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And, you know, you can’t shame me even more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So I feel like if they don’t, it paints the picture that they know something about me that makes me you know, untrustworthy, or not reliable.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think having them call me in and put me on the stand legitimises my story and who I am,&amp;#8221; added Stormy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Stormy &amp;#8211; who is a registered Republican but said she did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 &amp;#8211; told Piers that she does not believe he should face jail for his alleged crimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she explained that for other alleged crimes he is under investigation for &amp;#8211; Trump could end up being sent to prison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is currently also under investigation for mishandling government documents, over allegations of fraud, and for attempting to interfere with the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy told Piers: &amp;#8220;I feel like the other things that he has done, if he is found guilty, absolutely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8216;TELL THE TRUTH&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also urged Trump, who she claims got his bodyguard to ask for her phone number, to &amp;#8220;tell the truth&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy added: &amp;#8220;If you continue to do this you are setting a precedent where people think that they won&amp;#8217;t be held accountable and I&amp;#8217;m afraid there are gong to be a lot of people hurt.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She warned if Trump is found guilty of other crimes it could &amp;#8220;open the door for other people to think they can get away with doing that and worse&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of his bombshell court appearance, Trump raged the US is &amp;#8220;going to hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination and will likely take on his nemesis Joe Biden in 2024&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His indictment is seen by many analysts as handing him the ticket &amp;#8211; cauterising his hardline base who may have been turning towards rival Ron DeSantis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is using his legal trouble as a way to rile up his diehard supporters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it remains to be seen how his arrest will play with key swing voters who were turned off by Trump in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy also revealed &amp;#8220;one in ten&amp;#8221; messages she receives are death threats and she wishes she&amp;#8217;d never met Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;They [the messages] would always be from an account somebody created just to do that with no followers, hidden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Now it&amp;#8217;s different, the tone is different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And they are way more specific and graphic. They seem to be more serious in a way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re not hiding &amp;#8211; these people are using their phone numbers, and their actual emails and their actual Twitter accounts &amp;#8211; which then makes it worse because they actually have followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They genuinely feel they are doing something right.&amp;nbsp;It makes you become paranoid.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21964400" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-u-s-president-donald-807822941.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964400" width="960" height="639" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He sits with members of his legal team at the hearing in Manhattan[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964415" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-us-president-donald-trump-807863554-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964415" width="960" height="612" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trump speaks at an event in Mar-a-Lago[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;After returning home to his Mar-a-Lago resort from New York on Tuesday, Trump gave a venomous speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking out to &amp;#8220;God Bless the USA&amp;#8221;, Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case &amp;#8211; calling him &amp;#8220;the real criminal&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He accused Juan Merchan of being a &amp;#8220;Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and said the case against him was &amp;#8220;an insult to our country&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The only crime I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump called for&amp;nbsp;the &amp;#8220;ridiculous&amp;#8221; case to be &amp;#8220;dropped immediately&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he suggested he lost the 2020 US election unfairly &amp;#8220;because our country is going to hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump denies the claim by Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/"&gt;Melania&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; and four months after she gave birth to their son&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2183312/how-tall-barron-trump-height-age/"&gt;Barron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/"&gt;former lawyer Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argue this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he cannot allow &amp;#8220;businesses to cover up criminal conduct&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The historic case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The indictment focused on Trump&amp;#8217;s reimbursement checks to Cohen &amp;#8211; with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="font-weight: bold"&gt;You can watch the full interview on the Piers Morgan Uncensored&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube channel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;TWO young women whip off their tops to cash in on a saucy promotion for a free fairground ride.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a nearby bar, a lad strips totally naked before passing out during a drinking game, while couples snog and grope each other on the dancefloor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970757" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/aerial-view-beach-sunny-beach-808229396.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970757" width="960" height="636" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Stuart Black&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Welcome to Bulgaria’s Sunny Beach — nicknamed Blackpool abroad — where Brit holiday reps are just as wild as the hordes of young tourists from the UK[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970758" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-807805461.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970758" width="960" height="534" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Channel 4&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;As Lanzarote discourages Brits, Amsterdam warns it will jail rowdy visitors and Magaluf tries to clean up its act, Bulgaria is welcoming UK visitors — and their money[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970768" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-supplied-807750017.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970768" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Channel 4&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Viewers will see two Edinburgh fun-seekers, caretaker Demi and student Holly, both 20, take advantage of a fairground slingshot ride which is free to women who go topless[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere cops are helping a pensioner so drunk he has no clue where his hotel is — which turns out to be adjacent to their station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/bulgaria/"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/3364291/heres-why-you-should-visit-bulgarias-sunny-beach-the-cheapest-european-seaside-holiday-this-summer/"&gt;Sunny Beach&lt;/a&gt; — nicknamed Blackpool abroad — where Brit holiday reps are just as wild as the hordes of young tourists from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/21277863/risk-brits-summer-holidays-lanzarote-canary-islands-spain/"&gt;Lanzarote discourages Brits&lt;/a&gt;, Amsterdam warns it will &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/21869784/stag-do-warning-boozy-brits-stay-away-amsterdam/"&gt;jail rowdy visitors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/20374511/brit-tourists-majorca-summer/"&gt;Magaluf tries to clean up its act&lt;/a&gt;, Bulgaria is welcoming UK visitors — and their money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Balkan town of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/web-stories/inside-the-wild-magaluf-of-the-slopes-ski-resort-swamped-with-brits-where-there-are-89p-beers-crazy-parties/"&gt;Bankso&lt;/a&gt;, in the south west, is already overrun with raucous Brits after earning a ­­reputation for cheap booze, parties and affordable ski trips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three hundred miles east at Sunny Beach the scene is just as lively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Every year around 100,000 Brits cause bedlam at the hedonistic resort which has been the cheapest in Europe for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tourists are drawn by 80p pints, bars that sell &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/mens-health-and-fitness/3189669/how-viagra-effects-penis-minute-by-minute/"&gt;Viagra jellies&lt;/a&gt;, and all-you-can-drink nights for just 30 euros (£26) — about the same cost as a hotel room. Revellers can be seen inhaling laughing gas from balloons on the street, as the over-inebriated vomit on pavements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resort is now the subject of new &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/e4/"&gt;E4&lt;/a&gt; docu-series Emergency On Sunny Beach, which over six hour-long episodes from Wednesday will follow local firefighters and medical centre staff trying to cope with the holidaymakers’ crazy antics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=39775&amp;#038;game=polling"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Laughing gas balloons&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viewers will see two Edinburgh fun-seekers, caretaker Demi and student Holly, both 20, take advantage of a fairground slingshot ride which is free to women who go topless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demi’s face is covered in cuts and bruises and she has lost half her front tooth after a drunken fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holly tells the camera crew: “It’s &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/blackpool/"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; but abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pointing at her face, Demi adds: “We’ve only done it to get f***ed up and this is what happens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Lesson learnt: Don’t give anyone a piggyback when you’re drunk, and don’t run when you’re doing it because you’ll have to pay a lot of money. Oh, and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/18796651/travel-insurance-mistakes-thousands-of-pounds/"&gt;take out insurance&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both girls are seen sucking laughing gas from balloons and getting tattoos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demi gets the words “Smoke &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cannabis-legalisation/"&gt;weed &lt;/a&gt;every day” inked in Arabic across her thigh, while Holly gets a butterfly on her tricep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demi says: “I can’t speak Arabic but it’s started a few conversations by the pool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If my family asks, then I’ll just say it says, ‘Live, laugh, love’.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The destination is so riotous that 40 cops are drafted in each summer from other parts of Bulgaria to try to keep a lid on things, while 130 lifeguards patrol the 5km-long beach. The fire service attend ten times as many blazes in summer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Club Viking is the biggest venue in town and holds hook-up nights for singletons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Owner Tsvetan Florov, 30, tells the TV documentary: “The young British lads are like wild animals. People try to have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sex/"&gt;sex &lt;/a&gt;in the club. Someone’s going to be lucky — that’s why we also give away condoms so they can practise safe sex.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mason, 21, from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/essex/"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, on his first lads’ holiday away, has a supply of 20 condoms for ten days. He is seen on bar crawls, downing shots half-naked and licking booze off a Bulgarian girl’s breasts. He takes her back to his room but fails to get lucky when her pals burst in and take her home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21970785" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-807805518.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970785" width="960" height="535" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Channel 4&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Tourists are drawn by 80P pints, bars that sell Viagra jellies, and all-you-can-drink nights for just 30 euros (£26) — about the same cost as a hotel room[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970841" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-sunny-beach-807805510.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970841" width="960" height="532" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Channel 4&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The Balkan town of Bankso, in the southwest, is already overrun with raucous Brits after earning a repu-tation for cheap booze, parties and affordable ski trips[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;He admits: “I’m a bit optimistic on the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/18478684/vegetable-themed-condoms-slash-sti-rates/"&gt;condoms&lt;/a&gt; but you never know . . . I want to shag a milf and shag a load of foreign birds because I love foreign birds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m 21, a young buck, I’ve got a lot of goals. I’m going to make Sunny Beach my oyster.” Identical twins Oscar and Harvey, 20, from Southampton, are caught on camera peeing on the balcony of their hotel room, flashing their bums in a nightclub, inhaling laughing gas and electrocuting each other with what looks like a stun gun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oscar says: “I expect Mum to call me every hour just to make sure I’m still alive — 500 messages a day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jess and Carmel, care workers from Essex, enjoy a party on a booze-cruise boat trip from Sunny Beach, and trying to hook up with strangers in the street. Carmel, who accident-ally flashes her boob during a pole dance, says: “What happens in ­Bulgaria stays in Bulgaria.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dillan, 19, from Hampshire, blew a grand in a strip club on his first night and he and pal Ollie say they have “no ambitions other than to come home in one piece”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Ollie, also 19, has lost his tooth after he asked Dillan to throw a shot glass at his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another holidaymaker, Ruby, 18, of Herts, says: “I don’t think you can come to Sunny Beach with a boyfriend. If you do, you’re going home without one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the young who are having a ball, though.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colin, 67, wastes six hours of police time trying to find his room while drunk. He is finally reunited with his wife — who is fast asleep and had no idea he was missing — after police call the travel operator and find he is staying just across the street from their station.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But holiday reps have quite the reputation, too. Ex-trucker Harry, 29, a tour guide for five years, tells the camera: “You need to try the Viagra jellies — I had the mango one. It did f***ing work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow rep Liam, 23, an ex-roofer, from Blackpool, says the resort has “helped me find myself a lot” but admits he spent his first season, in 2019, drunk for 12 weeks straight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tp-graphic-bulgaria-map-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21971810" width="960" height="739" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His pal Jacob, 22, also a rep and from Blackpool, says: “Sunny Beach is like paradise. Girls everywhere, bar crawls, boat parties, it’s sick!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sunny Beach is the best place to go for a party — boat parties, bar crawls, you’ll make memories and mates for life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the main, the locals are happy for Brits to splash the cash at Sunny Beach. Taxi drivers love the trade while restaurants sell a three-course meal with wine for £20. You can sober up on coffee for 60p. But local cop Desislava Goranova warns it is not all fun in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;She tells TV viewers: “Sunny Beach is a resort of two extremes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have beautiful nature and a stunning beach, but also places with criminals, drunk people, people on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During the day the resort is so colourful — people having fun and enjoying the beach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At night the central part of the resort goes through a change, the clubs open, it’s full of people with loose morals, a lot of drugs and booze. In my view the usual British tourist looks like this — fair skin, a bit chubby and wearing as little clothing as possible, always very loud and covered in tattoos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Compared to other nationalities the British tourists are always very loud and jolly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They love having lively conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her colleague Emil Tonchev adds: “The British people cause the most problems because they can’t drink.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bulgarians have brandy, the Brits drink beer. We get sober by drinking beer. People come on holiday and lose their senses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But taxi driver Ilea says the resort would be nothing without the tourists. He tells viewers: “Tourists are crazy at night now compared to years ago, especially the young people. They party hard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I grew up in Sunny Beach, the tourists become friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The British tourists are a must here because, without them, Sunny Beach is not the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had two years of Covid without British tourists and Sunny Beach was boring. British tourists are usually nice and polite, they say thank you. I like that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency On Sunny Beach starts on Wednesday at 9pm on E4, and is available on All4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A grandma has claimed her gastric band operation left her with &amp;#8220;smelly loose skin&amp;#8221; and breasts that &amp;#8220;look like udders&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mum-of-two Claudette Hawkins, 59, from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, was once size 36 and weighed 22 stone 8 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971407" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/leaving-unable-sex-hubby-roll-808160456-7.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971407" width="960" height="955" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Claudette Hawkins, 59, from New York, was once size 36[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21972874" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/afc041e6-eb1f-476a-ab8e-a38cfe38bbc2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21972874" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Claudette lost the weight, but says she&amp;#8217;s lost her sex life too&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971406" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/leaving-unable-sex-hubby-roll-808159685.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971406" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Claudette got her gastric sleeve in 2019 and her weight quickly dropped to 11st 9lbs[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971405" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/leaving-unable-sex-hubby-roll-808158664.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971405" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She has to wear compression garments everyday to stop her skin pulling painfully[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Claudette opted for a gastric band four years ago and has now shrunk to a petite size ten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But her skin has been left so saggy she refuses to have sex with her husband or even look in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her skin pulls painfully and &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s a funky smell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s horrendous. The tops of my legs are like elephant stumps, they&amp;#8217;re very heavy with the skin hanging there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claudette first piled on the pounds aged 19 after having her first child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/21546521/love-island-star-so-sick-cancer-battle/"&gt;thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 and put on more weight when she had to have the gland removed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thyroid is responsible for managing the body&amp;#8217;s metabolism, which has a huge impact on weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After entering remission in 2016 she decided she needed to make a major change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She could &amp;#8220;barely walk up the stairs to her apartment&amp;#8221; and wanted to be able to play with her granddaughter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claudette got her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/21599271/gastric-sleeve-turkey-feeding-tube/"&gt;gastric sleeve&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and her weight quickly dropped to 11st 9lbs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gastric sleeve is when a large part of the stomach is removed so it&amp;#8217;s much smaller than it was before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the surgery Claudette was told she might face sagging skin because of the speed of her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was told exercise would help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet Claudette was so unfit she found any movement incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And she has been left with painfully heavy skin as a result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s now hoping to raise enough money for loose skin removal surgery so she can move on with her life.&lt;/p&gt;

					WEIGHT loss surgery is used to treat people who are dangerously obese.				&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most types involve cutting off a section of the stomach so it can&amp;#8217;t digest as much food at one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coupled with exercise and a healthy diet, weight loss surgery has been found to be effective in dramatically reducing a patient&amp;#8217;s excess body fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research in the United States found that people with gastric bands lose around half of their excess body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile gastric bypasses reduce this excess body weight by two thirds post-op.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;#8217;s not always successful &amp;#8211; and patients still need to take responsibility for eating well and&amp;nbsp;working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between a gastric band, bypass and sleeve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three most widely used types of weight loss surgery are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2236124/obese-21-stone-bride-who-was-horrified-by-her-wedding-pictures-dropped-seven-dress-sizes-after-hubby-gave-up-his-dream-car-to-buy-her-a-gastric-band/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gastric band&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Where a band is used to reduce the stomach&amp;#8217;s size, meaning you will feel full after eating a reduced amount of food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2443917/gary-barlow-superfan-loses-11st-after-enormous-selfie-drove-her-to-get-a-gastric-bypass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gastric bypass&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Where your digestive system is re-routed past stomach, so you digest less food and it takes less to make you feel full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2229643/obese-19st-mum-treats-herself-to-a-16000-new-body-for-her-30th-with-a-gastric-sleeve-and-op-to-remove-excess-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleeve gastrectomy&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Where some of the stomach is removed, to reduce the amount of food required to make you feel full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A PINT-sized bodybuilder has been dubbed a &amp;#8220;mini hulk&amp;#8221; for his intense training regime that would break most adult athletes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cauzinho Neto, 12, starts his full-on routine at 5.30am sharp with a three-mile run and sit-ups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970341" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/d6230585-2b3c-4cac-8089-60a0001ca99c.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=614" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970341" width="614" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cauzinho Neto can deadlift 92kg &amp;#8211; despite only weighing 37kg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;@cacauzinho_neto/CEN&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970302" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-cauzinho-neto-undated-808219345.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=544" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970302" width="544" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;@cacauzinho_neto/CEN&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The 12-year-old completes two workouts a day[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The youngster, from Salvador, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, then tucks into breakfast before heading to school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After getting home and finishing his homework, he then launches into his second workout of the day &amp;#8211; completing a two-and-a-half-hour CrossFit weight training session before going to bed at 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cauzinho &amp;#8211; who can deadlift almost three times his own weight – got into bodybuilding when his dad Carlos Pitanga Filho took him to his gym in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now he has a whopping 265,000 followers on Instagram and is tipped to be on his way to becoming a top-rated weightlifter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage of his training shows Cauzinho doing deadlifts, squats, bench presses and then bicep curls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cauzinho&amp;#8217;s proud dad said that his son decided to join a class of older teenagers at the Crossfit Oxente gym after giving up his beloved football.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carlos said: &amp;#8220;He used to be crazy about football before, but then he just wanted to know about CrossFit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We agreed that he would train during the end of the year holidays until the beginning of the next school year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But with 15 days of training, with classes adapted to his age and physical conditioning, Cauzinho was already able to easily execute movements that students who had been training for months couldn&amp;#8217;t even do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cauzinho quickly learnt a number of techniques and built up his muscles, even participating in an amateur LPO Olympic weightlifting championship in Salvador, coming in third.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young boy now only plays football for fun and has his own team made up of a coach, doctor, physiotherapist and nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carlos said: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing sports since I was 10 and it hasn&amp;#8217;t hindered my growth, so much so that today I&amp;#8217;m 1.91 metres tall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But of course, we have this concern and Cauzinho has the follow-up of specialists to anticipate any problems and calibrate his training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In the year and four months, since he started training, he has grown about 13 centimetres, which is expected for his age group.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his parents insist he spends weekends away from training hanging out with his friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His proud dad said that Cauzinho currently weighs 37kg and can deadlift 92kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970322" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 634px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/69e22c42-b985-49b4-937f-76558864b17b.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=624" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970322" width="624" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cauzinho got into weightlifting when his dad took him to his gym two years ago&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;@cacauzinho_neto/CEN&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A MUM has hit back at social media trolls who say her swimwear is &amp;#8220;inappropriate&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amber, who shares clips of her outfits on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, defies what other people think about her often skimpy bikinis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970023" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 574px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/51c5ae06-0f4b-4e8b-a75b-6ad13770c21d.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=564" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970023" width="564" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mum Amber has refused to listen to other people&amp;#8217;s opinions on her bikinis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok - @sinninginsilicone&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21970070" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 586px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/de0a9262-874a-4244-8025-36f28d0870a4.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=576" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21970070" width="576" height="874" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;She often shares clips of her outfits on TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok - @sinninginsilicone&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one clip, she can be seen holding up a towel before dropping it to reveal a black and white bikini with a gold chain and ribbon details around the waist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The caption reads: &amp;#8220;Is this swimsuit &amp;#8216;mum&amp;#8217; appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know y&amp;#8217;all got your opinions on mum bods and bathing suits.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another video, she holds up a light pink blanket before showing off the a blue and white two-piece swimsuit underneath.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She asks in the caption: &amp;#8220;Y&amp;#8217;all wouldn&amp;#8217;t stick around for an average 30+ mum bod huh?&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite getting some backlash over her bikini choices, many of Amber&amp;#8217;s followers rushed to support her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One TikTok user wrote: &amp;#8220;All I can say is wow.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another said: &amp;#8220;Considering how beautiful you are it is very appropriate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a third commented: &amp;#8220;Absolutely. Be proud of yourself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes after a mum-of-three slammed trolls who told her it is &amp;#8220;inappropriate&amp;#8221; to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21312199/mum-of-three-over-40-inappropriate-wear-bikini/"&gt;show off her body in a bikini.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Summer, who is in her 40s, took to&amp;nbsp;TikTok&amp;nbsp;and posted several videos where she can be seen addressing some of the unnecessary remarks she&amp;#8217;s received.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one clip, she replies to a mean comment which reads: &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re a mum… you shouldn&amp;#8217;t post bikini pics.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responding in the best way possible, Summer then shares a selfie where she can be seen posing in a red bikini in front of the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She captioned the post: &amp;#8220;After three kids, I shall wear whatever the f*** I want.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Elle explained that she thinks the woman only said something because her&amp;nbsp;husband&amp;nbsp;couldn&amp;#8217;t stop staring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;STORMY Daniels has revealed in an explosive interview that she was sad to see Donald Trump in court after the former president&amp;#8217;s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The porn star talked with Piers Morgan for 90 minutes on Thursday after Trump&amp;#8217;s historic arraignment this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piers asked Stormy what she felt when she saw Trump charged with 34 felony counts in court. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Part of me was like, he had to go in and be under the rules of someone else, he has to obey the judge … the king has been dethroned,&amp;#8221; Stormy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Honestly, there’s a range of emotions but I think sad was the one that was the most impactful and shocking for me to feel.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The charges against Trump stem from alleged &amp;#8220;hush payments&amp;#8221; made to Stormy and Playboy model Karen McDougal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy told Piers that she doesn&amp;#8217;t believe Trump should be thrown in jail, saying: &amp;#8220;Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;STORMY Daniels is finally set to sit down with Piers Morgan for an explosive interview this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The porn star is speaking out publicly for the first time since former US president Donald Trump was arrested earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview will air on TalkTV at 3pm ET and on Fox Nation at 4pm ET. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piers has described the interview with Daniels as “one of the best interviews [he’s] ever done.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highly anticipated interview was originally supposed to take place last week. However, the porn star postponed it due to &amp;#8220;security reasons.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A RUNNER is feared to have been mauled to death by a bear in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea Papi, 26, was jogging through woodland when he failed to return home for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21969503" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 967px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/andrea-papi-26-poses-undated-808218303.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=957" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21969503" width="957" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Andrea Papi, 26, was out running when he failed to return home[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21969510" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/andrea-papi-26-poses-undated-808218125.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21969510" width="960" height="801" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;His badly mauled body was found by rescue teams[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Rescue teams found his badly savaged body on Thursday in Val di Sole, Trentino, North &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, hours after he was reported missing by his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea&amp;#8217;s body was covered in severe wounds that looked like the result of a wild animal attack, local media reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PT student is believed to have been attacked by one or more bears on the forest road overlooking the town.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An autopsy is being carried out to determine if Andrea was already dead when the animals found him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprits are likely to be brown bears which live in forests and woodlands in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea&amp;#8217;s devastated girlfriend Alessia Gregori shared a tribute to him, describing him as &amp;#8220;my life&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local MP Maurizio Fugatti said: &amp;#8220;This is a moment of pain, so I believe that what is right must be done in respect of the people concerned at this particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was on site this morning and I was able, together with the local authorities, to see what had happened in person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We then met the administrators of the municipality concerned and of the entire valley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The prefect was alerted and together it was decided to set up a committee for public order and safety.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Locals claim bear sightings have increased recently and just last month several farms were targeted by grizzly beasts and one sheep was mauled to death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A PLASTIC surgeon has been accused of leaving a beauty queen&amp;#8217;s face horrifically mutilated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blonde beauty Yulia Tarasevich, 44, came close to victory in the Mrs Russia-International contest 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21969177" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 712px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msemail_CEN-SurgeonMutilated-12jpg-JS808215127.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=702" alt="Photo shows Yulia Tarasevich, undated. Yulia Tarasevich, who was runner-up in the Mrs Russia-International contest 2020, has been left 'disfigured' after several botched surgeries. (Yulia Tarasevich/CEN)" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21969177" width="702" height="703" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The gorgeous beauty queen has filed charges against the surgeons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;cen&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21969190" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 551px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msemail_CEN-SurgeonMutilated-05jpg-JS808215115.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=541" alt="Photo shows Yulia Tarasevich, undated. Yulia Tarasevich, who was runner-up in the Mrs Russia-International contest 2020, has been left 'disfigured' after several botched surgeries. (CEN)" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21969190" width="541" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;She&amp;#8217;s been left &amp;#8216;disfigured&amp;#8217; after the procedure&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;cen&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yulia planned to get a facelift, a cosmetic correction of the eyelids and a mini-liposuction at a private clinic in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it went &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17732904/beauty-queen-disfigured-after-botched-3000-facelift/"&gt;horribly wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said 45-year-old surgeon Andrei Komarov persuaded her to have the operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the botched procedure left her with a &amp;#8220;mutilated&amp;#8221; face, she claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was unable to close her eyes or even move her face, allegedly as a result of the operation at the practice in the city of Krasnodar in southern Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another doctor had to be drafted in to perform emergency follow-up surgery to save her eyes from necrosis, she said in a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mother-of-two Yulia said she paid £3,000 for the operations, after which her face became badly swollen and inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She ended up spending a further £20,000 to try and correct the problems but without any success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has since decided to file a criminal complaint over the botched treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Prosecutor’s Office of the Krasnodar Territory, which investigated her complaint, charged one surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Komarov will be prosecuted over providing services that &amp;#8220;did not meet the requirements of consumer health safety&amp;#8221; because they negligently caused serious bodily harm, local media reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If convicted, the doctor &amp;#8211; who denies the charges &amp;#8211; faces up to six years in jail and a fine of up to £4,970.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the case ends, he is also facing a civil case for damages from the former beauty queen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The civil damages case has already been filed alongside the criminal case being heard at the Leninsky District Court of Krasnodar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yulia claims she suffers from depression as a result of the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she was also left unable to close her eyelids or smile and her face is asymmetrical. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surgeons claim Yulia had a rare genetic condition &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;scleroderma &amp;#8211; which made it impossible to predict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They deny responsibility for her nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She told local media: &amp;#8220;When I came to them, I had a beautiful, healthy face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I just wanted to correct some small things and slow down the ageing process. In the end, though, I lost my beauty and my health.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21969218" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msemail_CEN-SurgeonMutilated-18jpg-JS808215180.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=600" alt="Photo shows Omar Khaled, undated.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PARANOID Vladimir Putin has reportedly set up a massive missile batteries to guard his mystery mountain residence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian opposition leader &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/alexei-navalny/"&gt;Alexei Navalny&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; team&amp;nbsp;said the Pantsir anti-aircraft launcher has been installed less than a mile from Putin&amp;#8217;s sprawling secret bolthole just outside the resort city of Sochi. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962016" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mystery-putins-secret-mountain-palace-808176811.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962016" width="960" height="645" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;YouTube/Navalny Live&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The mystery residence is owned by Gazprom &amp;#8211; but it&amp;#8217;s said to be Putin&amp;#8217;s winter home[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21961958" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 579px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000808176817.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=569" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21961958" width="569" height="663" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;YouTube/Nalvany Live&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Navalny&amp;#8217;s team shared a photo of the anti-aircraft missile system in the mountains[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21961957" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000808176813.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21961957" width="960" height="573" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;YouTube/Nalvany Live&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s sprawling secret bolthole just outside the resort city of Sochi[/caption]

&lt;figure id="attachment_21966055" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-event-804373130.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21966055" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Putin allegedly winters at the palace with his lover, Alina Kabaeva[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Navalny&amp;#8217;s associates shared a photo of the self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon plonked in the middle of the mountains in Krasnaya Polyana overlooking the snow-capped peaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin’s top-secret luxury ski lodge &amp;#8211; where he is believed to winter with his gymnast mistress &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/"&gt;Alina Kabaeva&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; is said to be located less than one mile away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to information released by Navalny&amp;#8217;s team and translated by The Sun Online, the property contains extraordinary luxuries such as crystal lamps, caviar plates and £1,000 blankets. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 41,000-square-foot mansion boasts its own cryo chamber, a helipad, several Finnish saunas, a private ski lift, a pantry dedicated to pickles, and a steam room, according to &lt;a aria-label="Navalny Live (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5YY8DgU7RM&amp;amp;t=201s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Navalny Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mystery property is owned by state-owned energy giant Gazprom &amp;#8211; but it&amp;#8217;s said to be Putin&amp;#8217;s secret residence where he goes skiing with former Olympian&amp;nbsp;Alina, 39.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia’s hardman leader&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5872683/vladimir-putin-guards-secret-billions-rich-net-worth/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;is reported to be worth £160bn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and is said to live like a king on his extraordinary wealth, with some suggesting he is one of the world&amp;#8217;s richest men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His critics claim he has amassed a huge personal fortune and owns a fleet of yachts, cars and secret presidential palaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navalny Live believe the sprawling estate in Sochi belongs to Putin as it has the same rooms and a similar set-up to the Russian tyrant&amp;#8217;s other boltholes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like this other &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19909948/putin-vanishes-luxury-forest-palace-protests-sweep-russia/"&gt;secret palaces&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s thought paranoid Putin could be using the remote properties to hunker down with his mistress as his shambolic invasion of Ukraine rages in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the report, chalet &amp;#8220;Achipse&amp;#8221; was built for him during the Winter Olympic Games in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidden from prying eyes by the mountains, the mansion itself sits on a plot of 49 acres of land, with two homes and guesthouses for staff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main property has four floors, including two underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Navalny Live, one of the houses on the estate contains Swarovski crystal-clad lamps worth £5,000, a £60,000 piano, a £1,000 goose down blanket, and a shoe cleaning machine worth £7,200. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of Putin&amp;#8217;s purchases also included a £6,550 heated banquet cart, a £5,000 clock, a £500 caviar plate, a £560 electric boiler, a £750 leather bin and a £539 napkin holder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navalny’s team obtained what they claimed to be the blueprints for Putin’s property, revealing a four-storey building, with two of the floors located underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The floorplans show various food preparation stations, including egg and vegetable processing rooms, walk-in refrigerators for meat and fish, and a pantry for pickles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basement is home to a spa, complete with a pool, salt and steam rooms, and Finnish-style and herbal saunas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s even a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/NYPICHPDPICT000009176184.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;hydromassage bath, and a selection of hot and cold plunge pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to reports, the residence has a radar system that can track drones, bugs hidden in the walls, and pipe bombs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navalny&amp;#8217;s team said the Pantsir missile system &amp;#8211; designed by Russia &amp;#8211; matches the one at Putin&amp;#8217;s other residences and boltholes around Moscow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January, Pantsir missile systems were also spotted near two of Putin&amp;#8217;s residences in the city of&amp;nbsp;Valday&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Novo-Ogaryovo&amp;nbsp;estate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Air defence systems have also been put on the rooftops of several buildings in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guy McCardle, managing editor of&amp;nbsp;Special Operations Forces Report, told&amp;nbsp;&lt;a aria-label="Newsweek (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newsweek.com/air-defenses-being-installed-near-putins-sochi-home-oppositionists-claim-1792308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s no way he does not have both defensive and offensive capabilities near his many residences or anywhere he will be spending a substantial period of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are there to protect him and his family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As a part of a coordinated air defence system, I think these would be extremely effective at knocking drones, missiles, helicopters and even fighter jets out of the sky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Russian media outlet Meduza, Putin officially has three residences &amp;#8211; not including the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple properties have been linked to the Russian leader in recent years &amp;#8211; and the palaces are often located in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to reports, Putin is said to be living with his gymnast girlfriend and their kids in a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13792316/putins-secret-1billion-palace/"&gt;luxurious mansion near Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 13,000 square feet property on Lake Valdai, built entirely from wood in the style of a Russian dacha, is reportedly home Kabaeva.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Russian leader is believed to have bought her a&amp;nbsp;property&amp;nbsp;empire valued at £100million using a slush fund in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/cyprus/"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, Russian investigative site The Project claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures of the mansion, leaked by a construction executive, reveal its luxurious interiors, which are said to have been inspired by Putin’s love for his hometown of St Petersburg and its eighteenth-century Hermitage Museum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports about the existence of the villa first emerged in 2021 by the team of&amp;nbsp;Navalny, who said that budget funds were used to lease the property from Kovalchuk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navalny&amp;#8217;s team also previously alleged Putin owns a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13869364/putins-1bn-palace-removed-from-maps-spying-fears/"&gt;£1billion Black Sea&amp;nbsp;palace&amp;nbsp;at Gelendzhik&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; which included a red velvet pole-dancing boudoir and a casino.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another close Putin friend, billionaire Arkady Rotenberg, 69, later claimed the property was his.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FORMER porn star Lana Rhoades flashed her followers in a cheeky pic &amp;#8211; but she was mercilessly mocked for a &amp;#8220;hideous&amp;#8221; detail in the snap. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13698261/lana-rhoades-pornhub-star-prudish-outside-adult-industray/"&gt;The 26-year-old stunner&lt;/a&gt; was pictured strolling around the streets of Brooklyn, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, after grabbing a snack on a sunny day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21967432" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-porn-star-lana-rhoades-808192445.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21967432" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Lana Rhoades showed off her long legs in tiny shorts and a t-shirt in the snaps[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21967440" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-porn-star-lana-rhoades-808192441.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21967440" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Social media users were unimpressed with one detail in the images[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She braved the brisk winds in a tiny pair of grey shorts and a t-shirt, while bystanders in the back of the images were seen bundled up in coats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; photo, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/17314936/who-lana-rhoades/"&gt;Lana&lt;/a&gt; flaunts her long legs as she approached a crossing while clutching a bagel and a brown paper bag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the second, the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/17315005/lana-rhoades-baby-pregnant-kid-child/"&gt;mum-of-one&lt;/a&gt; sits down to tuck into her food on a staircase, seemingly unphased by the freezing February temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She finished the carousel with a close-up shot of her bagel, brimming with salmon and cream cheese. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s not the ex-adult actress&amp;#8217;s choice of grub that has got people talking &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s her footwear. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/11043812/pornhub-lana-rhoades-video-footballer-instagram-dm/"&gt;Lana&lt;/a&gt; aptly captioned the post: &amp;#8220;Boots &amp;amp; Bagels.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;Social media&lt;/a&gt; users weren&amp;#8217;t impressed by her £3,650 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/21782437/hasbulla-super-mario-red-boots/"&gt;Big Red Boots&lt;/a&gt; by the brand MSCHF, which have become a staple among celebs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cartoonish shoes have been a controversial talking point online for months, as not everyone is a fan of the unique design. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A host of Lana&amp;#8217;s followers flooded the comment section with taunts about the boots, which have been worn by the likes of rappers &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/14526617/coi-leray-instagram-twerk-trolls-body-shaming/"&gt;Coi Leray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/17119955/how-many-hits-does-lil-wayne-have/"&gt;Lil Wayne.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One said: &amp;#8220;People really just be wearing anything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another wrote: &amp;#8220;Wtf is the hype about? Cause in my opinion these Astro Boy boots are hideous.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third simply sneered: &amp;#8220;Clown boots.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a fourth chimed in: &amp;#8220;Bruh how do you all even rock those boots?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/chicago/"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;-born Lana ditched the porn industry to produce her own material on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/onlyfans/"&gt;OnlyFans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She boasts over 992,000 subscribers on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youtube/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; as well as amassing over 16million followers on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vlogger gave birth to her first child, a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/17329815/lana-rhoades-baby-daddy/"&gt;baby boy named Milo&lt;/a&gt;, in January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was accused of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17780282/porn-star-lana-rhoades-takes-crypto-failed-nft-project/"&gt;fleecing investors out of £1.5million in an NFT scam&lt;/a&gt; just a month later. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lana began flogging cartoon caricatures of herself as part of a project dubbed &amp;#8216;Cryptosis&amp;#8217;, promising people its value would increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she allegedly disappeared after failing to fulfill her promises, taking £1.5m in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cryptocurrency/"&gt;crypto&lt;/a&gt;-cash with her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21967458" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 779px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/porn-mild-porn-star-lana-629654140.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=769" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21967458" width="769" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The mum-of-one was mocked for wearing the Big Red Boots[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21967448" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kardashian-fans-reveal-theory-tristan-758354490.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21967448" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram / Lana Rhoades&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;People branded her footwear &amp;#8216;hideous&amp;#8217;[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A MAN got the ultimate payback on his neighbour who he claims always calls the cops on him for being too &amp;#8220;noisy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikToker &lt;/a&gt;took to social media to reveal how he got his &amp;#8220;sweet revenge&amp;#8221; on his next-door neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21966328" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 317px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7ecb8685-3abf-4a31-949a-de7d12e777b1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=307" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21966328" width="307" height="342" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The TikToker got &amp;#8216;sweet revenge&amp;#8217; on his neighbour who he claims calls the cops on him for being &amp;#8216;too noisy&amp;#8217;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;tiktok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21966329" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 314px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a25a648a-4847-4238-bf7f-3092a34bdc9b.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=304" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21966329" width="304" height="378" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;He held his speaker out of the window while blaring What&amp;#8217;s Poppin by Jack Harlow&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;tiktok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21966331" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 318px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3dc041e2-f211-4c6b-916f-0d8089f25b57.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=308" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21966331" width="308" height="345" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The woman can be seen standing up and heading indoors while the music plays&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;tiktok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man posted the 15-second clip of his payback which has racked up a mega 393.5k likes and over 1600 comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video shows his neighbour relaxing on a patio in her back garden as she sits in the sunshine on a deckchair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man then zooms into woman while showing his viewers a red speaker that he&amp;#8217;s holding out of an open window.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The caption reads: &amp;#8220;So we have this neighbor who calls the cops on us for being noisy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So I decided to ruin her nice day out by being to noisy &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; payback is a b*tch,&amp;#8221; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TikToker then begins blaring out the popular rap song, What&amp;#8217;s Poppin by &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jack-harlow/"&gt;Jack Harlow&lt;/a&gt; until she begins to pack up her things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The neighbour can be seen holding her phone and book before standing up and storming back into her house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man captioned the TikTok: &amp;#8220;Revenge is sweet,&amp;#8221; but he was quickly slammed by his followers who had other opinions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One person wrote: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not cool to play loud music man. Your neighbours have lives and loud music becomes a bad distraction. Please be considerate&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another said: &amp;#8220;Come on people just want to enjoy there life don&amp;#8217;t bother your neighbour&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third commented: &amp;#8220;Or you could just be respectful because people don&amp;#8217;t want to hear your loud music all day long. You&amp;#8217;re the problem bro&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A fourth fired back: &amp;#8220;Sorry but I&amp;#8217;m on her side. I also like silence and being a home owner I expect that I can enjoy my silence both inside and outside my home&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TikToker is known by his 412.7k followers for posting comedy skits, relationship advice and about mental health awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21894362/neighbours-hate-purple-house-took-petty-revenge/"&gt;a woman took petty revenge on her neighbours after hearing them &amp;#8220;talk s**t&amp;#8221; about the colour of her house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She painted her home a &amp;#8220;gorgeous New Orleans purple&amp;#8221; to match her hair dye and loves the fact that it annoys her neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/21874414/revenge-on-neighbour-left-aggressive-notes-car/"&gt;driver revealed how she took revenge on her neighbour&lt;/a&gt; who kept leaving aggressive notes on her car.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GRUESOME pictures show Catholics in the Philippines whipping and slashing themselves as they march through streets for an Easter ritual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/philippines/"&gt;Filipinos&lt;/a&gt; perform the religious penance in the week leading to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/easter/"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; in the hope they will be cleansed of sins and illnesses and their wishes might be granted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964366" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808167225.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964366" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Filipinos whipping themselves as part of an Easter ritual[/caption]

&lt;figure id="attachment_21965059" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808174322.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965059" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Some had bamboo sticks tied to their arms[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21965598" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dominant-roman-catholic-church-philippines-808113679.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965598" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;One of the penitents having their back slashed[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;There are 90 million&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/catholicism/"&gt; Catholics &lt;/a&gt;in the Philippines, the most for an Asian country, and third in the world, only behind Brazil and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many attended church on Palm Sunday marked the beginning of Holy Week with prayers for the health of Pope Francis, while others performed flagellation rituals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures show the hooded penitents marching through the streets of Mandaluyong city as they beat themselves with bamboo tipped whips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such is the force of the blows that blood can be seen flowing from their wounds as they lie face down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other penitents had their backs slashed with sharp objects as they also lie with their faces pressed to the road.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The barefoot devotees also kneel down on the road during the bizarre rituals as by-standers look on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others had stakes tied tied to their arms with the points digging into their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other rituals include Filipino Catholics &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5943288/good-friday-easter-2018-crucifixion-philippines/"&gt;nailing themselves to crosses &lt;/a&gt;in a gruesome Good Friday re-enactment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They include Ruben Enaje, 63, who will be nailed on Good Friday for the 34th time to a wooden cross, with which he emulates the passion of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enaje will drag a heavy 80lb cross for 1.2 miles through the streets of San Pedro de Cutud, before the palms of his hands are pierced to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I will offer this to people who have been affected by Covid-19, and I pray to our Lord that this disease will suddenly disappear because many people have suffered from the pandemic,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church, the faith of 80 per cent of Filipinos, has expressed disapproval of self-flagellation and considers it an extreme misinterpretation of faith.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Archbishop Socrates Villegas has implored Catholics to mark Lent with prayers and acts of love and charity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Instead of spilling your blood on the streets, why not walk into a Red Cross office and donate blood? Choose to share life. Share your blood,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21965092" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808174555-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965092" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Penitents praying on their knees during the ritual[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21965018" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-mandaluyong-city-philippines-covid-808174557.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21965018" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Those taking part in the ritual lying on the ground[/caption]

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A COUPLE covered with the world&amp;#8217;s most tattoos and body modifications have been mistaken as &amp;#8220;demons&amp;#8221; when in public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-america/"&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; pair&amp;#8217;s transformation has become a local sensation with the married lovers set to renew a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/guinness-world-records/"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt; title they&amp;#8217;ve held for almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964143" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 601px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/84-now-ve-renewed-title-808136745.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=591" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964143" width="591" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press/@victor_h_peralta&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Before pictures of Gabriela Peralta, who is now covered in ink[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964141" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 626px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/84-now-ve-renewed-title-808136640.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=616" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964141" width="616" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press/@victor_h_peralta&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A picture of her husband, Victor, who has also undergone a huge transformation[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21963982" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 968px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/84-now-ve-renewed-title-808136843.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=958" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21963982" width="958" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press/@victor_h_peralta&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Victor&amp;#8217;s devil &amp;#8220;666&amp;#8221; tattoo on his head[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Victor and Gabriel Peralta from Buenos Aires, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1322323/argentina/"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, currently hold the official Guinness World Record for &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17818874/worlds-most-extreme-body-modification-fans/"&gt;most body modifications&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (married couple).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They earnt the title in 2014, with 84 modifications between them at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures showed the couple with their freakish implants and satanic tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victor even has the devil&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;666&amp;#8221; carved into his scalp, alongside £400 metal horns implanted into his skull.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man recalled getting his first inking at 13 with the word f**k across the fingers on his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, he became obsessed – with more that 95 per cent of his body inked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victor aspired to emulate a demon, which caught the eye of his now wife, Gabriela, who have been happily married for the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple now have a combined 91 tattoos and modifications between them as the look to renew their record for its ten year anniversary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gabriela told NeedToKnow: &amp;#8220;When we received the title, I felt immense emotion and pride at being awarded for my choice of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve always been faithful to what I like and the image I want to have, respecting my inner being, which has been closely linked to art.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Growing up in my grandparent’s house, I breathed art 24-hours a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My grandfather was a musician and a photographer, with my grandmother a painter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I grew up with art all around me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victor, 52, has always had skin in the game &amp;#8211; owning his own tattoo parlour for more than 28 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;My father loved drawing and thanks to him, I adopted that passion for drawing and later grew up tattooing people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then, the modifications arrived and one day Guinness found us and awarded us for this passion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I’m so happy and proud to be awarded with my wife for our life itself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple estimated they have spent thousands of pounds on their modifications, which included pointed ears and forked tongues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the duo said most of their body work had been gifts from friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But their journey has not been a smooth ride &amp;#8211; the couple fell victim to online trolls who branded them &amp;#8220;Cherubs from&amp;nbsp;hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victor said: &amp;#8220;People react in different ways&amp;#8230; surprise, curiosity and fear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re often congratulated for our courage and for being daring, both with the pain threshold and tolerance for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But also because we’re confronting society by choosing a lifestyle that&amp;#8217;s so different to other people without having any type of concerns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We live it naturally and without prejudice – we simply are and we live as we want.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;TEN crew members onboard a Japanese military helicopter are feared dead after the chopper vanished from flight radar over the East China Sea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/japan/"&gt;Japan&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; coast guard said the Black Hawk chopper disappeared while on a surveillance mission on Thursday evening as the country&amp;#8217;s Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada revealed debris from the plane had been discovered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973921" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-search-rescue-operation-continued-808310695.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973921" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Debris from the missing helicopter was discovered by patrol boats after it vanished on Thursday[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21973922" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-search-rescue-operation-continued-808310706.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21973922" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;None of the missing crew members have been found[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The disappearance comes as the country beefs up its defence in response to China&amp;#8217;s growing military activity in the region over Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Minister Yasukazu Hamada, apparently struggling to hold back tears, told reporters that none of the ten missing crew members have been found as the search continued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he took the accident seriously and would take all precautions for the safe operations of Self-Defense Force aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;We will do our utmost for the rescue of the 10 people who are still missing while continuing to gather information related to the extent of the damage.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UH-60JA Black Hawk helicopter disappeared Thursday afternoon while on a reconnaissance mission in Japan&amp;#8217;s southern islands, according to the head of the Ground Self-Defense Force, Yasunori Morishita.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It disappeared from radar only 10 minutes after departing from a base on Miyako Island and is believed to have crashed into the water between Miyako and nearby Irabu Island to the northwest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The area is about 1,120 miles southwest of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coast guard patrol ships found an unused lifeboat whose serial number matched that of the missing helicopter and a door believed to belong to the same aircraft near the presumed crash site, army officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kyodo News said Japanese coast guard ships also found traces of oil and what appeared to be the helicopter&amp;#8217;s rotor in the sea, according to local reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The army said the helicopter had a routine safety inspection in late March. No abnormality was found during its subsequent test flight or on its trip from its home base of Kumamoto to Miyako island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japan started deploying the Black Hawk, a twin-engine, four-bladed utility helicopter developed by U.S. manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft and produced by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, in 1999 for rapid response, surveillance, and disaster relief missions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;CHOPPER HORROR &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chopper, belonging to Japan&amp;#8217;s Ground Self-Defense Force, had two pilots, two mechanics, and six crew members on board when it disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to local media reports, senior Japanese army commander Yuichi Sakamoto was on the helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: &amp;#8220;We will do our utmost to save their lives.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chief of staff of the Japanese army said: &amp;#8220;The radar track disappeared in the ocean north-northwest of Miyako Island. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Based on the discovered debris, it is presumed to be an aircraft accident.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Japanese army said the aircraft belongs to a base in on Japan&amp;#8217;s southern main island of Kyushu and was visiting Miyako Island on a surveillance mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located about 400km east of Taiwan, Miyako Island is home to the Japanese army&amp;#8217;s missile unit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2016, six people were killed after an Air Self-Defense Force U-125 inspection plane crashed in the mountains in Kagoshima.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A WOMAN was left stunned when she hit the lotto jackpot after dreaming of numbers &amp;#8211; and even claims she saw them in real life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/malaysia/"&gt;Malaysian &lt;/a&gt;shop owner allegedly had repeated dreams of the winning digits before bagging over £2,900,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964690" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/person-plays-mega-millions-lottery-808041779.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964690" width="960" height="634" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The lucky woman claims to have dreamt of recurring numbers and also says she saw them in real life[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She revealed how she kept seeing two numbers, 3887 and 5785, not only in her sleep but also in real life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lucky winner scooped the huge sum in the Magnum 4D &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/national-lottery/"&gt;Jackpot &lt;/a&gt;draw on March 29.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She told local media: &amp;#8220;The number 5785 kept showing up in my dreams, and I just had to try my luck to purchase this number.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman also explained her shock after she took a trip to see her relatives and saw several cars with 3887 in the number plate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She then spotted a Magnum 4D outlet while out buying fruit and said she followed her instincts to purchase a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After seeing both sets of numbers drawn, she admitted to being so stunned that she had to double-check with her son to make sure she wasn&amp;#8217;t dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When talking on the plans she has for her newly made fortune, the woman said: “Being a business shop owner, it’s a seven-day job for me. I have not taken a vacation in years. I would love to spend time with my family, and now, I finally can.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is also taking the time out of her busy store job to focus on her future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as a holiday, the winner said she can now finally buy her dream family home after renting for years and donate a chunk to charity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21770278/won-lottery-twice-one-go-beat-incredible-odds/"&gt;one lottery player managed to beat the odds of one in 292million to win twice&lt;/a&gt; in the same draw.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lucky man bought ten tickets from his local grocery store and managed to scoop a whopping total of £240,500.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21701585/won-lottery-bought-ticket-very-spooky-feeling/"&gt; woman who bought a lottery ticket after a spooky inner voice told her to&lt;/a&gt; ended up winning £820,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wendy Hester &amp;#8211; from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-carolina/"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; said she was grocery shopping when she was stopped in her tracks by the voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A SINGLE mum who quit her job as a banker for an OnlyFans career now makes £1,200 a day and has just bought her third property.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucy&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Banks, from Perth, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, took up adult content creation after quitting her business banking job in 2019 &amp;#8211; and now claims her two sons are &amp;#8220;set for life&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962927" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 683px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-instagram-com-itsnotlucybanks-hl-734903551.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=673" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962927" width="673" height="672" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The OnlyFans model makes £1,200 a day on the adult content sharing platform[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21963884" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 875px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-instagram-com-imlucybanks-808180529.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=865" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21963884" width="865" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She quit her job as a business banker and has now bought three properties in a year[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old has just bought her third dream &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/"&gt;home &lt;/a&gt;this year, after making over £215,000 worth of sales in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I bought my absolute dream home for my kids and I. We&amp;#8217;ll never move again, we&amp;#8217;ll stay there forever,&amp;#8221; Lucy said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is massive and has room for all our family and friends there. Even some chickens! I&amp;#8217;m really proud to have done this and shown my kids that mum will always make it work for them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucy said she gained a good amount of equity after she bought and renovated her first property less than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She began strictly saving for deposits with her earnings in September 2022 and has now been able to secure her sons a place on the property market before they&amp;#8217;ve even reached the age of ten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the adult content creator is not stopping there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;I want to buy more properties and eventually have a portfolio. I hope to fund my retirement through these properties.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/onlyfans/"&gt;OnlyFans&lt;/a&gt;, the mum-of-two also has several online businesses she runs from home to create a &amp;#8220;little empire&amp;#8221;, and&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18678918/mum-quits-job-works-onlyfans-when-kids-asleep/"&gt; said that the flexibility of the adult platform allows her to be present for her kids&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My kids go to two different private schools that cater to their individual needs; it takes me three hours every day to do the school run, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;After school I help with homework, cook dinner and put them to bed. My current job allows me the flexibility to do that… my former job did not.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mum has a range of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/side-hustle/"&gt;side hustles&lt;/a&gt; that include selling visual adult content, a drop shipping website and talking to people for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;#8217;t come without its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Being a single mum on OnlyFans and being from a small town; I&amp;#8217;ve copped so much judgement,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My work is not illegal, and it&amp;#8217;s just the same as anybody else&amp;#8217;s internet business.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucy is now hoping that other single mums hear about her journey and become inspired to invest in the property market with these &amp;#8220;work from anywhere&amp;#8221; platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said that &amp;#8220;coming from absolutely nothing&amp;#8221; meant she didn&amp;#8217;t want to be risky with her money &amp;#8211; so opted for property as the safest way to invest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when the OnlyFans model first began discussing building an investment property with her kids, they wanted to know how they could contribute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucy revealed how she was touched at their gestures and said: &amp;#8220;My kids both gave me $100 each to &amp;#8216;invest&amp;#8217; in this new house; once we have tenants in it, they&amp;#8217;ll both receive $5.50 each a week.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mum said her two boys came up with the idea themselves and earned the money from doing chores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It never even crossed my mind to include the kids in buying investment properties but my eldest son is so excited and is constantly talking to me about how to maximise their investment,&amp;#8221; Lucy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They have already worked out that by the time they are adults themselves, they will have enough for their own house deposits &amp;#8211; all from this initial $100 deposit as children.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lucy has explained how she is wary of the potential future challenges her kids may face getting into the property market once they are adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Buying a property is such a huge hurdle. There is no way I could have bought a property as a single mother without OnlyFans,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My boys won&amp;#8217;t be receiving hand-outs or trust funds &amp;#8211; but I will put them through the best schools and I will help them be financially smart. The rest is up to them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964074" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 685px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-instagram-com-itsnotlucybanks-hl-734903844.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=675" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964074" width="675" height="674" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The glam mum opted for property investment as it was the &amp;#8216;safest&amp;#8217;[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962932" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-instagram-com-imlucybanks-808180455.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962932" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The OnlyFans model says she wants to continue building her property portfolio from her earnings[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;STORMY Daniels has vowed she will testify if asked to give evidence against Donald Trump in an astonishing interview with Piers Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 44-year-old sat down with the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/talk-tv/"&gt;TalkTV&lt;/a&gt; host as the former US President was this week &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21905595/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-indictment-response/"&gt;hauled to court&lt;/a&gt; over alleged hush money he paid her in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964225" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 543px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/45bf4438-9364-4e45-a927-7b060554e925.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=533" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964225" width="533" height="487" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stormy Daniels pictured with Piers Morgan&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971256" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stormy-daniels-piers-morgan-talk-808189239.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="Stormy Daniels on Piers Morgan  Talk TV  Programme, Sun Screengrab" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971256" width="960" height="479" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The 44-year-old has insisted she has &amp;#8216;nothing to hide&amp;#8217;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21971042" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 440px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2006-american-century-celebrity-golf-377920615-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=430" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21971042" width="430" height="581" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Refer to caption&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Donald Trump pictured with Stormy Daniels[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21946540/donald-trump-america-hell-arrest-charges/"&gt;Trump is accused of financial crimes&lt;/a&gt; over the $130,000 he allegedly paid Stormy to keep quiet over claims they had an affair in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Republican has decried the case against him as a witch hunt &amp;#8211; claiming it is politically motivated and led by the Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He faces &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21945089/president-donald-trump-court-appearance-criminal-charges/"&gt;34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/a&gt; in the first degree. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy&amp;#8217;s 90-minute chat with Piers is her first TV interview since Trump&amp;#8217;s arrest on Tuesday, broadcast on TalkTV in the UK and released on streaming service Fox Nation in the US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sun columnist Piers described the interview as &amp;#8220;astonishing&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and said he was giving the former porn star a chance to tell her story &amp;#8220;about the fling that may send President Trump to prison&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And during their chat, Stormy vowed she will testify if Trump&amp;#8217;s case goes to trial, saying she has &amp;#8220;nothing to hide&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You weren’t asked to give evidence to the grand jury, but you may be asked to testify if this ends up as a trial. How do you feel about potentially testifying in a trial that will be watched around the world?&amp;#8221; Piers asked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy replied: &amp;#8220;Any time you’re up in the public eye it’s scary. I mean, used to get scared giving an oral book report in school, so it’s daunting, but I look forward to it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She went on: &amp;#8220;I have nothing to hide. I’m the only one that has been telling the truth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And, you know, you can’t shame me even more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So I feel like if they don’t, it paints the picture that they know something about me that makes me you know, untrustworthy, or not reliable.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think having them call me in and put me on the stand legitimises my story and who I am,&amp;#8221; added Stormy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Stormy &amp;#8211; who is a registered Republican but said she did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 &amp;#8211; told Piers that she does not believe he should face jail for his alleged crimes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she explained that for other alleged crimes he is under investigation for &amp;#8211; Trump could end up being sent to prison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is currently also under investigation for mishandling government documents, over allegations of fraud, and for attempting to interfere with the 2020 presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy told Piers: &amp;#8220;I feel like the other things that he has done, if he is found guilty, absolutely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8216;TELL THE TRUTH&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also urged Trump, who she claims got his bodyguard to ask for her phone number, to &amp;#8220;tell the truth&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy added: &amp;#8220;If you continue to do this you are setting a precedent where people think that they won&amp;#8217;t held accountable and I&amp;#8217;m afraid there are gong to be a lot of people hurt.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She warned if Trump escapes jail if found guilty of other crimes it could &amp;#8220;open the door for other people to think they can get away with doing that and worse&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of his bombshell court appearance, Trump raged the US is &amp;#8220;going to hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination and will likely take on his nemesis Joe Biden in 2024&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His indictment is seen by many analysts as handing him the ticket &amp;#8211; cauterising his hardline base who may have been turning towards rival Ron DeSantis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is using his legal trouble as a way to rile up his diehard supporters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it remains to be seen how his arrest will play with key swing voters who were turned off by Trump in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stormy also revealed &amp;#8220;one in ten&amp;#8221; messages she receives are death threats and she wishes she&amp;#8217;d never met Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;They [the messages] would always be from an account somebody created just to do that with no followers, hidden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Now it&amp;#8217;s different, the tone is different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And they are way more specific and graphic. They seem to be more serious in a way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re not hiding &amp;#8211; these people are using their phone numbers, and their actual emails and their actual Twitter accounts &amp;#8211; which then makes it worse because they actually have followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They genuinely feel they are doing something right.&amp;nbsp;It makes you become paranoid.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21964400" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-u-s-president-donald-807822941.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964400" width="960" height="639" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He sits with members of his legal team at the hearing in Manhatten[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21964415" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/former-us-president-donald-trump-807863554-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21964415" width="960" height="612" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trump speaks at an event in Mar-a-Lago[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;After returning home to his Mar-a-Lago resort from New York on Tuesday, Trump gave a venomous speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking out to &amp;#8220;God Bless the USA&amp;#8221;, Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case &amp;#8211; calling him &amp;#8220;the real criminal&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He accused Juan Merchan of being a &amp;#8220;Trump hating judge with a Trump hating wife and family&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and said the case against him was &amp;#8220;an insult to our country&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The only crime I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump called for&amp;nbsp;the &amp;#8220;ridiculous&amp;#8221; case to be &amp;#8220;dropped immediately&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he suggested he lost the 2020 US election unfairly &amp;#8220;because our country is going to hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump denies the claim by Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/"&gt;Melania&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; and four months after she gave birth to their son &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2183312/how-tall-barron-trump-height-age/"&gt;Barron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/"&gt;former lawyer Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argue this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he cannot allow &amp;#8220;businesses to cover up criminal conduct&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The historic case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The indictment focused on Trump&amp;#8217;s reimbursement checks to Cohen &amp;#8211; with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the full interview on the Piers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channel in the UK or on Fox Nation &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A SAVVY homeowner has banked £2,200 in a month, while she was on holiday &lt;strong&gt;with a simple housing hack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman, who owns a two-by-one duplex, claimed there was money to be made regardless if a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/property/"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; was occupied by a family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962534" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/make-2k-a-month-taken-808177998.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962534" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok/ scrunchyfi&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The savvy homeowner showed how she earnt easy money with a housing hack[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962543" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/make-2k-a-month-taken-808177906.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962543" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok/ scrunchyfi&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Despite her messy family living in the home, the woman was able to hide it from the guests[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikToker&lt;/a&gt; @scrunchyFi revealed the cash grab trick in a video, whilst she enjoyed the sunshine in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/5759251/costa-rica/"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage showed her abode that offered two small bedrooms, a bathroom and a common living area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/america/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; woman explained she lived in the house with her family but she used a simple trick when she wanted to rent it out for some extra savings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;This is how I rented my house for one month while I lived in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My house is a two-bedroom, one-bathroom duplex but I only rented out one room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I kept the kids&amp;#8217; room full of storage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I just shoved in all our personal belongings and the kids&amp;#8217; stuff and locked the door so the guests didn&amp;#8217;t have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And then they were able to use the rest of the house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So it is possible to rent out your house even if you have kids and a bunch of stuff &amp;#8211; all you got to do is shove it all into one room and lock the door.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The homeowner claimed she earned £2,200 in the month she rented it out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video has more than 700 views with other entrepreneurs admiring her hack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Damn awesome,&amp;#8221; a TikTok user said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t have someone in my house,&amp;#8221; another added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One family revealed how they &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21950656/family-four-live-converted-bus-love-not-paying-rent/"&gt;live in a converted bus full-time&lt;/a&gt;, and it even has a nursery for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another landlord revealed how she &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/21842620/rent-upstairs-home-pay-mortgage-rich/"&gt;rented the upstairs of her house &lt;/a&gt;to pay off her mortgage, which divided opinion online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21962549" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/make-2k-a-month-taken-808178066.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962549" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok/ scrunchyfi&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The woman claimed she earnt £2,200 in one month[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RUSSIA has threatened to attack the West&amp;#8217;s satellites in what would be a massive escalation of its war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s foreign ministry made the chilling threat as it accused unnamed forces of attacking their own orbital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VP-GRAPHIC-SATELLITE-WAR-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VP-GRAPHIC-SATELLITE-WAR-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=579" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21962334" width="579" height="960" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Destroying satellites could have wide ranging consequences such as disruption to communications systems, power grids, banking systems and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Military chiefs have previously warned it would no longer be &amp;#8220;life as we know it&amp;#8221; if war in space disrupted the world&amp;#8217;s satellite network. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; foreign ministry claimed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; has been disrupting their satellites with help from &amp;#8220;specialists from a number of foreign states&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is an outrageous violation of international law,” said the ministry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Russian side has the right to respond appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It warned: “All necessary possibilities for this are available.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry did not give&amp;nbsp;specific&amp;nbsp;examples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia has already accused the West of using its civilian space infrastructure to support the operations of the Ukrainian troops, including for combat strikes, for example detecting the locations of Vladimir Putin’s army and its movements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s country has also been &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21458570/vladimir-putin-speech-tv-blackout-russia/"&gt;under siege with a series of a hack attacks&lt;/a&gt; of TV and radio feeds, which often end with emergency warnings of nuclear war being broadcast to millions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The impact is seen as causing psychological trauma among the population and leading to a questioning of Putin’s war against Ukraine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In such cases, Russian officials have blamed the hacking on unknown groups. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not known if Moscow is also concerned about other breaches of its satellites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry did not specify how Russia might respond in any&amp;nbsp;attack on Western satellites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Satellites are crucial to telecommunications and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;global positioning system (GPS), as well as weather forecasting and disaster relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smartphones and the internet could be disrupted by attacks on the complex network of satellites linked to Western economies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And back in 2021, Russia destroyed one of its own satellites in orbit using a new type of missile. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lt Gen Nina Armagno, staff director of the US Space Force, last year laid out the danger of attacks on satellites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Life as we know it would no longer be as we know it,&amp;#8221; she warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don’t want to be dramatic. What does war in space look like? We probably won’t see it with our naked eye but we will definitely feel the consequences from the moment it begins.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Admiral&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19230983/russia-50k-troops-dead-ukraine-war/"&gt;Sir Tony Radakin&lt;/a&gt; also laid out the danger of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19972975/putin-could-carry-out-attacks-from-space-tony-radakin/"&gt;space weapons&lt;/a&gt; last September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[Russia] has capabilities in space. We saw an example of that at the tail end of last year, when Russia exploded an object in space which created immense debris,&amp;#8221; said Sir Tony. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia has increased its own cyber warfare and spy in the sky capability by boosting its military satellite capability during the war against Ukraine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage last week showed a Soyuz-2.1v launch from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Arkhangelsk region &amp;#8211; the latest in a succession of Defence Ministry payloads sent into orbit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vlad hasn&amp;#8217;t made the gains he or his commanders expected and Russia has found itself bogged down a long, brutal war as humiliating defeats pile up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tyrant now seemingly has his future tied to his success or failure in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin foolishly believed his forces would be welcomed into Ukraine as liberators when he invaded last February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead the initial attack ended in a disaster which saw his forces devastated and thrown back to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kyiv continues to call for Western support to help them defeat Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world is now awaiting to see if&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21907573/ukraine-tanks-challenger-2-bloodiest-battle/"&gt;Ukraine will mount its long expected counter offensive&lt;/a&gt;, with much of the fiercest fighting currently centred around the city of Bakhmut.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A PILOT was forced to make an emergency landing after a cobra slithered up his arm, leaving his passengers terrified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudolph Erasmus said he felt a cold sensation he thought was a water bottle but to his horror realised is it was one of the deadly serpents, whose bite can kill in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21960866" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 605px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/deadly-cobra-cockpit-forces-emergency-808155584.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=595" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960866" width="595" height="352" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rudolph Erasmus was at the controls of the plane when the snake appeared&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21960968" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 593px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/deadly-cobra-cockpit-forces-emergency-808155492.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=583" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960968" width="583" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Brian Emmenis/ GoldFM 104.3 Welkom&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The snake was pictured under the plane before it took off but was assumed to have slithered off[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21960949" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/deadly-cobra-cockpit-forces-emergency-808155493.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960949" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Brian Emmenis/ GoldFM 104.3 Welkom&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A snake handler was brought in to find the elusive serpent after the plane landed[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old pilot was carrying four passengers on a private flight in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-africa/"&gt;South Africa &lt;/a&gt;when the unexpected visitor appeared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I felt this cool sensation, sort of, crawling up my shirt,&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;he &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65188013"&gt;told the BBC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;To be truly honest, it&amp;#8217;s as if my brain did not register what was going on. As I turned to the left and looked down I saw the cobra.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then had to break the alarming news to those on board as he prepared to make an emergency landing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I did inform the passengers: &amp;#8216;Listen the snake is inside the aircraft, it&amp;#8217;s underneath my seat, so let&amp;#8217;s try and get down to the ground as soon as we can.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You could hear a needle drop and I think everyone froze for a moment or two.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Beechcraft Baron 58 was on its way from Bloemfontein to Pretoria but diverted to the city of Welkom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the relieved passengers and pilot rapidly got off the plane, a snake catcher was brought in to find the cobra.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the appearance of the snake was terrifying, it wasn&amp;#8217;t entirely surprising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the plane took off from Worcester flying club, two employees had spotted the snake underneath it and unsuccessfully tried to grab it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They even took a picture of the snake on the ground by one of the wheels, underneath an engine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erasmus looked for the snake before boarding the aircraft with his passengers, but &amp;#8220;unfortunately it was not there so he assumed it had slithered away&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We all then safely assumed that it must have crawled out overnight or earlier that morning, which was on Monday,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite the efforts of the snake handler and engineers who stripped the plane after it landed, the elusive serpent has yet to be found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erasmus’s cool handling of the situation has won the praise of Poppy Khosa, the South African Civil Aviation commissioner, who hailed him as a hero.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Oh my goodness this could have been disastrous. Great airmanship indeed which saved all lives on board,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Such an amazing story and great handling of the situation by the pilot. Bravo to great airmanship.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modest Erasmus himself brushed it off, saying “it&amp;#8217;s also my passengers that remained calm as well”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was definitely a first and not something you get trained to handle,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cape Cobra is found throughout in southern Africa, especially South Africa, Namibia and Angola, and its venom can kill in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults can measure up to 5ft long and are recognisable from their hood which is used to intimidate potential predators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cobra’s adventure comes after a python hitched a ride from Australia to the UK &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8504739/snakes-on-a-plane-to-glasgow/"&gt;in a tourist’s suitcase.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moira Boxall, from Stirling, found the spotted python in a shoe after returning from a family holiday in Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, passengers on board a flight in America were&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3146490/pet-snake-us-flight/"&gt;left horrified&lt;/a&gt; when a live snake was found on board by a young boy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been diagnosed with blood cancer &lt;/strong&gt;after a hospital dash. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire media mogul, 86, who has been in and out of the hospital in recent years, is currently in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/milan/"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s San Raffaele Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21960252" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/go-italy-silvio-berlusconi-arrives-379091611-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960252" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP or licensors&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Silvio Berlusconi is one of the most colourful characters in European politics[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21963035" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-berlusconi-stable-condition-second-808183774.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21963035" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;His daughter Marina Berlusconi arrives in hospital to see him[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21960318" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/general-view-intensive-care-unit-808029474.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21960318" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Berlusconi is hospitalised at the San Raffaele hospital in Italy[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Italian media reports he was hospitalised with pneumonia after a diagnosis of leukaemia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was admitted into hospital with heart problems and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is reported his condition is serious but stable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leukaemia is an aggressive and fast-acting cancer of the white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is undergoing intensive therapy to fight the disease, reports &lt;a href="https://www.corriere.it/politica/diretta-live/23_aprile_06/condizioni-berlusconi-oggi-diretta-64667d72-d436-11ed-b15d-00361b7c9d2d.shtml"&gt;Corriere della Sera&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former Prime Minister is the leader of the Forza Italia party which makes up part of the Italy&amp;#8217;s ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/"&gt;Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; who is worth an estimated $7billion &amp;#8211; however currently does not have a role in government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said: &amp;#8220;Sincere and affectionate wishes for a speedy recovery to Silvio Berlusconi. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Forza Silvio.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served as Prime Minister of Italy on three occasions, from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/"&gt;Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;reportedly spent four days at the same hospital last week for treatment, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2023/04/05/berlusconi-nuovamente-ricoverato-al-san-raffaele_2e860e53-a9a7-4952-b9b6-2d62f4661e91.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;news agency Ansa.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The politician shared a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;thanking people for their concern alongside a snap of him smiling at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi wrote: &amp;#8220;I have already returned to work on the main themes of these days, ready and determined to commit myself, as I always have, to the country I love.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire&amp;#8217;s latest hospital dash comes after a series of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;scares in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was hospitalised for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;-related pneumonia in September 2020, but later recovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the following year he was admitted several times for complications stemming from the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was forced to undergo open heart surgery in 2016 and surgery on his intestine three years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four-time prime minister, who is fitted with a pacemaker, has also overcome&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prostate-cancer/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his time in office hasn&amp;#8217;t been without controversy, as the party-loving former leader is well known for his sex scandals and eyebrow-raising jokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi &amp;#8211; who is in a relationship with Forza Italia MP Marta Fascina, 33 &amp;#8211; allegedly held lavish &amp;#8220;Bunga Bunga&amp;#8221; bashes at his villa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was accused, but later acquitted, of paying young women for &amp;#8220;silence and lies&amp;#8221; surrounding the infamous gatherings, which he always insisted were simply elegant dinners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But guests claimed they were in fact wild sex parties with &amp;#8220;orgies&amp;#8221;, where women stripped and performed &amp;#8220;raunchy pole dances&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;PLAYBOY PM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ex-PM, who previously described himself as the &amp;#8220;Jesus Christ of politics&amp;#8221;, also landed himself in hot water in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was alleged that the lothario had abused his position of power to protect a young Moroccan nightclub dancer who was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police detained Karima El-Mahroug, known by her stage name &amp;#8216;Ruby the Heart Stealer&amp;#8217;, for theft &amp;#8211; but she was released after Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was charged with paying her for sex when she was just 17 and was found guilty, until he was acquitted in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An appeals court ruled there was no proof he knew El-Mahroug was a minor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was also temporarily banned from politics after a conviction of tax fraud in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served a community sentence and muscled his way back into the spotlight before being re-elected as a senator in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi proved old habits died hard last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20756002/italian-prime-minister-silvio-berlusconi-prostitutes-monza/"&gt;promising his Monza players a &amp;#8220;bus full of prostitutes&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;if they beat AC Milan or Juventus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old, who owned&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1302934/ac-milan/"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;between 1986 and 2017,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7371758/ac-milan-silvio-berlusconi-serie-c-monza/"&gt;bought the team in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21951031/ex-italian-prime-minister-silvio-belusconi-intensive-care/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THIS is the moment diplomats from the UK and other countries stormed out of a UN meeting as a Russian mum branded &amp;#8220;Putin&amp;#8217;s child catcher&amp;#8221; spoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ex-music teacher &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18914766/russia-putins-childcatcher-kidnap-ukraine-youth-sanctions/"&gt;Maria Lvova-Belova&lt;/a&gt;, 38, is wanted on war crimes charges by the&amp;nbsp;International Criminal Court &amp;#8211; accused of abducting children&amp;nbsp;from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and sending them to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959703" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 890px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-reuters-com-world-europe-808071365.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=880" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959703" width="880" height="658" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Several ambassadors left the room as Marie Lvova-Belova, top right of screen, started speaking[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21757920" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/russian-president-vladimir-putin-meets-740789263.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21757920" width="960" height="635" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vladimir Putin and his &amp;#8216;child catcher&amp;#8217; Lvova-Belova[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She demanded an informal UN meeting to focus on &amp;#8220;evacuating children from conflict zones&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/us"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; blocked the informal conference from being webcast by the UN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diplomats from the countries and from Malta and Albania promptly left the room as Lvova-Belova started speaking to UN Security Council members by video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US joined Britain in blocking the webcast so Lvova-Belova did not have &amp;#8220;an international podium to spread disinformation and to try to defend her horrible actions that are taking place in Ukraine&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After returning to the room after Lvova-Belova had spoken, British diplomat Asima Ghazi-Bouillon told the meeting: &amp;#8220;Russia claims it is protecting these children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Instead this is a calculated policy that seeks to erase Ukrainian identity and statehood.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During her statement, Lvova-Belova showed footage of Ukrainian children in Russia, then said: &amp;#8220;I want to stress that unlike the Ukrainian side, we don&amp;#8217;t use children for propaganda.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ICC last month &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21751197/putin-arrest-warrant-international-criminal-court-ukraine/"&gt;issued arrest warrants for Lvova-Belova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; over their alleged involvement in the abductions of children from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A panel of judges agreed that there were &amp;#8220;reasonable grounds&amp;#8221; to believe that Vlad and his children&amp;#8217;s rights commissioner bore responsibility for the &amp;#8220;unlawful deportation&amp;#8221; of Ukrainian children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19791137/granddaughter-snatched-putins-troops-forced-russian-cleansed/"&gt;investigation by The Sun into Ukraine&amp;#8217;s missing children&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;back in September revealed that thousands of children have been deported during Putin&amp;#8217;s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&amp;#8217;s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, has said 16,226 children were deported and the country has managed to bring back just 308 of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage meanwhile emerged of Lvova-Belova &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21756955/putin-child-catcher-ukraine-russia-war-crimes-hague/"&gt;bragging as she talked about taking a boy from Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; during a meeting with Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since being appointed Putin&amp;#8217;s children&amp;#8217;s commissioner in 2021, she has portrayed the forced deportation of Ukrainian children as a Russian rescue mission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has adopted 18 children and also five biological kids with her husband, a Russian Orthodox priest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said last month that the informal meeting had been planned long before the ICC announcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said it was not intended to be a rebuttal of the charges against Putin and Lvova-Belova.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diplomats have said it is rare for a UN webcast to be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959700" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-diplomats-united-states-britain-808038283.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959700" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Lvova-Belova had demanded an informal UN meeting to focus on &amp;#8216;evacuating children from conflict zones&amp;#8217;[/caption]

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A DOZEN severed hands discovered in an ancient Egyptian palace could have been chopped off captured enemies while they were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists made the gruesome find in the courtyard of the palace in the city of Avaris which was inhabited by Hyksos people 3,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959907" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 406px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23370b9f-881a-4018-8e36-9d25775bb8ea.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=396" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959907" width="396" height="544" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Archaeologists found a number of hands in a palace courtyard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Research Gate - Scientific Reports&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959908" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 492px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/aa7b22d9-383e-4b1d-9a19-b10e72625669.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=482" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959908" width="482" height="239" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s thought the hands could have been chopped off while the people were still alive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Research Gate - Scientific Reports&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers now believe the hands may have been cut off as part of a grisly &amp;#8220;trophy-taking&amp;#8221; ritual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is likely the appendages were hacked off the right arms of 11 men and one woman, a study published by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32165-8" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt; reveals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is &amp;#8220;unclear&amp;#8221; whether the hands &amp;#8211; which were found in three pits &amp;#8211; were dissected from dead or alive individuals, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is believed royal members of the dynasty may have ordered for captured enemies to have their hands cut off and thrown in pits at a public ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study by German and Austrian researchers was led by paleopathologist Julia Gresky from the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their paper reads: &amp;#8220;Although this kind of practice is known from tomb or temple inscriptions and reliefs from the New Kingdom onwards, this is the first time that physical evidence has been used to learn more about the procedure and the individuals whose hands were taken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Here, we show that the right hands belonged to at least 12 adults, 11 males, and possibly one female.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The palace where the hands were discovered dates back to 1630BC, when the Hyksos dynasty ruled over much of &lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the hands came from at least 12 people &amp;#8211; although a number of lone fingers and incomplete hands could put the count up to 18.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amputation of right hands was recorded in tomb hieroglyphics, but this is the first physical evidence of the callous practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study adds: &amp;#8220;The Egyptians adopted this custom at the latest in&amp;nbsp;King Ahmose&amp;#8217;s reign, as shown by a relief of a pile of hands at his temple in Abydos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Severed hands offered in the &amp;#8216;gold of honour&amp;#8217; ceremony belonged to foes, generally male individuals of fighting age, killed in battle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At the same time, the presence of a female individual advocates for a less gender-rigid approach to the reconstruction of this procedure.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DOCTORS were rushed to help the woman accused of killing a pro-Putin blogger after she was interrogated for nine hours, it is reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daria Trepova, 26, was arrested after &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; propagandist &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, died&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday when a bomb ripped through a St Petersburg café where he was giving a talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959223" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 662px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darya-trepova-suspected-killing-russian-807792974.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=652" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959223" width="652" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Daria Trepova is being held by Putin&amp;#8217;s FSB after being accused of killing a Russian blogger[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931849" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 874px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/647784f5-c605-4e42-aec2-6459dd0eeab7.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=864" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931849" width="864" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The 26-year-old was arrested on Monday&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940408" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940408" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, real name Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb blast in St Petersburg[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The former art student was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21942121/statue-assassin-glass-cage-putin-blogger/"&gt;paraded in a glass cage on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; as she appeared in court in Moscow, charged with terrorist offences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is understood Trepova became disorientated and needed medical assistance as investigators interrogated her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She admitted giving a statuette to hardline war supporter Tatarsky, who had more than half a million social media followers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova has, however, denied being aware the gold-coloured statuette depicting Tatarsky was stuffed with explosives, it is understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was set up. I was just being used,” she reportedly told state investigators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova was subjected to nine hours of interrogation recorded on video after she was moved to Moscow where she was formally arrested, Ren TV &amp;#8211; which has close law enforcement contacts &amp;#8211; reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The channel claimed: &amp;#8220;During the interrogation Trepova complained of feeling unwell, saying that she could not hear well and could not get her bearings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Medics were called in to examine and assist Daria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“According to preliminary reports, the woman&amp;#8217;s condition may have been caused by concussion [as a result of the blast]&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova could be jailed for up to 20 years if convicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932672/russian-blogger-killed-video-st-petersburg/"&gt;Footage shows Tatarsky&lt;/a&gt; engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/"&gt;Trepova, who was arrested on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova appears to be trying to edge out of the room &amp;#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &amp;#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the café &amp;#8211; perhaps to shield herself &amp;#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further distressing footage appears to show the exact moment the bomb &amp;#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &amp;#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the café moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s health ministry said 40 other people had been injured in the blast, and 25 were still in hospital on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &amp;#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova&amp;#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it has been claimed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/"&gt;Putin personally ordered Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s assassination&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and will use it to crush his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, underground anti-establishment group, known as the National Republic Army (NRA), &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21945814/putin-rivals-claim-responsibility-russian-blogger-assassination/"&gt;appeared to claim to be behind&amp;nbsp;the attack.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940417" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497194-4.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940417" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trepova filmed moments after passing the statue to Tatarsky[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A WOMAN&amp;nbsp;with the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;#8217;s biggest lips has told how she loves her appearance &amp;#8211; but there&amp;#8217;s a massive downside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea Emilova Ivanova, 25 &amp;#8211; who has spent almost £20,000 on 43 procedures &amp;#8211; has recently had &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21487690/i-have-the-worlds-biggest-lips-set-new-record/#:~:text=Andrea%20Ivanova%2C%2025%2C%20claims%20to,aiming%20for%20cheekbones%20to%20match.&amp;amp;text=The%20Bulgarian%20Bratz%20doll%20lookalike,the%20%22world's%20biggest%20lips%22."&gt;four new hyaluronic acid injections in her cheekbones.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958094" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/000-getting-43-procedures-done-807972294.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958094" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;mediadrumimages&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She&amp;#8217;s revealed a downside to her extreme looks[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958096" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/000-getting-43-procedures-done-807972051.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958096" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;mediadrumimages&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Her lips overpower her entire face[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She gets her lips plumped every month to make sure they retain the title of biggest lips in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But her fame hasn&amp;#8217;t attracted a partner, and Andrea recently said she&amp;#8217;s willing to participate on a reality show like &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/the-bachelor/"&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/a&gt; to find &amp;#8220;the one&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has the attention of hundreds of thousands of men &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, but Andrea remains clueless about love.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “I am a girl with a different and an extravagant appearance and this is strange for many men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Of course there are many men who like me very much, but there are also those who do not like me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They think that I am strange and crazy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea revealed some men have offered free trips to their country, money and expensive dates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she still has a worry for her future partner: “I don&amp;#8217;t know if he will like girls like me with artificial beauty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He may turn out to be a connoisseur of natural beauty and that’s okay as everyone likes different things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But I am keen to surprise him with my good and kind behaviour and my good manners.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea’s love life hasn’t been a smooth road always and she has suffered her share of heartbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said it&amp;#8217;s difficult to find a soul mate when they are &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221; like she is &amp;#8211; but some still try.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea said: “I get marriage proposals on my social networks from men all over the world from different countries and continents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since I have changed my appearance, it has increased a lot.2&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrea’s dedication to beauty treatments is unmatched and her recent procedures are proof of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “I continue with the enlargement of the cheekbones as I want to achieve that ‘wow effect’ with them and I want them to be as huge as my lips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My current lips look really small according to me and I want to have much bigger lips than what I have now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Born and brought up in Burgas, Bulgaria, Andrea is a graduate student majoring in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/"&gt;German &lt;/a&gt;philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has always liked to be eccentric and loved different appearances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;#8217;t like boring ordinary appearances and I am a fan of huge shapes and eccentric beauties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Natural beauty is boring to me so I decided to change my appearance radically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to see myself with a drastic before and after look and I still have a lot of changes ahead of me as I haven&amp;#8217;t finished changing yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958106" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/000-getting-43-procedures-done-807972273.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958106" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;mediadrumimages&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She also has undergone breast augmentation[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958102" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/000-getting-43-procedures-done-807972143.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958102" width="720" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;mediadrumimages&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Hopefully she&amp;#8217;ll find her soul mate soon[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21959918" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 445px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e6b58a87-fa3e-4c16-bc9a-c4442a422d2e.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=435" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21959918" width="435" height="633" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;She looks unrecognisable in throwback pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;mediadrumimages/AndreaEmilovaIva&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A TIKTOK star has died at the age of 18 after battling a rare form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harrison Gilks, from &lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, had been documenting his mission to complete his bucket list on social media and built up a huge fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958156" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 478px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/teenage-tiktok-star-dies-rare-808051846.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=468" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958156" width="468" height="621" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;York &amp;amp; Miamichi Funeral Home&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;TikTok star Harrison Gilks died at the age of 18 after battling cancer[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958153" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/8e14ede1-f391-4c51-9434-6698c24db797.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958153" width="960" height="647" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;He shared updates on social media with his 300,000 followers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok - @harrisongilks1&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The social media influencer died &amp;#8220;peacefully&amp;#8221; on March 30 with his mum, dad and brother by his side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harrison suffered from&amp;nbsp;rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of cancer that forms in soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an emotional tribute, his heartbroken family hailed him an &amp;#8220;inspiration to many&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They said: &amp;#8220;His smile could light up a room, his laugh could cheer anyone up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He&amp;nbsp;was our sunshine on a cloudy day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He always found&amp;nbsp;good&amp;nbsp;in every situation and touched the lives of many with his messages of hope and encouragement through his TikTok videos, where he chronicled and shared his journey with cancer with the world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harrison was diagnosed with cancer in November 2020 and spent months undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was in remission in February 2022 but by June doctors said his cancer had returned and was untreatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brave Harrison decided to share his cancer battle on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a video posted last July, he said: &amp;#8220;This isn&amp;#8217;t the normal type of stuff I post, but I found out today that I have terminal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was cancer-free for a little bit, but unfortunately, it came back. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The reason I&amp;#8217;m making this and putting it out there is because I&amp;#8217;d like to make a little series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m gonna go out and do a bunch of stuff that I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to do, maybe skydiving, stuff along those lines.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He went on to share clips of him skiing, at a music festival, on trips around the world and taking a helicopter ride.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in his final video shared on March 21, Harrison told his followers from his hospital bed that his cancer had spread to his liver and one of his lungs had filled with fluid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s really hard to breathe. The doctors said I don&amp;#8217;t have a whole lot of time left. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll be in the hospital for the remainder of whatever time I have left.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s obviously very upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wish there was something that you guys could do, or I could do, or the doctors could do &amp;#8211; but there isn&amp;#8217;t. This is just the way it goes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The best thing you guys can do is pray for me. I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of praying. Pray for me and my family. It&amp;#8217;s been a great ride.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His brother David told the teen&amp;#8217;s fans of his death on his channel days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m making this video because Harrison sadly passed away a few hours ago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He was not in pain when he passed away and he was with his family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I just wanted to come on here and say thank you&amp;nbsp;to everybody around the world for their support and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A WOMAN who was missing for a week has been found on her boat, along with the body of her husband after he died of a suspected heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maria das Graças Mota Bernardo and José Nilson de Souza Bernardo, both 68, set off on the fishing trip on 28 March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21957384" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 792px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/maria-das-gra-mota-bernardo-808009867-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=782" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21957384" width="782" height="435" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The couple had set off for what was planned to be a lovely fishing trip[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21957605" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 722px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/005576ef-91af-4456-a581-9708139e080f.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=712" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21957605" width="712" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Instead, it ended in tragedy after José passed away&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple had planned to return two days later, but a search operation was launched when they failed to arrive home on time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They brought two vessels with them on the trip down an &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/amazon-rainforest/"&gt;Amazonian river &lt;/a&gt;called Rio Negro, in the heart of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They had a fishing boat and a smaller canoe for exploring flooded Amazonian forests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worried family members alerted the authorities when they discovered the couple’s canoe tied to a tree, with no sign of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rotting fish was found inside the canoe, and a net was still stretched out in the water to catch fish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Civil Police, the Navy and the local fire department then launched an extensive search operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On April 4, the Brazilian Navy found the couple’s vessel adrift in Iranduba, about 100 miles (161 km) from their departure point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maria had to spend several days alongside her beloved husband’s corpse after he apparently suffered a heart attack while fishing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Navy helicopter rescued Maria from the scene and officials administered first aid and support for the bereaved woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was then flown to Manaus for medical checks, while the fire department transported her husband’s corpse to a hospital morgue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Authorities will carry out an autopsy on the body to establish his exact cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navy confirmed that an investigation is underway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a woman drowned in a fishing boat tragedy off the coast of Brazil, just &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21308033/womans-tragic-selfie-moments-before-drowned/"&gt;hours after posting gleeful videos of her expedition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michele Bayerl de Moraes de Sena posed for a selfie video while out at sea, before a heavy storm hit the vessel she was in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tragically, the boat capsized, and she died alongside her husband Evandro Jose de Sena.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to reports, the six survivors avoided death by clinging to the hull after the boat capsized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were picked up by a passing vessel and given first aid.&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21308033/womans-tragic-selfie-moments-before-drowned/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A FIRE broke out at Russia&amp;#8217;s defence ministry as Vladimir Putin held talks just a short distance away at the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage shows thick plumes of black smoke billowing from the third-floor windows of the building in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956836" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 739px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/029f4855-3f89-4aaa-b838-2010ba6bec7a.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=729" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956836" width="729" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Smoke billowed from the Russia defence ministry building in Moscow&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956841" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/major-fire-breaks-russian-defence-808033746-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956841" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Some 50 people were evacuated from the site[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956739" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-right-808032987.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956739" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;It came as Putin met with ally Alexander Lukashenko[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Some 50 people were evacuated&amp;nbsp;as flames ripped through the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blaze was at a building known as Apraksin House, which has housed the administrative services of the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Defence since 1987.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is close to the headquarters of the defence ministry and is just several hundred yards from the Kremlin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; was holding talks nearby at the Kremlin with Belarus dictator &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15064105/who-belarus-president-alexander-lukashenko/"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ally in his war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cause of the inferno has not been confirmed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some reports said the section on fire was a department of military property dealing with facilities across the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, and is responsible for Putin’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as Putin welcomed Lukashenko to Moscow on Wednesday for two days of talks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in their opening public remarks both despots steered clear of the war in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine"&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week the two leaders would discuss Lukashenko&amp;#8217;s call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month Putin said Russia would deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin told Lukashenko in comments broadcast by state television: &amp;#8220;I must say that we have done a lot as a result of our joint work in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We will discuss all of this tomorrow &amp;#8211; this applies to our cooperation in the international arena and jointly solving questions of ensuring the security of our states.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s puppet Lukashenko &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21900216/putins-puppet-lukashenko-warns-nuclear-world-war/"&gt;issued a chilling warning to the West&lt;/a&gt; just days ago saying the Russian tyrant will spark a nuclear World War 3 if he faces defeat in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dictator said that&amp;nbsp;Russia, which is already sending&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21836020/vladimir-putin-sending-nuclear-weapons-belarus-nato-ukraine/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;tactical&amp;nbsp;nuclear weapons&amp;nbsp;to Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, could also send intercontinental nuclear missiles there as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressing lawmakers and government officials,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/alexander-lukashenko/"&gt;Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said Moscow&amp;#8217;s plans to station nuclear arms on its territory, would help protect Belarus, which he said was under threat from the West.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I am not trying to intimidate or blackmail anyone. I want to safeguard the Belarusian state and ensure peace for the Belarusian people.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a ranting speech,&amp;nbsp;Lukashenko&amp;nbsp;called for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in&amp;nbsp;Ukraine, cautioning that Russia would be forced to use &amp;#8220;the most terrible weapon&amp;#8221; if it felt threatened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;It is impossible to defeat a nuclear power. If the Russian leadership understands that the situation threatens to cause Russia&amp;#8217;s disintegration, it will use the most terrible weapon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This cannot be allowed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21900216/putins-puppet-lukashenko-warns-nuclear-world-war/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21106323/putin-air-defence-moscow-ukrainian-missile-strikes/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THIS is the bizarre moment Vladimir Putin spoke to ambassadors from 60 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes amid claims the paranoid tyrant, 70, is &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21923861/putins-health-stomach-pains-isnt-eating/"&gt;battling cancer and Parkinson&amp;#8217;s disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956112" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-delivers-808009687.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956112" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vladimir Putin stood some 60 feet away as he spoke to Moscow&amp;#8217;s new ambassadors[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956115" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-relations-russian-federation-us-808011331.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956115" width="960" height="649" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The tyrant, 70, is rumoured to be suffering from a number of health problems[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Footage shows &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; snubbing the new &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors of the US and EU as he refused to meet each of them to accept their credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He instead spoke from the other side of the gilded Alexander Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace in the capital some 60 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s distance demand is reminiscent of his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/"&gt;use of absurdly long tables&lt;/a&gt; for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lynne Tracy, from the US, and Roland Galharague, representing the EU, were among 17 new envoys at the ceremony, as were the new ambassadors of NATO states Norway and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin said he could not meet them in person due to “sanitary restrictions”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But during a visit to Mariupol last month the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; president was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21763044/putin-ukrainian-city-mariupol-arrest-warrant/"&gt;pictured standing close to the people&lt;/a&gt; he met with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking from a huge distance, Putin today told the new ambassadors:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“We won’t be able to talk in person, but in the course of your work, I’m sure this opportunity will come up again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dmitry Peskov, his spokesman, made clear Putin did not intend a hold separate ceremony with America’s first ever woman ambassador to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the ceremony, Putin said: “Sadly our ceremony is coming to an end because sanitary restrictions are still in force…&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We will not manage to speak face to face .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But I am sure we’ll have this chance multiple times during your work here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am wishing you all the best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin is rumoured to be battling several health issues &amp;#8211; with speculation fuelled by his often&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/"&gt;bloated look&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/"&gt;twitching feet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20160557/putin-parkinsons-pancreatic-cancer-russian-insider-reveals/"&gt;Bombshell spy documents leaked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to The Sun meanwhile previously appeared to confirm the dictator has pancreatic cancer and early-stage&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/"&gt;Parkinson&amp;#8217;s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And his ex-bodyguard Gleb Karakulov this week claimed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21935894/putin-hides-in-bunkers-dodge-assassination-terrified-of-covid/"&gt;Putin hides in bunkers to dodge assassination&lt;/a&gt; attempts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov, 35, also claimed the despot is &amp;#8220;morally afraid&amp;#8221; of dying of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said Putin turned into a recluse after becoming obsessed with securing his safety &amp;#8211; and being rattled by fears the West are bugging his calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The captain in the Federal Guard Service, known as the FGS or FSO, has fled Russia to safety after dishing the dirt on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s regime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He branded the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;President a &amp;#8220;war criminal&amp;#8221; and claimed he has brainwashed his minions to &amp;#8220;worship him in every way&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as Putin tries to keep a grip on his power, Karakulov claims he is also battling his own inner demons in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18097861/paranoid-putin-living-top-secret-nuke-bunkers-nuclear-war/"&gt;complete isolation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He alleged that the warlord now opts to stay &amp;#8220;in his bunker&amp;#8221; rather than make trips like he used to &amp;#8211; fuelling rumours that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21809587/video-proving-putin-uses-body-doubles-goes-viral/"&gt;he send body doubles in his place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956135" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vladimir-putin-accepts-credentials-17-808024067.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956135" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Putin refused to meet each of the representatives[/caption]</content:encoded>

&lt;figure id="attachment_21955989" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 802px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fans-shocked-jacked-i-60-789035205.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=792" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21955989" width="792" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram/ Dorian Yates&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Known as &amp;#8216;The Shadow&amp;#8217;, he dominated the sport in the 1990s[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Dorian has competed among big names in his sport, including Ronnie Coleman, Flex Wheeler and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He later went on to win Mr Olympia six times in a row in the 1990s, and he attributes his winning mindset to his tracksuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a snap shared to his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, he told how the bright blue matching track set allowed him to enter a champion&amp;#8217;s mindset.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorian said: &amp;#8220;Here’s a shot where I was warming up backstage wearing my Tardis tracksuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I actually named this particular tracksuit, The Tardis… the police telephone box from the popular &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/science-fiction/"&gt;British TV sci-fi series, Dr. Who.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Only really my inner circle knew why I named the tracksuit The Tardis, here’s why.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorian went on to explain how in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/doctor-who/"&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/a&gt;, The Tardis is bigger on the inside than the outside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By wearing the tracksuit which made him appear smaller than he was, he showed up his opponents and threw them off before competitions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorian reflected: &amp;#8220;I wore it to deliberately give an image of a ‘smaller’ physique to confuse my rivals and people would comment, asking each other why I wasn’t bigger, as they were expecting me to be… little did everyone know, I’d probably be a career heaviest!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I always left my tracksuit on until the very last minute as I would feel every eye glancing at me from my competitors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When it eventually was time for The Tardis to come off, my gargantuan physique was unveiled for all to see.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tactic clearly led Dorian to victory, as he went to have an incredibly successful career throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;My competitors have often said that it felt like there was a force field around me that roared victory… I almost felt unbeatable.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorian earned the nickname &amp;#8220;The Shadow&amp;#8221; for his tendency to sneak up on his opponents and win titles easily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow big name bodybuilder &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21743799/80-year-old-bodybuilder-unrecognisable-heyday-still-working/"&gt;Frank Zane recently shared photos&lt;/a&gt; from his heyday, and he looks unrecognisable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though he&amp;#8217;s now 80, Frank continues to work out each day to keep up his physique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpznZYvjEHs/"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a picture from his heyday, he wrote: &amp;#8220;A lot of guys have better genes but if you work hard and consistently, you can outperform them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tactic has clearly worked for Zane, who won the esteemed Mr Olympia and Mr Universe titles&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/6850405/three-time-mr-olympia-frank-zane-bodybuilder-unrecognizable/"&gt;three times each.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through his 50 year-long career, he has worked alongside other legends in the business, including Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, he is often found sharing his wisdom online and acting as a performance coach for millions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CHINA sailed its aircraft carrier strike fleet off the Taiwan coast in a chilling warning to the US as tensions boil over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as President Tsai Ing-wen defied threats from Beijing and today met &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/us"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/los-angeles/"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21955625" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pla-navy-led-aircraft-carrier-808001421.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21955625" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A Taiwanese navy ship crew member monitoring China&amp;#8217;s aircraft carrier fleet[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21955645" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/moment-china-sends-aircraft-carrier-808023404-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21955645" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Ministry of National Defense&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;An image of China&amp;#8217;s carrier taken from the air[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21956540" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/house-speaker-kevin-mccarthy-r-808031916.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21956540" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;It came hours before Taiwan&amp;#8217;s leader Tsai Ing-wen met in Los Angeles with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, which has long claimed democratically-governed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; as its own territory, has warned of unspecified retaliation if the meeting goes ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last August, Beijing staged war games around Taiwan following the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19400622/china-taiwan-latest-military-operations-nancy-pelosi-visit/"&gt;visit to Taipei of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;#8217;s defence ministry said the Chinese ships, which were led by the carrier the Shandong, passed through the Bashi Channel &amp;#8211; which separates Taiwan from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group then went into waters to Taiwan&amp;#8217;s southeast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It said the ships were going for training in the Western Pacific, and that Taiwanese naval and air forces and land-based radar systems closely monitored them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said: &amp;#8220;The Chinese communists continue to send aircraft and ships to encroach in the seas and airspace around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In addition to posing a substantial threat to our national security, it also destroys the status quo of regional security and stability. Such actions are by no means the acts of a responsible modern country.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One picture provided by the ministry shows a grainy black and white image of the carrier taken from the air.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other meanwhile shows a Taiwanese sailor looking at the Shandong and another unidentified ship in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China has yet to comment on the carrier group, whose appearance also coincided with the arrival in Beijing of French President Emmanuel Macron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March of last year, the Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait, just hours before the Chinese and US presidents were due to talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;#8217;s defence ministry, in its statement about the Shandong&amp;#8217;s latest mission near the island, said that &amp;#8220;external pressure will not hinder our determination to go into the world&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country&amp;#8217;s military will continue to closely monitor the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and uphold the principles of &amp;#8220;not escalating conflicts, not causing disputes&amp;#8221; to deal with any challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy today in California.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is the most senior US figure to meet a Taiwanese leader on U.S. soil since 1979 despite threats of retaliation from China.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said there was nothing new about a Taiwanese president transiting through the America and Beijing should not use it as an excuse to take action or ratchet up tensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporters waving Taiwan flags and pro-Taiwan and Hong Kong banners chanted Jiayou Taiwan &amp;#8211; the equivalent of &amp;#8220;Go Taiwan&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; in the Reagan Library parking lot ahead of their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After McCarthy and Tsai went inside, a small plane flew over the library towing a pro-Beijing banner saying &amp;#8220;One China! Taiwan is part of China!&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The meeting is expected to draw a strong reaction from Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory and has vowed to bring it under its control, by force if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China has repeatedly warned against a meeting between McCarthy and Tsai, who is on her first US stopover since 2019,.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it is feared it may already be too late to stop&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21661092/putin-boosting-china-nuclear-arsenal/"&gt;President Xi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;unleashing a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2302257/pearl-harbor-time-attack-bomb/"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;-style surprise before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the danger was laid bare as &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21753359/taiwanese-soldiers-war-games-chinese-skyscrapers-invasion/"&gt;The Sun visited the front line&lt;/a&gt; at Taiwan-controlled&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19413271/china-live-fire-drills-taiwan-strait/"&gt;Kinmen Island&lt;/a&gt;, just two miles from the Chinese coast, in March.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explosions and gunfire could be heard as Taiwanese troops trained at secret military installations hidden from public view along the coastline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miles of spiked steel sea defences pointing towards China lined beaches ready to repel an amphibious landing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chinese drones have been taunting troops defending the island in recent months as spy ships disguised as trawlers lurked offshore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strategy echoes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin’s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;behaviour before he ordered&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20888209/ukraine-news-latest-war-russia-putin/"&gt;Russian forces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into Ukraine last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Lin Ching-Yi, a legislator on Taiwan’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told The Sun: “They are exactly the same tactics as Russia’s before the Ukraine invasion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An information war sews doubt and interferes with the democratic process and we now have serious fears that military action will follow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Xi and Putin are both old men who want to make history and leave a lasting legacy. If Xi wants to achieve the unification (of China and Taiwan) that he has promised during his lifetime, that could mean war very soon. We need to be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MORE than 80 years ago, Finland slaughtered 200,000 invading Russians with its rudimentary forces &amp;#8211; today it boasts one of the most terrifying arsenals in the northern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/finland/"&gt;Nordic country&lt;/a&gt; became the 31st member of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt; as it vowed to protect the alliance&amp;#8217;s borders in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21953629" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russia-invaded-ukraine-new-iron-807619164.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21953629" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s defence force is one of the most revered in the northern hemisphere[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21953654" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2022-near-rovaniemi-finland-finland-792578574.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21953654" width="960" height="628" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;It has more than 650 tanks on hand ready for battle[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21955611" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/finnish-troops-wearing-gas-masks-734668392.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21955611" width="960" height="736" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The Finns also have an elite ski troop[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21929505/russia-vows-ramp-up-forces-finland-border-joins-nato/"&gt;ascension to The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&lt;/a&gt; is set to bolster the west&amp;#8217;s military capabilities with its developed defence force.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s not just its excess of war-ready machines that is to be feared, footage has emerged of its &lt;a aria-label="elite ski troops (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1643127811765415936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;elite ski troops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The angry Finnish soldiers were seen powering through thick powder as they carried huge packs and weapons &amp;#8211; ready to kill their enemy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to military experts, Finland is one of the most combat-ready forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also one of few &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; countries to have retained a conscription army through decades of peace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland trains 21,000 new conscripts every year, who then become part of its troop reserve of 280,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the country has 870,000 Finns aged between 17 and 60 liable for service in case of need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are all trained and equipped with one primary aim &amp;#8211; to repel any Russian invasion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s ground force boasts 650 tanks with about 200 of them being German-made Leopards types 2A6 and 2A4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its impressive artillery has more than 1,500 weapons including 700 howitzers, 700 mortars and about 100 rocket launchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Finnish Air Force and Navy is also not to be scoffed at &amp;#8211; commanding impressive fleets in both regards, which are set to grow within the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as the Nato chief praised the Finns during their official ascension on April 4, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4425500/nato-secretary-world-is-in-danger/"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt;, secretary general of Nato, said: &amp;#8220;President Putin started the war against Ukraine with the clear goal of having less Nato [near Russia&amp;#8217;s borders].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He is getting exactly the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We will raise the Finnish flag for the first time here at Nato headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It will be a good day for Finland&amp;#8217;s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Finnish contribution will add more than 257,000 troops to the combined forces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move has also roughly doubled the West&amp;#8217;s transatlantic frontier facing &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland and Russia share a painful 810 mile border with one another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; condemned the new alliance and has threatened to bolster its border defences in the western region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it was not that long ago when the Soviet Union suffered huge losses on that same demarcation line &amp;#8211; known as the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18642730/worlds-deadliest-ever-sniper-the-white-death-lesson-putin/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Winter War&amp;#8221;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November 1939, the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17791194/which-countries-soviet-union/"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; with its millions of men, tens of thousands of tanks and aircraft invaded Finland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Soviets wanted a lease on the Hankö peninsula on the southern Finnish coast for use as a naval base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But with less than a tenth of its counterparts army, the small country refused to cede and fought back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One Finnish sniper in particular, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18642730/worlds-deadliest-ever-sniper-the-white-death-lesson-putin/"&gt;&amp;#8220;The White Death&amp;#8221;,&lt;/a&gt; terrorised the invading forces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simo Hayha shot dead more than 500 Russian soldiers during the battle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a conflict that has become infamous as the brave Finnish troops managed to rout the much larger Russian army &amp;#8211; leaving 70,000 dead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unbelievable feat is still celebrated today in Finland and lingers as a cautionary tale for &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; men.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AT least four children have been killed after a man armed with an axe went on a rampage at a nursery in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old, named locally as Luiz Henrique de Lima, arrived at the preschool in Blumenau in Santa Catarina on a motorbike before leaping over the wall and storming the building.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21953945" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-invaded-daycare-center-hatchet-808007584.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21953945" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Horrified parents were seen weeping outside the school&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21954233" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 749px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-invaded-daycare-center-hatchet-808014864.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=739" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21954233" width="739" height="415" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A man armed with an axe stormed the preschool in Blumenau&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21953442" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 296px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/agssgfgdshgfdhgdshgfdhfj-1.png?strip=all&amp;amp;w=286" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21953442" width="286" height="206" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Footage shared online showed emergency services at the scene&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21954221" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-invaded-daycare-center-hatchet-808014721.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21954221" width="960" height="504" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The attack at the Cantinho do Bom Pastor preschool left four children dead&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21958832" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 781px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pic-shows-luiz-henrique-de-808060870.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=771" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21958832" width="771" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A 25-year-old man, named locally as Luiz Henrique de Lima, handed himself in after the attack[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The attack happened on Wednesday morning at the Cantinho do Bom Pastor preschool in the Velha area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video footage shared online shows emergency services outside the school as parents escort their kids away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other footage too horrifying to show appears to show bodies under sheets in the playground. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The suspected attacker left four children &amp;#8211; three boys and a girl &amp;#8211; dead before turning himself in at a police station, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young victims were named as Bernardo Cunha Machado, five, Bernardo Padbt da Cunha, four, Larissa Maia Toldo, seven, and four-year-old Enzo Marchesin Barbosa, &lt;a aria-label="G1 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://g1.globo.com/sc/santa-catarina/noticia/2023/04/05/ataque-creche-blumenau.ghtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A fifth child is said to be in serious condition while four other casualties were taken to Santo Antonio Hospital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hospital said the four injured children are up to two years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said a 25-year-old man responsible for the attack had been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker had a history of violence and drugs, and had stabbed his stepfather in March 2021, cops added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A brave teacher Simone Aparecida Camargo told NSC TV how she tried to save her class by hiding the children in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;We thought it was a robbery because he invaded the school, but I locked the babies in the bathroom, then they came to the door saying that he &amp;#8216;he came to kill, he went to the park to kill.'&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The police are currently working to determine whether there are more people involved in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images broadcast on television showed weeping parents outside the private daycare centre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worried parents were pictured people waiting behind a security cordon as an officer asked the crowd to remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called the attack a &amp;#8220;monstrosity&amp;#8221;, dubbing it an &amp;#8220;unacceptable, absurd act of hate and cowardice&amp;#8221; against &amp;#8220;innocent, defenceless children,&amp;#8221; in a Twitter post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Santa Catarina state&amp;#8217;s Gov. Jorginho Mello confirmed the killings in the city of Blumenau on his Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is with immense sadness that I received the terrible news that the Good Shepherd preschool in Blumenau was invaded by a murderer who attacked children and employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Unfortunately, four were killed,&amp;#8221; he said in a statement, declaring three days of mourning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, a student in Sao Paulo stabbed a teacher, killing her, and also wounding several others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;May God comfort the hearts of all families in this moment of deep pain,&amp;#8221; Gov. Mello wrote on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blumenau, a city of 366,000 people, is famous for its annual Oktoberfest festival.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE United States today deployed a fleet of nuclear bombers and fighter jets over North Korea in a chilling warning to Kim Jong-un. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The formidable B-52 bombers&amp;nbsp;flew to the Korean Peninsula in a show of strength after the dictator vowed to &amp;#8220;plunge his rivals into despair.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21952695" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000682290254.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21952695" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Alamy&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The US sent a fearsome fleet of B-52 bombers over the Korean Peninsula today[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21952690" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fire-fury-us-deploys-nuclear-808000089.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21952690" width="960" height="618" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The nation also teamed up with South Korea for joint anti-submarine drills this week[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21952923" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/north-koreas-leader-kim-jong-654476890.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21952923" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;It comes amid fears Kim Jong un is planning North Korea&amp;#8217;s first nuclear test since 2017[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/us/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; long-range planes took part in joint aerial drills with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-korea/"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was the first deployment of the B-52 bombers to the peninsula in a month, South Korea&amp;#8217;s Defense Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can be fitted with nuclear-able cruise missiles and precision air-to-surface rockets, as well as carrying more than 30 tonnes of bombs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drills were a direct jab at brutal tyrant &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-jong-un/"&gt;Kim Jong Un&lt;/a&gt;, amid&amp;nbsp;fears that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;might conduct its first nuclear test since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21910909/satellite-high-activity-north-korean-nuclear/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The countries teamed up to &amp;#8220;show the strong resolve of the (South) Korea-U.S. alliance and its perfect readiness to respond to any provocation by&amp;nbsp;North Korea&amp;nbsp;swiftly and overwhelmingly,&amp;#8221; Lt. Gen. Park Ha Sik, commander of the South Korean air force operation command, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both nations have bolstered their combined military drills in response to North Korea&amp;#8217;s mounting threats of unleashing missiles and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nuclear-weapons/"&gt;nukes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last week, the US sent the nuclear-powered USS Nimitz aircraft carrier for joint naval training with South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was followed by the parade in the skies of the B-52 bombers as well as anti-submarine drills this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rear Adm. Christopher Sweeney said the maritime exercises were &amp;#8220;a tangible symbol of a shared goal in ensuring regional stability and economic well-being for all nations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The commander of Carrier Strike Group 11 added: &amp;#8220;The U.S., Japan, and Korea are three maritime nations who share a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific by working together to develop mutual trust, partnership, and capability.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But North Korea is gearing up for an ambush on all fronts &amp;#8211; and claims to have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21820394/north-korea-tests-nuclear-underwater-drone-radioactive-tsunami/"&gt;tested a new nuclear underwater attack drone that triggers a &amp;#8220;radioactive tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; in early March. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21910909/satellite-high-activity-north-korean-nuclear/"&gt;Disturbing satellite pictures also showed a flurry of activity&lt;/a&gt; at the country&amp;#8217;s main nuclear complex in the wake of Kim&amp;#8217;s latest threats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The images emerged soon after he&amp;nbsp;ordered increased production of bomb fuel to expand his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/"&gt;rogue state&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;nuclear weapons arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The allies conducted their &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21693417/biggest-war-games-north-korean-border-submarine-salvo/"&gt;biggest field exercises in five years last month&lt;/a&gt;, practicing war games with computer simulations and field training exercises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures showed tanks and choppers readying for drills at a training field in the border city of Yeoncheon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This further riled Kim, who accused the US of preparing to invade his homeland and said he would squash their plot with &amp;#8220;the toughest counteraction&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He ordered his troops to be on standby to respond to the &amp;#8220;frantic war preparation moves&amp;#8221; from the US and South Korea &amp;#8211; which he views as an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21250803/kim-jong-un-nuke-for-nuke-confrontation-red-line/"&gt;invasion rehearsal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the drills kicked off, North Korea fired two cruise missiles from a submarine off its east coast in an apparent retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;views the military exercises as a major security threat, America and South Korea said the drills are defensive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kim was last week seen inspecting nuclear warheads at a secret location amid his vows to build up his country&amp;#8217;s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same day he unveiled new, smaller nuclear warheads intended to be fitted onto smaller weapons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not known whether these miniature nuclear warheads are fully developed but such weapons are part of Kim&amp;#8217;s larger nuclear plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US has beefed up its alliances in the region amid North Korea&amp;#8217;s increasing nuclear threats, with more than 70 missile tests last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the last year, Kim has been steadily expanding his nuclear arsenal and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21497734/north-korea-fires-missile-show-nuclear-combat-force/"&gt;unleashed a barrage of banned missile tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts said Kim is trying to pressure the US into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear power and relax international economic sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21952693" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fire-fury-us-deploys-nuclear-808000148.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21952693" width="960" height="761" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The US, Japan and South Korea conducted maritime exercises in the East China Sea[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21952691" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fire-fury-us-deploys-nuclear-808000145.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21952691" width="960" height="615" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The soaring number of drills is increasingly aggravating Kim Jong un[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FOR most people under the age of 30 the idea of owning a house, never mind becoming a billionaire, remains a distant dream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not so for a select group of very wealthy millennials, who now count among the world’s 2640 billionaires in the new &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2023/04/04/forbes-37th-annual-worlds-billionaires-list-facts-and-figures-2023/"&gt;Forbes Rich list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21951375" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-instagram-com-kgandresen-807980501.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21951375" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;.instagram/kgandresen/&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Billionaire Katharina Andresen drinking champagne[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The source of their wealth ranges from fish farming to gaming with some building up successful businesses and others inheriting their fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are 28 fewer US dollar billionaires, the currency used by Forbes in its list this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the top of the overall list is luxury goods titan&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21724754/who-bernard-arnault-net-worth/"&gt; Bernard Arnault&lt;/a&gt;, 74, who has an astronomical $211 billion (£168 billion) fortune from his Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LMVH) company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But beneath that stratospheric level of wealth there are some younger billionaires who aren’t doing too badly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among them is Gustav Magnar Witzoe, who turned 30 this year and owns nearly half of Salmar ASA, one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest salmon producers, worth $2.7 billion (£2.1 billion)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stake in the salmon empire was given to him by his dad, also named Gustav, who founded the company in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His son puts his chiselled good looks to use as a part-time model and his Instagram features him on the catwalk during New York Fashion Week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gustav Magnar Witzoen has a fondness for fast cars and has been pictured behind the wheel of a vintage Aston Martin and a Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images have shown him globetrotting in style, touching down on everywhere from Italy and France to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while he’s not afraid to show off his wealth, he is also proud of the fact he wasn’t spoiled by his parents and had a relatively modest upbringing while his dad built up the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He skipped university and put himself to work on salmon farms for two years to learn the trade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another young billionaire who’s not shy about flaunting her lifestyle is Katharina Andresen, who along with her sister Alexandra, is worth $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair owe their wealth to a stake in their family’s investment company Ferd.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her Instagram also shows her in posing various exotic locations and quaffing champagne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 2017 she was fined £23,000 for drink driving but told a court she had no fixed income as her assets &amp;#8220;have not yielded any dividend yet&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sole Brit on the list is &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19953855/millionaire-lavish-life-ben-francis-gymshark-model-wife/"&gt;Ben Francis&lt;/a&gt;, who made his fortune through the fitness wear brand&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20037170/plus-size-woman-gym-shark-haul-xxl-fit/"&gt;Gymshark&lt;/a&gt;, which he founded in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many on the billionaire list, his is a genuine rags-to-riches story to which has seen him build a brand &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/17680844/gymshark-bestselling-workout-athleisure/"&gt;worn by some of the biggest celebrities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The businessman married Canadian fitness model and influencer Robin in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pair have given fans a glimpse into their VIP lifestyle through sharing pictures of their extravagant holidays, including one on the island of K&amp;#8217;gari in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other posts see them in Dubai, where they are photographed in an opulent restaurant and on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Ben was embroiled in a drug scandal when a video surfaced of him snorting cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben is known for his love of motorcycles and has given fans a look at some of his expensive bikes, including one by Thornton Hundred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also on the list are the Del Vecchio brothers Leonardo, Luca and Clemente, who own their $3.5 billion (£2.8 billion) wealth to a stake in the Luxottica eyewear brand founded by their dad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leonardo Del Vecchio has been pictured partying at the Pacha nightclub in Ibiza and with Ferrari racing cars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third set of siblings on the list are sisters Kim Jung-min and Kim Jung-youn, who inherited their $1.1 billion (£900 million) fortune from their dad Kim Jung-ju.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 54-year-old online gaming tycoon died last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of their fortunes are dwarfed by Mark Mateschitz, who received a 49 per cent share in the drinks company Red Bull, when his dad Dietrich&amp;nbsp;passed away,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the tender age of 30, he now has a $34.7 billion (£27 billion) fortune.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arnault has leaped Elon Musk to become the world’s wealthiest person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Musk, 51, is worth $180 billion (£144 billion) a fall of $39 billion (£31 billion) on 2022 after his controversial &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; takeover and complications with electric car-maker &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tesla/"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making it &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/21943978/rihanna-kim-kardashian-jay-z-forbes-billionaire-kanye-west/"&gt;back on to the list&lt;/a&gt; is singer Rihanna, 35, thanks to the success of her&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/14363338/rihanna-cheeky-savage-x-fenty-set/"&gt;Savage X Fenty underwear range&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19062614/rihanna-fenty-beauty-where-to-buy/"&gt;Fenty cosmetics collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=39704&amp;#038;game=polling"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One notable absentee is rapper&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kanye-west/"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, who was dropped by Adidas from a deal reported to be worth $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/20223149/kanye-west-anti-semitic-remarks-addidas/"&gt;for making anti-Semitic comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His ex-wife &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-kardashian/"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt; is 2,259th on the list, now in its 37th year, but her $1.1 billion (£960 million) fortune is down $54 million (£44 million) on 2021 when she first appeared on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A RUSSIAN war fanatic who spent £20,000 on drones for Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s troops has received a batch of sex toys after his purchase was hacked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/"&gt;pro-Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; muscovite raised the funds with hopes to progress &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; failed invasion but his plans were thwarted by &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; cyber forces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21950766" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ukrainian-cyber-warriors-hacked-account-807984193.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21950766" width="960" height="538" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russian war fanatic Mikhail Luchin tried to order drones to help Putin&amp;#8217;s army[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21950759" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ukrainian-cyber-warriors-hacked-account-807984049.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21950759" width="960" height="334" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;His plans were thwarted by hackers and instead received a bunch of sex toys, pictured[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;According to Mikhail Luchin, who claims to be a &amp;#8220;Z-volunteer&amp;#8221;, the order for the military-grade devices was placed with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; online retail giant AliExpress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, instead of receiving a large consignment of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/drones/"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; he received a bunch of &amp;#8220;dildos&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Strap-Ons&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Cyber Resistance Group claimed responsibility for the online hack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group told InformNapalm: &amp;#8220;He collected money and spent it on the purchase of drones for the Russian army.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So it was important to write it off for something else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We decided to order him a bunch of sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So instead of drones, Mikhail will now send to the invaders trucks of dildos, strap-ons and other things useful to every Russian that we ordered and paid for with his card on AliExpress.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The twisted &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;-devotee said he failed to get a refund for the toys. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Via his social media, Mikhail said: &amp;#8220;I will open a sex shop here&amp;nbsp;[Russia], make 300 per cent profit and buy three times more drones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It would be good to have a Kalibr missile.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the face of Mikhail&amp;#8217;s impotent plans, cyber warfare has played a major role in Ukraine&amp;#8217;s efforts to hold on to its land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a British spy chief said the two countries were locked in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19945075/ukraine-russia-worlds-biggest-ever-cyber-war-moscows-faltering/"&gt;the biggest cyber war the world&lt;/a&gt; has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion, Putin’s army of hackers unleashed a barrage of &amp;#8220;major cyber attacks&amp;#8221; and a disinformation blitz to sow chaos and confusion in support of their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;bloodbath &lt;/a&gt;operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the strikes &amp;#8220;have largely failed&amp;#8221; thanks to&amp;nbsp;Ukraine’s&amp;nbsp;heroic cyber defenders, Lindy Cameron, the boss of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together with its allies, the western keyboard warriors saved lives, &amp;#8220;in the face of sophisticated and sustained&amp;nbsp;Russian&amp;nbsp;cyber aggression&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;Just as we have seen inspirational and heroic defence by&amp;nbsp;Ukrainian&amp;nbsp;military on the battlefield, we have seen incredibly impressive defensive cyber operations by Ukrainian cyber security practitioners.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unseen blitz in cyberspace is &amp;#8220;probably the most sustained and intensive cyber campaign on record, with the Russian state launching a series of major&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cyber-crime-hacking/"&gt;cyber attacks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in support of their illegal invasion,&amp;#8221; she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, hacking group Anonymous claimed it released the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18160552/anonymous-russia-leak-soldiers-putin-ukraine-war/"&gt;details of 120,000 Russian soldiers&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine to throw off the invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FORMER Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been rushed to intensive care after suffering from heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire media mogul, 86, who has been in and out of the hospital in recent years, is currently in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/milan/"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s San Raffaele Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21951003" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RM-silvio-op.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21951003" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Berlusconi is in intensive care after suffering from some heart problems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21951571" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/general-view-shows-san-raffaele-807989039.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21951571" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He is receiving treatment at Milan&amp;#8217;s San Raffaele Hospital, where he was also admitted last week[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Reports claim he was admitted on Wednesday morning and his current condition is &amp;#8220;stable&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/silvio-berlusconi/"&gt;Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; reportedly spent four days at the same hospital last week for treatment, according to &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2023/04/05/berlusconi-nuovamente-ricoverato-al-san-raffaele_2e860e53-a9a7-4952-b9b6-2d62f4661e91.html" target="_blank"&gt;news agency Ansa.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local media said that the leader of the right-wing Forza Italia party was suffering from heart issues and was discharged on March 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The politician shared a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; thanking people for their concern alongside a snap of him smiling at home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi wrote: &amp;#8220;I have already returned to work on the main themes of these days, ready and determined to commit myself, as I always have, to the country I love.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His party is a key part of prime minister &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19927100/italy-georgia-meloni-leader-mussolini-fan/"&gt;Giorgia Meloni’&lt;/a&gt;s conservative government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The billionaire&amp;#8217;s latest hospital dash comes after a series of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; scares in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was hospitalised for &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;-related pneumonia in September 2020, but later recovered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the following year he was admitted several times for complications stemming from the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was forced to undergo open heart surgery in 2016 and surgery on his intestine three years later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four-time prime minister, who is fitted with a pacemaker, has also overcome &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/prostate-cancer/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But his time in office hasn&amp;#8217;t been without controversy, as the party-loving former leader is well known for his sex scandals and eyebrow-raising jokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi &amp;#8211; who is in a relationship with Forza Italia MP Marta Fascina, 33 &amp;#8211; allegedly held lavish &amp;#8220;Bunga Bunga&amp;#8221; bashes at his villa. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was accused, but later acquitted, of paying young women for &amp;#8220;silence and lies&amp;#8221; surrounding the infamous gatherings, which he always insisted were simply elegant dinners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But guests claimed they were in fact wild sex parties with &amp;#8220;orgies&amp;#8221;, where women stripped and performed &amp;#8220;raunchy pole dances&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;PLAYBOY PM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ex-PM, who previously described himself as the &amp;#8220;Jesus Christ of politics&amp;#8221;, also landed himself in hot water in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was alleged that the lothario had abused his position of power to protect a young Moroccan nightclub dancer who was arrested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police detained Karima El-Mahroug, known by her stage name &amp;#8216;Ruby the Heart Stealer&amp;#8217;, for theft &amp;#8211; but she was released after Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was charged with paying her for sex when she was just 17 and was found guilty, until he was acquitted in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An appeals court ruled there was no proof he knew El-Mahroug was a minor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi was also temporarily banned from politics after a conviction of tax fraud in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He served a community sentence and muscled his way back into the spotlight before being re-elected as a senator in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlusconi proved old habits died hard last year after &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20756002/italian-prime-minister-silvio-berlusconi-prostitutes-monza/"&gt;promising his Monza players a &amp;#8220;bus full of prostitutes&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; if they beat AC Milan or Juventus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old, who owned&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1302934/ac-milan/"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;between 1986 and 2017,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7371758/ac-milan-silvio-berlusconi-serie-c-monza/"&gt;bought the team in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AN INFLUENCER says she is so stunning that people believe she is a plastic sex doll &amp;#8211; forcing her to dig out childhood pics to prove she is human. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/colombia/"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; beauty Carolina Gomez has been bombarded with comments questioning how she looks so flawless in snaps. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949509" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-carolina-gomez-girlfriend-807794892.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949509" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Carolina Gomez has been dubbed a plastic sex doll due to her flawless features[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949473" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 779px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-yeferson-cossio-well-807795113.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=769" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949473" width="769" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She caused a stir on social media after debuting her relationship with Yeferson Cossio[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949490" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-carolina-gomez-girlfriend-807795168.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949490" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The model shared a childhood snap to prove she was 100 per cent natural[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;A host of her 692,000 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; followers were convinced that she must have been made in a factory to have such a striking appearance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/models/"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; has recently caused a stir online after announcing her relationship with fellow Colombian &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; star Yeferson Cossio. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news of the romance sent her follower count soaring, as her beau&amp;#8217;s 10 million strong fanbase were eager to check her out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple enjoyed a trip exploring &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks and shared a series of loved-up snaps online. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But social media users were left stunned by Carolina&amp;#8217;s good looks, leaving them believing that the brunette was a plastic &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/sex/"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; doll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the picture, she is seen cuddling up to Yeferson on a yacht while sporting a stunning red bikini. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Followers pointed out her rigid pose, unblemished skin and perfect features simply looked too good to be true. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Carolina hit back at critics by whipping out some childhood snaps to prove that, apart from a boob job, she is 100 per cent natural. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She shared a sweet image of herself as a youngster with curly brown hair and pouting, claiming she has always had plump lips.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The influencer also squashed rumours she has had a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plastic-surgery/"&gt;nose job&lt;/a&gt;, insisting the snap corroborated her story. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolina wrote: &amp;#8220;Apparently I have dyed my hair and injected my lips, and as you can see from the photographs I must&amp;#8217;ve been doing that since I was a baby.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s anything wrong with women who do this, we are all beautiful in our own way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But for my part, the only thing I altered was my breasts. I don&amp;#8217;t plan to do anything else.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her new man wasn&amp;#8217;t too pleased with trolls targeting the beauty either, seeing him also take to Instagram to further show off his gorgeous girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeferson posted more pics of the pair alongside the caption: &amp;#8220;Every man needs a doll&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He even reportedly set up a prank video in which he went into a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/disney/"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; store to &amp;#8220;buy&amp;#8221; Carolina before taking her to a restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clip is said to show the model collapsing in fits of laughter as she was unable to keep the joke going any longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carolina revealed that since she started dating Yeferson, he and his team have been helping her build her own platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She told her followers he &amp;#8220;treats her like a princess every day&amp;#8221; and is &amp;#8220;so cute&amp;#8221; with her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949476" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-carolina-gomez-girlfriend-807795025.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949476" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The influencer explained she has only had a boob job and doesn&amp;#8217;t plan on undergoing any other procedures[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949503" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo-shows-carolina-gomez-girlfriend-807795108.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949503" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Carolina&amp;#8217;s boyfriend has also blasted critics who trolled her[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DISGRACED influencer Andrew Tate believes he will be shot when he&amp;#8217;s released from jail in his latest bizarre rant while under house arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/andrew-tate/"&gt;Tate&lt;/a&gt; took to Twitter to&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21905806/andrew-tate-jail-release-video/"&gt; share a clip of him pacing up and down a room shirtless&lt;/a&gt;, the former kickboxer looked dishevelled and worn out, with ungroomed hair and a misshapen beard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And days later, the misogynist claimed he believes he would be &amp;#8220;shot&amp;#8221; as other &amp;#8220;silencing attempts had failed&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He posted on Twitter: “I prepare my body to absorb the brutal kinetics of piercing lead. As all other silencing attempts fail, and stage 3 approaches &amp;#8211; I anticipate a bullet will be the chosen utensil of pacification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can only pray and prepare I will force myself to breathe the best I can I promise.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A COUPLE who fetched their dog from the groomers made it home with their newly trimmed pooch only to realise they made a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The animal lovers filmed the hilarious moment on social media, which left other &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dogs/"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; owners stunned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949088" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 551px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tik1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=541" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949088" width="541" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The woman filmed the moment she realised she&amp;#8217;d fetched the wrong dog[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949112" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 566px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tik3.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=556" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949112" width="556" height="712" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She said poodle breeds usually come back from the groomer looking smaller[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The woman explained the dog she originally picked up looked identical to their poodle breed but there was something just a bit off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikToker&lt;/a&gt; @Lexicircle was seen comforting their &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; puppy as they headed back to the groomer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;We are bringing Tater back to the groomer to pick up the real Tater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is definitely not our dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I thought it was but Adam knew it was not.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman claimed dogs from particular poodle breeds looked very similar but the first tell-tale sign was the animal didn&amp;#8217;t recognise the owners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;Sometimes when they give poodle breeds grooming they do get a lot smaller so I didn&amp;#8217;t think that was weird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then when we brought her inside she was jumping all over Ryan, which is not usual and she was kind of ignoring Adam, which was very weird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And the dog was exploring the house like she had never seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But the defining characteristic of Tater is that she never lost her baby teeth &amp;#8211; and this dog won&amp;#8217;t let me look at its teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Tater we are coming for you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vision then cuts to a scene of the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; Tater waiting anxiously in its cage at the groomers, letting out a bark to mark the embarrassing moment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tater is then seen happily reunited with her owners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video has more than five million views with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; users sharing their thoughts on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Aww, I can&amp;#8217;t imagine how Tater was feeling when y&amp;#8217;all walking out of the groomer shop with another dog,&amp;#8221; a TikTok user said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I cannot decide if this is funny or sad&amp;#8230; it is a rollercoaster of emotions,&amp;#8221; one added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Tater barked at you like &amp;#8216;how dare you&amp;#8217;,&amp;#8221; a second remarked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As a groomer I have heard of these things happening more often than it should,&amp;#8221; another claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some animal lovers, however, were more bemused with the lady&amp;#8217;s mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ok just checking the comments to make sure everyone agrees those dogs look nothing alike,&amp;#8221; a woman said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t imagine ever not recognising my dog,&amp;#8221; one commented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;OMG that is hilarious but even I can tell the difference,&amp;#8221; another noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949107" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 552px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tik2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=542" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949107" width="542" height="703" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; Tater sits in a cage waiting for her owners to return[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21949115" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 563px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tik4.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=553" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21949115" width="553" height="848" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Tater, who looked similar to the original dog, appeared happy to be home[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER top energy boss in Russia has been found dead – the 40th mystery death of an oligarch in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The body of&amp;nbsp;Igor&amp;nbsp;Shkurko, 49, deputy general director of  Yakutskenergo was discovered in his cell in a detention centre after he was accused of taking a bribe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21947885" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 792px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Igor-Shkurko-1-East2west-News.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=782" alt="Igor Shkurko, 49,  deputy general director of Russian energy company Yakutskenergo was found dead in a pretrial detention centre on April 4, 2023, in Yakutsk." class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21947885" width="782" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Igor Shkurko was found dead in a pretrial detention centre in Yakutsk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="5229" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TOB-RUSSIAN-DEATH-GRID-GRAPHIC-V4-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=294" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21950024" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The day&amp;nbsp;before his death, the executive&amp;nbsp;had submitted appeals against what he claimed was an unjust bribery allegation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spate of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21658269/putin-killing-russian-elite-mob-boss/"&gt;unexplained&amp;nbsp;deaths&lt;/a&gt; have occurred since the start of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin’s &lt;/a&gt;war in Ukraine more than 13 months ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the deaths of at least 39 previous deaths high profile figures &amp;#8211; ranging from oligarchs to scientists and even generals &amp;#8211; could show the shadowy and bloodstained hand of the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; authorities have provided no details on how&amp;nbsp;Shkurko&amp;nbsp;died but have said the evidence points to there being no signs of a “criminal death”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His company issued a statement saying: “We will remember him as an open, hospitable person with a big heart and a good sense of humour, the caring head of a close-knit family.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The high-earning Shkurko &amp;#8211; who was married with two sons &amp;#8211; was accused of demanding a £5,000 bribe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cloak of secrecy appears to have been thrown over the circumstances of his death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shkurko was a member of the pro-Putin United Russia political party but his membership was suspended following the bribery allegation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Russian Federal Penitentiary Service said in a statement: “On April 4, the accused was found in a cell of the pre-trial detention centre with no signs of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Arriving medical workers ascertained his death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An investigative team was called to the scene. According to preliminary data, no signs of a criminal death were found.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shkurko was in charge of the technical management side of Yakutskenergo, which supplies power to the world’s coldest region, Yakutia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dozens of high profile figures have died since&amp;nbsp;Putin&amp;nbsp;launched his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;bloody Ukraine war&lt;/a&gt; in over a year ago &amp;#8211; with many in odd circumstances, such as sudden &amp;#8220;suicides&amp;#8221; and falls from windows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7580741/mystery-as-russias-scarface-oligarch-dies/"&gt;Sergey Grishin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; the so-called &amp;#8220;Scarface&amp;#8221; oligarch who sold Meghan and Harry their California mansion &amp;#8211; died from sepsis after criticising Putin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And meanwhile scientist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7540406/russia-covid-vaccine-sputnik-creator-dead-murder/"&gt;Andrey Botikov&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; who created the &amp;#8220;Sputnik V&amp;#8221; vaccine &amp;#8211; was strangled with a belt in his apartment last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both men were two of the latest to join the staggering body count of high profile deaths of people linked to Mad Vlad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jon Sweet, a retired US Army Military Intelligence Officer, and Mark Toth, a national security analyst, described Putin as running &amp;#8220;modern-day FSB version of Murder Inc.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Murder Inc. was an organised crime group that operated in the US &amp;#8211; and is believed to have been responsible for more than 1,000 contact killings in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Anyone seen as a potential threat seems to have an attraction to an open window,&amp;#8221; Sweet told The Sun Online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	



&lt;p&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s regime of course has never admitted to anything &amp;#8211; and has always dealt with the deaths of their enemies with a wry smile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Novaya Gazeta Europe, a leading investigative news outlet&amp;nbsp;and Transparency International Russia, recently conducted an investigation into a series of deaths at energy giant Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They linked them to a “money-laundering scheme” benefiting a top gas executive’s family and his cronies from Putin’s security services and military.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among suspicous energy industry deaths was that of&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18351972/clues-putin-allies-murdered-purge/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Alexander Tyulyakov&lt;/a&gt;, deputy head of corporate security at Gazprom who allegedly committed suicide the day after war was declared.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He died&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in Gazprom&amp;#8217;s guarded Leninsky corporate village in Leningrad region, near St Petersburg, and his body was reportedly discovered by his lover.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A WOMAN shared a hilariously rude note given to her by a neighbour after she used her &amp;#8220;toxic&amp;#8221; wood-burning fireplace at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unnamed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/melbourne/"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; resident took to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; after she discovered her habit for staying toasty had caused an uproar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946857" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 495px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ffa14090-93cc-4ba3-92d7-f92d79d8a251.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=485" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946857" width="485" height="730" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The aggressive letter the woman received from her neighbour&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feeling the chill of autumn, the mystery woman had lit a fire not suspecting that it would cause a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/neighbours-2/"&gt;neighbourly&lt;/a&gt; feud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, she sound found a note stuck to her door that began with: &amp;#8220;Dear Neighbour, have you thought about moving to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/queensland/"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was handwritten and just the beginning of a furious rant clearly written by someone ready to explode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The author claimed the fire-lighting woman had seriously upset a family down the road with her &amp;#8220;selfishness&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;ignorance&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The letter read: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s obvious it&amp;#8217;s not warm enough here for you that you have that stinking polluting wood fire burning all the time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All the houses down wind have to choke and splutter on the toxic smoke you pump out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family claimed they spent the whole weekend inside with all the doors and windows closed to escape the &amp;#8220;toxic&amp;#8221; chimney smoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The letter continued: &amp;#8220;Word of warning&amp;#8230; next time you b***h and moan of another person&amp;#8217;s selfishness infringing on your democracy, just spare a thought that your ignorance and woodfire has infringed on ours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not happy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20068652/vile-neighbour-letter-garden-worst-estate/"&gt;Passive aggressive letters&lt;/a&gt; sent by neighbours have trended online and sparked heated debates on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One mum shared a shocking note she received from a furious resident about her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21861324/neighbour-angry-note-children-quiet/"&gt;children being too &amp;#8220;noisy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another tenant was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932182/lived-below-neighbours-dead-body-two-years/"&gt;absolutely horrified to discover &lt;/a&gt;she had been living underneath her dead neighbour&amp;#8217;s body for two years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DEFIANT Donald Trump raged America &amp;#8220;is going to hell&amp;#8221; as he riled up his die-hard supporters following his court appearance in New York. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old &amp;#8211; frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024 &amp;#8211; has been formally &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939837/donald-trump-arrested-indictment-mugshot-live-updates/"&gt;arrested and charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946646" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-west-palm-beach-florida-807864474.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946646" width="960" height="682" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Donald Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case in a defiant speech[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946933" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/000-donald-trumps-legal-fees-807876615.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946933" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trump is accused over alleged hush payments to porn star Stormy Daniels[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946948" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-supporters-president-donald-j-807922402.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946948" width="960" height="639" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Alamy&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trump supporters gather outside his Mar-a-Lago resort for his speech[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The former US president is accused over alleged hush payments to porn star &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/stormy-daniels/"&gt;Stormy Daniels&lt;/a&gt; and former Playboy playmate &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5378738/karen-mcdougal-donald-trump-playboy-model-affair-claims/"&gt;Karen McDougal&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pleaded not guilty to all 34 charges during a historic hearing in a  Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday &amp;#8211; which lasted just under an hour. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old then jetted home to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/florida/"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17901721/trump-announces-trump-force-one-jet-emergency-landing/"&gt;Trump Force One&lt;/a&gt; for a choreographed rally-style appearance at his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13602889/mar-a-lago-location-president-trump-florida-estate/"&gt;Mar-a-Lago&lt;/a&gt; resort in front of a crowd of cheering fans and family. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking out to &amp;#8220;God Bless the USA&amp;#8221; at the start of the 25-minute speech, Trump lashed out at the judge presiding over his case &amp;#8211; calling him &amp;#8220;the real criminal&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He accused Juan Merchan of being a &amp;#8220;Trump hating judge with a Trump hating wife and family&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and said the case against him was &amp;#8220;an insult to our country&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The only crime I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump called for the &amp;#8220;ridiculous&amp;#8221; case to be &amp;#8220;dropped immediately&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he suggested he lost the 2020 US election unfairly &amp;#8220;because our country is going to hell&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The remarks pivoted to Trump&amp;#8217;s son Barron at one point as the proud dad said: &amp;#8220;Barron will be great someday. He is tall and he&amp;#8217;s smart.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporters wore “Make America Great Again” and “Trump 2024” caps as he spoke in the plush ballroom at the Mar-a-Lago estate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump denies the claim by 44-year-old Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex once in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/"&gt;Melania&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/"&gt;former lawyer Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt; allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argue this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he cannot allow &amp;#8220;businesses to cover up criminal conduct&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The historic case marks the first time a former president has been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The indictment focused on Trump&amp;#8217;s reimbursement checks to Cohen &amp;#8211; with details of the other charges mostly kept under wraps. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a separate filing by prosecutors detailed similar schemes Trump allegedly orchestrated to silence two other people who said they had damaging information about him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wearing his trademark red tie and dark blue suit, Trump arrived at the court building on Tuesday flanked by a secret service and police motorcade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police estimated there were 300 Trump supporters near the court, with about 150 demonstrating against him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21947184" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-west-palm-beach-florida-807868909.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21947184" width="960" height="565" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trump supporters waved banners declaring &amp;#8216;Trump or Death&amp;#8217; and wrapped themselves in American flags[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;There were scuffles before police separated the groups in a park behind barricades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anti-Trump protesters rolled out a sign saying: “Trump lies all the time.” Another said: “Lock him up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump supporters, meanwhile, waved banners declaring “Trump or Death” and wrapped themselves in American flags.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Merchan banned TV cameras from the court after Trump’s lawyers argued it would create a “circus-like atmosphere”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the hearing, after a clerk read out the indictment number, 71543, the former president stayed seated and, in a throaty voice, declared: “Not guilty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier, he appeared calm and mostly stared ahead as he and his legal team entered the 15th-floor room of the Manhattan Criminal Courts building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known as Part 59, it is the same court where film mogul &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harvey-weinstein/"&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; was put on trial for rape and sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the hearing, Trump was fingerprinted and processed inside the courthouse — but he didn’t have his mugshot taken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hearing was then slightly delayed as his legal team reviewed the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 24 court security officers and police plus four Secret Service agents stood guard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Five sketch artists sat in the jury box, furiously trying to capture the unprecedented scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the former president entered the courtroom, he briefly looked at a huddle of news cameras &amp;#8211; but did not stop to speak to reporters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside the court, Trump sat with his hands in his lap and his lawyers at his side, staring straight ahead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the hearing, Trump&amp;#8217;s lawyer Todd Blanche said Trump is &amp;#8220;absolutely frustrated, upset and believes that there is a great injustice happening in the courtroom&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#8217;s legal team plan file a motion to dismiss the case against him, one of his lawyers added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His next hearing is due to be held on December 4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If found guilty he could face jail, although that is thought to be unlikely.&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-trump-indictment-live-news-updates-12840161%3Fpostid%3D5734616%23liveblog-body&amp;amp;t=Trump%20is%20%27walking%20a%20tightrope%27%20and%20his%20lawyers%20will%20use%20%27every%20delay%20tactic%20they%20can%27%2C%20says%20former%20ambassador" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump%20is%20%27walking%20a%20tightrope%27%20and%20his%20lawyers%20will%20use%20%27every%20delay%20tactic%20they%20can%27%2C%20says%20former%20ambassador&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-trump-indictment-live-news-updates-12840161%3Fpostid%3D5734616%23liveblog-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:?to=&amp;amp;subject=Trump%20is%20%27walking%20a%20tightrope%27%20and%20his%20lawyers%20will%20use%20%27every%20delay%20tactic%20they%20can%27%2C%20says%20former%20ambassador&amp;amp;body=Trump%20is%20%27walking%20a%20tightrope%27%20and%20his%20lawyers%20will%20use%20%27every%20delay%20tactic%20they%20can%27%2C%20says%20former%20ambassador%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-trump-indictment-live-news-updates-12840161%3Fpostid%3D5734616%23liveblog-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-indictment-live-news-updates-12840161?postid=5734616#liveblog-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A DOLL-obsessed loner has been jailed for the kidnapping of Cleo Smith, as chilling new details emerge about the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meth addict Terence Kelly, 37,&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16477856/what-happened-missing-cleo-smith/"&gt; snatched the four-year-old from a tent &lt;/a&gt;where she was sleeping with her parents and admitted to cops he “roughed her up” while he kept her captive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946695" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 796px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cleo-smith-4-went-missing-691025518.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=786" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946695" width="786" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Cleo Smith was abducted from a campsite in Australia[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946724" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 580px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2021-carnarvon-australia-kelly-36-691536376.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=570" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946724" width="570" height="636" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Terence Kelly has now been jailed for 13 years[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946730" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-accused-kidnapping-cleo-smith-691350443.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946730" width="960" height="561" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;After his arrest, it emerged that Kelly was obsessed with dolls&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly has now been sentenced for 13 years at court in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to stealing a child, in a case that captivated the world’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told police he had tried tie little Cleo to a chair but she fought back during her 18 day ordeal, which ended when &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16617893/amazing-moment-cleo-smith-safe-vanishing/"&gt;police burst into his home.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I just used sticky tape, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t working. So, I thought, &amp;#8216;I won&amp;#8217;t tie her up any more with the sticky tape&amp;#8217;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I tried to tie her to the chair and that with her hands, feet and mouth. I tried to do that. She was a bit of a fighter.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly also told cops he “roughed her up a few times” when she became “bossy” by asking for chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His motivation for snatching Cleo was that he wanted a little girl he could dress up and play with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I, you know, wanted to hold on to her. I wasn&amp;#8217;t planning to keep her forever,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passing sentence at a court in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/western-australia/"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Julie Wager&amp;nbsp;heard during her captivity, terrified Cleo spent most days alone, trapped in a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly altered the door handle so the room locked from the outside and put on the radio to drown out any noise she made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The young victim heard her name on the radio and she said they were saying her name,” said the judge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cleo and her family’s ordeal began when Kelly unzipped Cleo&amp;#8217;s family tent and discovered her sleeping inside, alongside her baby sister and parents, on October 16, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He quietly bundled her into front seat of his car and drove the 47 mile journey back to his house in the town of Carnarvon, taking dirt tracks to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While holding Cleo captive, unemployed Kelly went about his usual routine and was spotted out in the community several times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He attended compulsory face-to-face meetings about searching for work, seeing relatives, and giving them lifts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All the while, an intensive search for Cleo was underway involving land and air crews, roadblocks and CCTV footage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually cops were able to identify Kelly as a suspect using mobile phone signals and thanks to a tip-off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police cameras show the moment Cleo was carried in an officer’s arms to safety after cops burst into his home just before 1am.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After little Cleo paused for a second, she told police words they had desperately wanted to hear throughout their hunt for her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“M-my name is Cleo,” she replies as one of the clearly relieved cops says “hello Cleo!” and another says “you’re alright bubby”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After he was arrested &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16631114/cleo-smith-kidnapper-obsessed-bratz-dolls/"&gt;Kelly’s obsession&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16631114/cleo-smith-suspect-obsessed-bratz-dolls/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;with Bratz dolls, an American brand featuring scantily clad teenage figures, emerged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures show dozens of them in his house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One showed a room dedicated to the dolls, with shelves stacked to the ceiling showing a large number still in their boxes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his Facebook page he posted a video of himself with a filter showing hearts with the words “I love my dolls”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist consulted in the case said Kelly suffered from a severe personality disorder arising from childhood neglect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That led him to create a &amp;#8220;fantasy world&amp;#8221; with the existence of multiple imaginary children by different women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Wager noted Kelly&amp;#8217;s own troubled upbringing, but said his risk of re-offending was high according to the advice of psychiatric experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You pose a high risk of seriously psychologically harming any future victim in the event that you did re-offend,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly will be eligible for parole in 11 years and six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946700" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 740px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2021-carnarvon-western-australia-police-691178651.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=730" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946700" width="730" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Cleo was held for 18 days by Kelly before police freed her[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21946718" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-accused-kidnapping-cleo-smith-691350666.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946718" width="960" height="899" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;INSTAGRAM&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A room in Kelly&amp;#8217;s house was dedicated to his doll collection[/caption]

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RUSSIAN dissidents are understood to have claimed responsibility for the bombing that killed a Russian propogandist and have warned more is to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The underground anti-establishment group, known as the National Republic Army (NRA), have allegedly claimed to be behind &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;the attack on pro-Kremlin blogger Vladlen Tatarsky.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21946019" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darya-trepova-suspected-killing-russian-807790981.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21946019" width="960" height="612" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trepova, 26, appeared in court on Tuesday charged with terrorism only hours before dissident Russians allegedly claimed their involvement[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a aria-label="a statement (opens in a new tab)" href="https://t.me/s/rospartizan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt; published on the Russian social media app Telegram, the group claim to have organised and carried out the bombing attack that tore through a café in central St Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also praise the alleged assassin, Daria Trepova, 26, who they call a &amp;#8220;hero&amp;#8221; for her role in the fight to overthrow Putin and call on others to follow her &amp;#8220;example&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bile-monger Tatarsky was holding a media event for 100 people on Sunday when a woman, assumed to be Trepova, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21925611/putin-blogger-signed-own-death-warrant-blown-up-statue/"&gt;handed him a gold TNT-laden figurine of himself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chilling footage captures &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932672/russian-blogger-killed-video-st-petersburg/"&gt;the exact moment the Putin-ally meets his end&lt;/a&gt; when the concealed bomb explodes killing him instantly and injuring 30 others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The female suspect, Trepova, was quickly caught and later pictured aggressively being interrogated by Russians on Monday while &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21931448/assassin-bombed-putin-blogger-interrogated-radiator/"&gt;chained to a radiator after a strange alleged confession.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, she was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21942121/statue-assassin-glass-cage-putin-blogger/"&gt;paraded in a glass cage in court&lt;/a&gt; after being charged with terrorism. The 26-year-old could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the NRA have now reportedly declared their involvement &amp;#8220;in the liquidation of Vladen Tatarsky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shadowy group is considered one of the most violent of those trying to overthrow mad Vlad &amp;#8211; but also the most mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their manifesto is to destroy the tyrant and free Russia from his grasp. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It contains the definitive line: &amp;#8220;Putin will be deposed and destroyed by us!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the group rose to prominence through a serious of arson attacks and sabotage missions led against the Russian military from inside their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NRA previously claimed to be behind the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19576148/putins-inner-circle-fear-coup-rogue-agents-resistance-fighters/"&gt;violent assassination&lt;/a&gt; of Darya Dugin &amp;#8211; Russian journalist and daughter of Putin&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;spiritual mastermind&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18109464/putin-rasputin-inspired-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexander Dugin&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; in August of last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their alleged new statement reads: &amp;#8220;We, the St. Petersburg column of the National Republican Army, declare:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We organized and carried out an action on April 2, 2023 against a group of Z-activists and personally against the well-known warmonger and war propagandist, war criminal Maxim Fomin, known as Vladlen Tatarsky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group claim they received no outside foreign help and acted &amp;#8220;autonomously&amp;#8221;, which goes against the shaky claims made by Russian media outlets that &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the bombing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson for the group and well-known Russian exile, Ilya Ponomarev, also confirmed the NRA&amp;#8217;s claims they masterminded the operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The partisans are resisting the current political system in&amp;nbsp;Russia&amp;nbsp;and want it to be removed&amp;#8221;, he told &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1754894/putin-propagandist-bomb-kremlin-warning"&gt;the Express.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They cannot join the fighting in the military, but they are holding the front inside&amp;nbsp;Russia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ponomarev claims the partisans wanted to make Putin-backing Kremlin elites aware that they are &amp;#8220;not safe anymore&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The audience is the elites: &amp;#8216;Beware, you are not safe anymore, Putin is not able to protect you, we are everywhere&amp;#8217;,&amp;#8221; he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group&amp;#8217;s supposed statement continues with: &amp;#8220;This action was carried out in a club owned by one of the most famous Russian gangsters and criminals, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As a result of the action the club will stop its work.&amp;nbsp;We are satisfied with this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The action we carried out was not directed against civilians, and all the victims are among the active supporters of the war, justifying the war crimes of the Putin regime in Ukraine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement then refers to Trepova as a &amp;#8220;well-known figure in the leftist and feminist movement&amp;#8221; and a &amp;#8220;hero&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At a time when many &amp;#8216;oppositionists&amp;#8217; wrote posts on Facebook and shone flashlights, she fought, went to protests and risked her freedom by participating in all opposition movements that now refuse her.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Russian partisan group calls on human rights groups to help the suspect who they see as a &amp;#8220;hostage of the system&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We call on the people of Russia to follow our example and provide all kinds of resistance to the criminal Russian regime up to its complete destruction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Criminals will not feel safe on Russian soil!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement signs off with: &amp;#8220;Russia will be free!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Trepova will remain in Russian custody till June 2 while the trial is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &amp;#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova&amp;#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has previously been claimed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/"&gt;Putin personally ordered Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s assassination&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and will use it to crush his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telegram channel General SVR&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &amp;#8211; claimed the Russian tyrant was &amp;#8220;pleased&amp;#8221; with the killing of Tatarsky, and the successful hit will supposedly be used to fuel a new wave of attacks on his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GRIM-faced Donald Trump&amp;nbsp;sat silently in court yesterday — as the first former or sitting US President to be criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old — frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024 — was formally &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939837/donald-trump-arrested-indictment-mugshot-live-updates/"&gt;arrested and charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945221" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-trump-set-807822052.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945221" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Grim-faced Donald Trump sat silently in court yesterday — as the first former US President to be criminally charged[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945285" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 440px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/33be0ff2-82d6-45df-adc9-fd2b8e11ea32.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=430" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945285" width="430" height="434" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trump is accused over alleged hush payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, above, and former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal in 2016&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Refer to caption&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945292" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/be4b446b-0ea5-4976-9466-bf91022a9dc3.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945292" width="960" height="701" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trump was wearing his trademark red tie and dark blue suit for the historic court hearing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a clerk read out the indictment number, 71543, at the New York hearing, the former President stayed seated and, in a throaty voice, declared: “&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/21943522/donald-trump-surrenders-stormy-daniels-indictment/"&gt;Not guilty&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is accused over alleged hush payments to porn star&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/stormy-daniels/"&gt; Stormy Daniels&lt;/a&gt; and former Playboy playmate &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5378738/karen-mcdougal-donald-trump-playboy-model-affair-claims/"&gt;Karen McDougal&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier, he appeared calm and mostly stared ahead as he and his legal team entered the 15th-floor room of the Manhattan Criminal Courts building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known as Part 59, it is the same court where film mogu&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harvey-weinstein/"&gt;l Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; was put on trial for rape and sexual assault.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the hearing, Trump was fingerprinted and processed inside the courthouse — but he didn’t have his mugshot taken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hearing was then slightly delayed as his legal team reviewed the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Journalists allowed on the 15th floor were subjected to a bag search. Two dozen police stood guard along the corridor, where the bathrooms had been closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 24 court security officers and police plus four Secret Service agents stood guard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Five sketch artists sat in the jury box, furiously trying to capture the unprecedented scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg entered the court shortly before Trump and took a seat at the front right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As tension mounted and the temperature rose — the air conditioning was not on and the blinds were shut — Trump entered at 2.29pm, 14 minutes late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was wearing his trademark red tie and dark blue suit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He walked slowly towards the front, staring straight ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ex-President stood with his arms by his sides before being shown to a seat to the left where he sat next to his attorneys, Susan Necheles and Todd Blanche.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Juan Merchan ordered both sides to calm down after prosecutors complained about Trump’s recent social media posts, including one of him holding a baseball bat against the head of the top prosecutor in the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge said he was not issuing a gagging order, as had been suggested, as Trump was a “candidate for President of the United States” and his “First Amendment rights are critically important”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the hearing, which lasted just under an hour, Trump took a private jet to his Florida home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was due to address his supporters from there late last night. Trump denies the claim by 44-year-old Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, that they had sex once in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The alleged affair came a year after he had married wife &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/"&gt;Melania&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also denies wrongdoing related to the £104,000 ($130,000) payment his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-cohen/"&gt;former lawyer Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt; allegedly gave Daniels to keep quiet about the tryst before the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the historic hearing, Trump lashed out at Mr Bragg and claimed the DA had been influenced in bringing the charges by his wife, Jamila.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “He will go down in Judicial history, and his Trump Hating wife will be, I’m sure, very proud of him!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump last Thursday but the charges had remained under seal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about President Joe Biden’s reaction to Trump’s arraignment and said: “This is not his focus today.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Trump critic Rep Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, tweeted: “A sombre moment in the life of our country, when it is necessary to arraign a former president on criminal charges. As the case falls to the District Attorney to prove, we must recognise what is most important: Even the most powerful are held to account, and that nobody is above the law.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day the former President was seen leaving his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5294732/trump-tower-built-designer-donald-trump/"&gt;Trump Tower&lt;/a&gt; residence in the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he wrote: “Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seems so surreal — Wow, they are going to arrest me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump arrived at the court building in Manhattan flanked by a secret service and police motorcade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police estimated there were 300 Trump supporters near the court, with about 150 demonstrating against him. There were scuffles before police separated the groups in a park behind barricades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anti-Trump protesters rolled out a sign saying: “Trump lies all the time.” Another said: “Lock him up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump supporters, meanwhile, waved banners declaring “Trump or Death” and wrapped themselves in American flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21945244" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-former-president-807783942.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945244" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Supporters of the ex-President make there thoughts clear with placards and T-shirts[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945245" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-new-york-city-former-807791724.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945245" width="960" height="626" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A Trump supporter, left, clashes with a rival at the court[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Pro-Trump politician &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/marjorie-taylor-greene/"&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt; walked through the crowd and made bizarre claims comparing him to Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “President Trump is joining some of the most incredible people in history in being arrested today. Nelson Mandela was arrested, served time in prison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jesus was arrested and murdered by the Roman government.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Journalists began lining up outside the court at 2pm on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judge Merchan banned TV cameras from the court after Trump’s lawyers argued it would create a “circus-like atmosphere”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reporters were banned from using phones and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trump is now due to reappear in court in December. If found guilty he could face jail, although that is thought to be unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s 34 charges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DONALD Trump denied 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree and conspiracy over his alleged role in giving cash to an adult film star to hush up an affair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been investigating a $130,000 (£105,000) payment to Stormy Daniels by ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump acknowledged reimbursing him, and this is not illegal, but the record of the payment claimed it was for legal fees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say this amounts to falsifying business records, with each cheque Trump wrote counted as separate charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JOE Biden&amp;#8217;s wife Jill will attend the King&amp;#8217;s coronation on behalf of the US President.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/"&gt;Mr Biden&lt;/a&gt; said on Monday &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21904495/president-joe-biden-will-not-attend-king-charles-coronation/"&gt;he would be unable to attend&lt;/a&gt; the May 6 event because of his schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945534" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 856px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/404ca2f4-1247-4f42-b093-5817e02bdd57.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=846" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945534" width="846" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s wife Jill will attend the King&amp;#8217;s coronation on behalf of the US President&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945506" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-berlin-germany-king-queen-807801832.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945506" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The White House said the President told the King First Lady Jill would attend on behalf of the US.[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;But in a statement, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/the-white-house/"&gt;The White House&lt;/a&gt; said the President told The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/king-charles/"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; in a phone call on April 4 that First Lady Jill would attend on behalf of the US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement said: &amp;#8220;President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with King Charles III, underscoring the strength of the relationship between our countries and the friendship between our peoples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The President congratulated the King on his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/king-charles-iiis-coronation/"&gt;upcoming coronation&lt;/a&gt; and informed him that First Lady Jill Biden looks forward to attending on behalf of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The President also conveyed his desire to meet with the King in the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/united-kingdom/"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; at a future date.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The First Lady will be among a raft of world leaders and dignitaries descending on London for Charles&amp;#8217; crowning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21122982/plans-king-charles-coronation-revealed/"&gt;Events for the coronation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will start on Saturday May 6 and continue over Sunday May 7 and Monday May 8, which has been&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19758534/bank-holiday-king-charles-coronation/"&gt;declared a bank holiday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The action packed weekend will see King Charles and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21943773/buckingham-camilla-consort-title-king-charles-coronation-invite/"&gt;newly titled Queen Camilla&lt;/a&gt; arrive at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19813381/who-built-westminster-abbey/"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in The King’s Procession on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by the coronation service conducted by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5559170/archbishop-of-canterbury-justin-welby/"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The service will “reflect the monarch’s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the service, the newly-crowned King and Queen will return to the Palace in a larger ceremonial parade known as the Coronation Procession.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is expected to include ­thousands of troops, military bands and other members of the Royal Family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the procession the Royal Family are expected to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has already been suggested that family members appearing on the balcony will be limited to working royals as part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/king-charles/"&gt;King&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;slimmed down&amp;#8221; new-look monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A blockbuster concert ­featuring global pop icons, who may include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/sir-paul-mccartney/"&gt;Sir Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/20536599/queen-band-members-freddie-mercury/"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, is also planned at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/windsor-castle/"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people all over the UK will be encouraged to stage street parties in another stunning show of pageantry to the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iconic locations around the UK will be illuminated with projections, lasers and drone displays as the “centrepiece” of celebrations to mark His Majesty’s crowning in a very modern way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Royal experts predicted the event will “dwarf” even last year’s ­spectacular celebrations for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/queen-platinum-jubilee/"&gt;Queen’s Platinum Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AMID the bloodbath of Bakhmut, Russian war-lord Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenaries have a powerful incentive to run towards the “meat grinder” front line.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they don’t, the sinister boss of the Wagner Group likes to see those who displease him bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21944672" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2011-kremlin-connected-businessman-yevgeny-774311820.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944672" width="960" height="804" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin calls Vladimir Putin &amp;#8216;Papa&amp;#8217; and recruits vile prisoners to join his army[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21944714" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 751px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-businessman-yevgeny-prigozhin-attends-773724499.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=741" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944714" width="741" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Prigozhin formed private army Wagner to give the Russian president &amp;#8216;plausible deniability&amp;#8217; over its sordid activities[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;When an alleged defector from his rag-tag convict army was murdered using the gruesome method, Prigozhin gloated that it was “a dog’s death for a dog”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It helps to explain how a former hot dog salesman — who “never refused to do dirty deeds” — has risen from jailbird to be one of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin’s &lt;/a&gt;most powerful &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/"&gt;lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oafish &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, who, like a mafia henchman, calls Putin “Papa”, formed private army Wagner to give the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; president “plausible deniability” over its sordid activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/syria/"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and some of Africa’s most brutal conflicts, Wagner has fought dirty wars, allowing Russia to deflect blame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A British mercenary told of an incident off Africa’s east coast: “The Wagner guys had caught some pirates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Two grenades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They tied them up, put them back in their boat, poured petrol over them and lit them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’d said some-thing they wouldn’t have thought there was anything strange — ‘That’s what we do to pirates’.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now billionaire Prigozhin’s private army could be instrumental in deciding Ukraine’s fate. Recruiting from the dregs of Russian jails, he tells murderers, rapists and robbers: “I need your criminal talents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He promises that if they sur-vive six months on the front line — a tall order amid Russia’s chaotic battle plans — their con-victions will be quashed and they can go home as free men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one video, 61-year-old Prigozhin is heard telling convicts: “Do you have anyone else who can get you out of this jail, if you’ve got ten years to spend behind bars?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“God and Allah can, but in a wooden box. I can get you out of here alive. But I don’t always bring you back alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those on the front line would be given two grenades — to blow themselves up if surrounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin said: “No one is retreating. No one backs down. No one is being taken prisoner.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deserters, he told the lags, “will be shot”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others are terrified they will get the sledgehammer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One recruit — enamoured by the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt; leader’s brutal manner — said: “He’s one of us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Prigozhin is a violent convicted criminal himself. Born in Leningrad — now &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; — in the Soviet Union in 1961, he was raised by his single mother, who worked at a local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of a career as a professional cross-country skier, he graduated from a prestigious athletics boarding school in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A life in sport eluded him — so instead he turned to crime.&lt;br&gt;In 1979, aged just 18, he got a suspended two-and-a-half-year sentence for theft. Instead of jail he worked in a chemical factory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years later Prigozhin and accomplices went on a robbing spree, during which they mugged a female victim at knifepoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin grabbed the woman from behind and choked her until she lost consciousness. He was jailed for 13 years, nine of which were in a high-security prison camp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year a video emerged claiming he had performed sex acts on other prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21944737" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 710px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/www-reddit-com-r-russiaukrainewar2022-797322304.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=700" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944737" width="700" height="875" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Telegram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Prigozhin greets Akhmat special forces commander Apti Alaudinov and gives him a sledgehammer[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945485" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 10px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" width="3000" height="1684" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-shows-yevgeny-prigozhin-chief-799996033.jpg?strip=all" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945485" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Prigozhin this week claimed Wagner will soon take Bakhmut[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;A tattooed man claiming to be a crime boss said of Prigozhin: “He knew his place and he agreed to his place.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pro-Kremlin bloggers say the claims were a smear by Ukraine, while analysts believe his many political enemies inside Russia may be behind the suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was freed from prison in 1990, and the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17791194/which-countries-soviet-union/"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; collapsed the following year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin opened a hot dog stand — which soon flourished amid the chaos as Russia switched to a capitalist economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon he was running a chain of convenience stores, then several top-end restaurants in St Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The jewel in his culinary crown was a floating restaurant called New Island, which sailed up and down the Neva River. When Japanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/13945911/tokyo-olympics-yoshiro-mori-sexism-row/"&gt;Yoshiro Mori&lt;/a&gt; visited Putin in April 2000, the pair dined on board the New Island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin recalled that Putin “saw how I built a business out of a kiosk” and “saw that I had no problem serving plates to dignitaries in person”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2002 US &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/george-bush/"&gt;President George W Bush&lt;/a&gt; dined at the New Island with Putin and a year later the Russian president celebrated his birthday there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although not a cook himself, Prigozhin soon earned the nickname “Putin’s chef” and the trust of Russia’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opposition leader Alexei Navalny — now behind bars — said of Prigozhin: “He became something like the court jester.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon he was awarded £2.5billion-worth of government contracts to cater for the army, schools and state banquets. Riches flowed and the father of three — married to business-woman Lyubov — was said to own a £7.5million estate, a private jet and a 121ft yacht worth £4.4million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then he went from Putin’s chef to his private military contractor. In 2014 Prigozhin’s Wagner Group — named after Hitler’s favourite composer — began fighting in Ukraine’s Donbas region as Russia attempted to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaining a fearsome reputation for barbarity, the mercenary group propped up &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bashar-al-assad/"&gt;Bashar al-Assad’s&lt;/a&gt; regime in Syria, where a video showed&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wagner murderers smashing a prisoner’s wrists and ankles with a sledgehammer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they laughed as they decapitated the man and torched his remains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian journalist Denis Korotkov identified one of the killers as a former Russian policeman and said: “They’re out of control. I don’t think it’s an isolated case.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin glories in his army’s grisly reputation. Russian shops are selling a Wagner-engraved “souvenir” sledgehammer, etched with the mercenary fighters’ logo and a pile of skulls, in a presentation box that resembles a coffin as well as similarly-branded key rings and car stickers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when the EU parliament labelled Russia a state sponsor of terrorism last November, Prigozhin said he was sending them one of the hammers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a video posted on one of Wagner’s Telegram channels, a sledgehammer daubed with fake blood was then seen being packed into a violin case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another film Prigozhin told “traitors” and rich Russians abroad: “The Wagner sledge-hammer will be waiting for you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For much of the unprompted invasion of Ukraine, which began last February, Wagner mercenaries have been engaged in “human wave” attacks at the logistics hub of Bakhmut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Former Wagner recruit Andrei Medvedev, now seeking asylum in Norway, said: “They would round up those who did not want to fight and shoot them in front of newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They buried them in the trenches dug by the trainees.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, after months of trench warfare, Prigozhin claimed to have planted a Russian flag on the city’s town hall, adding that “in a legal sense, Bakhmut is ours”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt; robustly deny the city has fallen. Yet the 50,000-strong private army — around a quarter of Russian forces in Ukraine — has added considerably to Prigozhin’s clout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has publicly insulted Russia’s military top brass, even “behaving like a parallel government”, as one analyst put it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some believe he may even be jockeying to succeed Putin as president. Yet recently there are signs that Putin may be reining in his former caterer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wagner can now no longer recruit from prisons and some believe the Russian high command has starved his group of munitions and support to cut Prigozhin down to size.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ex-Wagner man Medvedev — who calls his former commander “mad” — predicts a grisly end, saying: “Once this whole spectacle is over, I think his own men will kill him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin’s chef may yet feel a sledgehammer blow himself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A LONG-standing scientific debate over the cause of bizarre &amp;#8220;fairy circles&amp;#8221; may have been solved by ancient knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mysterious patches of bare earth can be found across deserts in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21944961" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/80-140-kilometres-coast-namib-807839199.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21944961" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;SWNS&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Fairy circles are patches of bare earth found in desert grass. Stock picture[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;So-called &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/12759303/fairy-circles-desert-alan-turing/"&gt;fairy circles&lt;/a&gt; are distinct patches of clear soil found in desert grass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A worldwide discussion was sparked back in the 1970s when they were first recorded by scientists in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/south-africa"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s Namib desert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from around the globe agreed in 2016 that the polka dot spots in the Australian landscape were caused by spinifex plants competing for water and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Indigenous Australians have insisted the patches pop up as a result of spinifex termites burrowing beneath the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now admitted in a study published in &lt;a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-01994-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/a&gt; that researchers &amp;#8220;barely considered the existing knowledge&amp;#8221; of these people when concluding previously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Fiona Walsh, one of the scientists who took part in the study, told the &lt;a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://thewest.com.au/technology/science/australian-aboriginals-help-solve-mystery-of-desert-fairy-circles--c-10248330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;West Australian&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;Aboriginal people told us that these regular circular patterns of bare pavements are occupied by spinifex termites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We saw similarities between the patterns in Aboriginal art and aerial views of the pavements and found paintings that have deep and complex stories about the activities of termites and termite ancestors.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fairy circles were used by Indigenous People in the past as a way to find food sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Martu elder Gladys Bidu said: “I learnt this from my old people and have seen it myself many times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We gathered and ate the Warturnuma [flying termites] that flew from linyji.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said her ancestors also used the rock hard circles to break open and crush seeds for use in food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researches surveyed areas in Australia&amp;#8217;s Pilbara region as well as patches in Newhaven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Walsh added: &amp;#8220;[This] provided alternative scientific evidence to the dominant international theory explaining the fairy circle phenomenon in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The water-holding characteristics of termite pavements were unknown to desert scientists until we recognised clues in the stories of our Aboriginal colleagues and Aboriginal art.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Aboriginal people refined their encyclopedia and authoritative knowledge when living continuously on this continent for at least 65,000 years and their knowledge is critical to improving ecosystem management and in understanding and caring for Australia’s desert.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GERMAN rapper Marteria has been arrested after being accused of choking a woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The artist &amp;#8211; real name Marten Laciny &amp;#8211; was taken into custody in &lt;a href="https://thesun.co.uk/where/north-carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, US, after the alleged assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21943977" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 649px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000807829369.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=639" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21943977" width="639" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;German rapper Marteria was arrested in the US after being accused of assault[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21945025" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 537px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/german-rapper-materia-arrested-us-807832936.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=527" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21945025" width="527" height="656" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Mecklenburg County Sheriff&amp;#039;s Office Rapper&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The 40-year-old has been released on bail[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Laciny, 40, was arrested on March 30 but has since been released on a $5,000 (£4,000) bail, reports &lt;a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/rapper-marteria-in-arrest-wegen-mutmasslicher-koerperverletzung-a-34e95614-cfd2-4bdf-8852-e75ec1f92d9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Spiegal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is understood the artist &amp;#8211; who has one son &amp;#8211; is due in court on April 18.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before bursting onto the music scene, Laciny played football for Hansa Rostock and Germany&amp;#8217;s under 17s squad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then was scouted in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-york-city/"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; for modelling work, and worked with Hugo Boss and Diesel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Laciny, who also goes by the alter ego Marsimoto, then decided to move back to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a career in music. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has so far sold more than three million records after having success with tracks such as Verstrahlt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tune, which features singer Yasha, is featured in the video game FIFA 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laciny later trained as an actor and has appeared on several TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also became familiar on TV as the face of Fisherman&amp;#8217;s Friend advertising in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laciny last released an album in 2021, but in an &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; story on Tuesday he hinted at another coming this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He did not comment on the allegations in the post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Sun has contacted Laciny&amp;#8217;s management for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A PET owner was absolutely shocked to discover what their adorable little puppy grew into.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikTok &lt;/a&gt;video reveals baby Bruce transform from a cute pup to a boisterous giant schnauzer that his family can barely handle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21943039" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 428px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7c4d0403-a15e-43a9-9f8a-37bd04df5618.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=418" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21943039" width="418" height="567" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bruce starts off as an adorable puppy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;dianaserranoc/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942897" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 419px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/went-tiny-puppy-something-different-807804893.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=409" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942897" width="409" height="626" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;dianaserranoc/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The sweet pup gets much larger[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942895" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 427px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/went-tiny-puppy-something-different-807804888.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=417" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942895" width="417" height="676" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;dianaserranoc/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He very quickly becomes a ginormous dog[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The TikToker, who goes by &lt;a aria-label="@dianaserranoc (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dianaserranoc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;@dianaserranoc&lt;/a&gt;, shared a collection of videos of her adored pet Bruce, from a young pup to turning one years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in this time, Bruce starts to look like a different dog altogether. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pup just keeps on growing until he&amp;#8217;s almost the size of an adult human, and he becomes incredibly fast and hugely energetic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow dog-lovers could not believe the transformation and rushed to the comment section to share their love for the giant schnauzer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Your schnauzer is beautiful,&amp;#8221; responded one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I want one so bad,&amp;#8221; said another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third wrote: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve got two female pepper salts and I&amp;#8217;ve had five total. AMAZING DOGS&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The creator directly responded saying: &amp;#8220;Wow you&amp;#8217;ve got two &amp;#8211; I can barely handle having one lol we got him through a family friend&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not surprising its owner can barely handle Bruce, he&amp;#8217;s huge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other news, a couple who thought they had rescued an innocent-looking kitten &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7790615/couple-rescued-kitten-home-bobcat-wild/"&gt;had the shock of their lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The family, from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://the-sun.com/where/tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, had no idea what they were holding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an Illinois man rescued a seemingly adorable puppy on the side of the road and took it in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21909738/puppy-dumped-shocked-turned-cayote/"&gt;before discovering what it truly was.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good Samaritan took in the lonely pup and brought her in a box to the local police believing it was a lost pet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942892" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 425px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/went-tiny-puppy-something-different-807804891.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=415" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942892" width="415" height="596" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;dianaserranoc/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Bruce certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t look much like his former self[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21943175" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 419px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/050914e8-a9f7-4c4b-8be3-7fe38bf1ad28.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=409" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21943175" width="409" height="355" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;He&amp;#8217;s loud, boisterous and very energetic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;dianaserranoc/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A TEENAGER had her hands and feet cut off before she was burned alive in her car.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The body of Ariki Rigby, 18, was found by a horrified dog walker following the sickening attack in Havelock North, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-zealand"&gt;New Zealand.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21943156" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 614px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/18-hands-feet-severed-burned-807816687.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=604" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21943156" width="604" height="335" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Ariki Rigy, 18, had her hands and feet cut off before she was burned in her car[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Her body was so badly burned that cops first mistook it for a sheep carcass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ariki&amp;#8217;s sister Anahera&amp;nbsp;told&amp;nbsp;true crime podcast The Felon Show: &amp;#8220;You know they do say that she had broken bones. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I suppose they forgot to mention that she also had her hands and feet cut off.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She fears her sister never would have been found if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for the dog walker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ariki was killed early in September last year, but cops didn&amp;#8217;t realise her remains were inside until a passerby urged officers to return to the scene two days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anahera added: &amp;#8220;They [police] were going to get the car towed and crushed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;”We were so grateful that they found her otherwise she would have forever been declared a missing person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;”They had done a lot to her. I found out so much about her.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But months on, police are yet to arrest anyone in connection with Ariki&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officers previously said potential witnesses may not have come forward due to the possible gang affiliations of those thought to be responsible, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/ariki-rigby-homicide-sister-reveals-sad-new-details/EK252VM5FNAPTGOCUFAXBL3R3E/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NZ Herald&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The teen was visiting family when she was brutally killed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anahera told the podcast: &amp;#8220;The last memory I have is of her walking out my door and jumping in her car. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The window wouldn’t go up so I had to put a rubbish bag over it. It was raining. That was a sign she shouldn’t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was begging her to stay but she didn’t want to. I kept trying to tell her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She wanted to go to Hastings and I told her, ‘You got beaten up there’.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;figure id="attachment_21942738" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 347px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/creeps-i-got-shock-life-807804383.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=337" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942738" width="337" height="543" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/@theedgenz&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The hosts of the podcast could not believe the story[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942737" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 348px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/creeps-i-got-shock-life-807804382.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=338" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942737" width="338" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/@theedgenz&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Their shock was written all over their faces[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The unnamed OnlyFans creator explains that she has a terrible story and then starts with: &amp;#8220;So my cousin&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The various hosts look absolutely horrified as they wait anxiously to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She confirms it was a male cousin who subscribed to her account as the hosts straight away ask: &amp;#8220;Did you confront them?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She responds: &amp;#8220;No, I just blocked them instantly.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The story gets worse, with the woman adding: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s hard I mean he&amp;#8217;s married, he has children, it&amp;#8217;s a situation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One host asks: &amp;#8220;Did the wife ever find out?&amp;#8221;, to which she replies: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think so&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Horrified followers rammed the comments, with one summing up the situation: &amp;#8220;the collective shock&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Legally this was&amp;#8230; not legal,&amp;#8221; another adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;THE WAY I DROPPED MY PHONE SO QUICK,&amp;#8221; one responded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a strange turn of events, it seems this OnlyFans creator was not the only one to experience the unique and creepy situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A user confessed: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure my uncle followed me&amp;#8221;. Another wrote: &amp;#8220;The worst was my brother in law&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mystery woman didn&amp;#8217;t stop there though, she also shared with the podcast a painfully awkward story that had the hosts cringing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A good friend of mine&amp;#8217;s boyfriend [followed me] and he signed up with his first and last names,&amp;#8221; she admits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hosts gasp in shock. &amp;#8220;I screenshotted it right away in case he tried to unsubscribe or anything.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model then explains that she asked him whether he&amp;#8217;s still with his girlfriend to which he says &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; and then tries to &amp;#8220;bribe&amp;#8221; her to keep it &amp;#8220;on the down low&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I screenshotted it all&amp;#8230; and ended up meeting up with her and telling her all about it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She ends with the revelation that, in spite of the boyfriend&amp;#8217;s naughty behaviour, the couple are still together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, a cash-strapped mum turned to OnlyFans but found that the price of being on the adult site was too much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arabella Francis told The Sun the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/21883563/stacey-slater-onlyfans-eastenders-mum-cash/"&gt;experienced ruined her life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942739" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 348px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/creeps-i-got-shock-life-807804384.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=338" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942739" width="338" height="545" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/@theedgenz&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The hosts of The Edge podcast were horrified by the woman&amp;#8217;s story[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE alleged assassin accused of killing a pro-Putin propagandist has been paraded in a glass cage in court after being charged with terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; blogger &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, was killed&lt;/a&gt; on&amp;nbsp;Sunday after a bomb ripped through a St Petersburg café where he was giving a talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942355" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darya-trepova-suspected-killing-russian-807791509-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942355" width="960" height="664" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Daria Trepova was locked in a glass cage as she appeared in court[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940408" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940408" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, real name Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb blast in St Petersburg[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942386" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-according-investigative-committee-russian-807792751-1.jpg?strip=all" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942386" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The former art student bowed her head during the hearing[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Former art student Daria Trepova is alleged to have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932672/russian-blogger-killed-video-st-petersburg/"&gt;handed Tatarsky a statue with a bomb&lt;/a&gt; hidden inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 26-year-old anti-war activist was today hauled into a Russian court with her hood up flanked by security guards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She then bowed her head as she sat locked in a glass cage throughout the hearing in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow"&gt;Moscow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators remanded Trepova in custody until June 2, Russian news agencies reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes after new footage emerged showing pro-Putin propagandist Tatarsky engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/"&gt;Trepova, who was arrested on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova appears to be trying to edge out of the room &amp;#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &amp;#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the café &amp;#8211; perhaps to shield herself &amp;#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further distressing footage appears to show the exact moment the bomb &amp;#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &amp;#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the cafe moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s health ministry said 40 other people had been injured in the blast, and 25 were still in hospital on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &amp;#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The charges carry a maximum jail term of 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova&amp;#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has been claimed &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21939569/putin-personally-ordered-blogger-tatarsky-assassination/"&gt;Putin personally ordered Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s assassination&lt;/a&gt; and will use it to crush his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telegram channel General SVR&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &amp;#8211; claimed the Russian tyrant was &amp;#8220;pleased&amp;#8221; with the killing of Tatarsky, and the successful hit will supposedly be used to fuel a new wave of attacks on his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The channel claimed: &amp;#8220;The liquidation of Tatarsky is a &amp;#8216;brilliant&amp;#8217; FSB special operation, according to Putin, which went exactly according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The development of the special operation and the choice of the victim were agreed with the president.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Putin congratulated the leadership of the FSB and recommended it to continue in the same spirit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Tatarsky &amp;#8211; whose real name was Maxim Fomin &amp;#8211; supported Putin, he was also a vocal critic of the Kremlin&amp;#8217;s leading military commanders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Putin was informed by his spies that Tatarsky was an &amp;#8220;out of control moron military officer who only harms&amp;#8221;, General SVR claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Telegram channel&amp;#8217;s claims cannot be independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ONE savvy woman told how she dodged a restaurant cancellation fee with a clever hack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Val from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/san-francisco/"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; was shocked to hear horror stories from diners who were hit with £400 fees for bailing on their bookings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942309" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 706px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tiktok6.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=696" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942309" width="696" height="694" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Val from San Francisco is fed up of being charged for cancelling restaurant bookings[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942251" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 393px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/i-dodged-paying-restaurant-cancellation-807808161.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=383" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942251" width="383" height="622" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;eatprayvibe/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Val shared her clever hack online[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;In a recent video, the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikToker &lt;/a&gt;who goes by &lt;a aria-label="@eatprayvibe (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eatprayvibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;@eatprayvibe&lt;/a&gt; said: &amp;#8220;Why should I have to pay just give the table to someone else.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She admits she dodges fines by locking her card so the cancellation payment wouldn&amp;#8217;t go through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American then uses a filter to depict her running from cops who chase her for her cheeky actions &amp;#8211; clearly making fun of restaurants policies of charging guests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hilarious video has clearly struck a chord with others who shared her frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the only way,&amp;#8221; one writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another says: &amp;#8220;This is so smart&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Me,&amp;#8221; writes a third.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another TikToker was keen to share her fury at being charged £500 for cancelling a restaurant booking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lorida Quiambao &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21906062/charged-cancelling-restaurant-booking-two-days-notice/"&gt;was left stunned when she received an email&lt;/a&gt; that informed her she had been charged a huge late cancellation fee even 48 hours in advance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the Australian hit back at the restaurant by taking to the internet to slam the fee as &amp;#8220;ridiculous&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She wrote in an angry post: &amp;#8220;I understand cancellation fees. I’ve worked in hospitality before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They will probably book that table and make the money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No restaurant or business should be allowed to charge these kinds of cancellation fees as an offhanded thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942254" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 392px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/i-dodged-paying-restaurant-cancellation-807808164.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=382" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942254" width="382" height="605" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;eatprayvibe/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The American then made fun of the cancellation fee policy by pretending the cops were after her for not paying[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21942252" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 389px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/i-dodged-paying-restaurant-cancellation-807808162.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=379" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21942252" width="379" height="622" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;eatprayvibe/TikTok&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Val is clearly not the only one fed up with being charged for cancellations[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JAILED journo Evan Gershkovich is a victim of &amp;#8220;state hostage taking&amp;#8221; designed to castrate US foreign policy, MPs have warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia Kearns, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the Wall Street Journal reporter had been held on &amp;#8220;on questionable or trumped-up charges&amp;#8221; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920468/us-demands-release-of-wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-in-call-with-sergei-lavrov-after-outrageous-arrest/"&gt;demanded Russia free him immediately.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21941963" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-secretary-state-antony-blinken-807329700-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21941963" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Evan was charged with espionage in a Moscow court[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21931350/evan-gershkovich-hostage-russia-jerome-starkey/"&gt;Evan Gershkovich&lt;/a&gt;’s case is the latest in a series of arrests by autocratic abductor states of high-worth nationals on questionable or trumped-up charges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While it isn’t clear what &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;’s intentions are, at best Mr Gershkovich has been arrested for propaganda purposes, and at worst as attempted leverage by Putin to try and lessen American support for Ukraine or to secure a prisoner exchange.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ms Kearns added: “The Russian authorities have an opportunity to settle this matter quickly and release Mr Gershkovich. I urge them to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/us"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-born reporter, 31, was seized by secret police on bogus spying charges last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the charges and published an article on how&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-cd03b0f3"&gt;the country he loved had turned against him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His arrest was also strongly condemned by journalists globally who have been showing their support with the hashtag #IStandWithEvan on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Evan were granted a brief visit to the jailhouse he is being held in on Tuesday almost a week after he was detained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They say the well-respected journalist is in &amp;#8220;good health&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WSJ editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said: &amp;#8220;We are encouraged that Evan’s lawyers, retained by Dow Jones, were able to meet with him in prison today. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We continue to call for his immediate release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am very proud of how this newsroom has come together, not only to stand in solidarity with Evan, but to also advocate for him vigorously, both as a fellow journalist and a friend.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;US President Biden and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21930322/rishi-sunak-evan-gershkovich-russia-arrest/"&gt;PM Rishi Sunak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21930533/evan-gershkovich-jailed-russia-uk-govt/"&gt;called for his immediate release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kearns said rogue states used the &amp;#8220;tactics of terrorists to castrate other governments”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Labour’s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy demanded the government &amp;#8220;do all they can&amp;#8221; to help the US secure his return.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow Labour MP Chris Bryant added: &amp;#8220;Foreign Office ministers should be on the phone day in, day out to make it clear that these made-up claims are a tissue of lies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Free and fair reporting is an essential part of a free and fair society.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It came as a Russian tycoon who fled house in Italy revealed that he had escaped to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Artem Uss, 40, was due to be extradited to America to face charges of busting sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told the pro-Kremlin RIA Novosti news: &amp;#8220;I am in Russia.&amp;#8221;During these particularly dramatic days, strong and reliable people were with me. Thanks to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Brit dual national Vladimir Kara-Murza is facing decades in Russian jails after he was accused of high treason last year for slamming Putin&amp;#8217;s “regime of murderers” in an interview with CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PARANOID Putin personally ordered a Russian blogger&amp;#8217;s assassination and will use it to crush his rivals, a supposed Kremlin insider has claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pro-Putin propagandist &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, was killed on&lt;/a&gt; Sunday after a bomb ripped through a St Petersburg café where he was giving a talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940408" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940408" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, real name Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb blast in St Petersburg[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940523" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-meets-807787081.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940523" width="960" height="638" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;It&amp;#8217;s claimed Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Tatarsky[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940417" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497194-4.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940417" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Suspect Daria Trepova, 26, filmed moments after passing the statue to Tatarsky[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21940389" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darya-trepova-suspected-killing-russian-807791509.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21940389" width="960" height="664" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Darya Trepova has been charged over the death of Vladlen Tatarsky[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21932672/russian-blogger-killed-video-st-petersburg/"&gt;charged Darya Trepova&lt;/a&gt;, 26, with terrorism offences over the murder of the pro-war military blogger. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blast took place in a building owned by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/"&gt;Wagner chief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; sparking fresh speculation over tensions between the mercenary group and Putin&amp;#8217;s forces. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Telegram channel General SVR&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &amp;#8211; has now suggested &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Mad Vlad&lt;/a&gt; was behind the assassination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The channel claimed the Russian tyrant was &amp;#8220;pleased&amp;#8221; with the killing of Tatarsky &amp;#8211; and the successful hit will supposedly be used to fuel a new wave of attacks on his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The liquidation of Tatarsky is a &amp;#8216;brilliant&amp;#8217; FSB special operation, according to Putin, which went exactly according to plan,&amp;#8221; General SVR said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The development of the special operation and the choice of the victim were agreed with the president.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Putin congratulated the leadership of the FSB and recommended it to continue in the same spirit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Tatarsky &amp;#8211; real name was Maxim Fomin &amp;#8211; supported Putin, he was also a vocal critic of the Kremlin&amp;#8217;s leading military commanders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Putin was informed by his spies that Tatarsky was an &amp;#8220;out of control moron military officer who only harms&amp;#8221;, General SVR claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Telegram channel&amp;#8217;s claims cannot be independently verified. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Danilo delle Fave, military and intelligence analyst for ITSS Verona, also told The Sun Online the attack could have been carried out by the FSB. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The conquest of Bakhmut has become a matter of prestige for Wagner &amp;#8211; if they manage to conquer the city they will put in shame the Russian army,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since Fomin was close to Wagner, and the event was staged in a Prigozhin-owned building, it could be a message the FSB and the military have sent to Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The bomb attack could be the result of the infighting between the Russian establishment and the hardliners that wanted to exploit the war to achieve more power inside the Russian institutions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Fave also suggested the assassination &amp;#8211; likely carried out by a small group of plotters &amp;#8211; could have also been a false flag attack to ramp up support for Putin&amp;#8217;s government. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The current mobilisation effort is sluggish, and an attack in the heart of the Russian Federation could be used to influence people to join the army,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fave also warned: &amp;#8220;We should expect an increase in these kind of events as the Russians are unable to achieve their objectives in Ukraine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Former senior military intelligence officer Philip Ingram also said Tatarsky might have been killed to &amp;#8220;send a message&amp;#8221; to Wagner leader Prigozhin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also suggested it could have been carried out by Russia itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ingram told Sky News Tatarsky was seen as &amp;#8220;a part of Prigozhin&amp;#8217;s inner team&amp;#8221; and was more supportive of the private military group than Putin&amp;#8217;s operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes after new video emerged showing the pro-Putin propogandist engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/"&gt;Trepova, who was arrested on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former art student appears to be trying to edge out of the room &amp;#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &amp;#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the café &amp;#8211; perhaps to shield herself &amp;#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further distressing footage appears to show the exact moment the bomb &amp;#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &amp;#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the cafe moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s Investigative Committee said it has charged Trepova with committing &amp;#8220;a terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The charges carry a maximum jail term of 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It claimed she had acted under instructions from people working on behalf of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee accused Ukrainian intelligence of organising the killing with help from supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova&amp;#8217;s husband said he believes she had been framed and had not known the statue contained explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FINLAND officially joined Nato today &amp;#8211; taking the bloc just 78 miles from Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s home city of St Petersburg.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours before the historic move, Russia warned that Belarusian military aircraft have been upgraded to launch nuclear strikes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/JW-MAP-NATO-FRONTLINE-V5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/JW-MAP-NATO-FRONTLINE-V5.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=847" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21938447" width="847" height="960" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21938700" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/finnish-foreign-minister-pekka-haavisto-807780368.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21938700" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto hands over the accession document to Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21938655" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3654023a-e219-4f42-9c0d-be12301de790.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21938655" width="960" height="621" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pekka Haavisto signs the document to officially join Nato&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Rex&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21938457" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-speeches-807771751.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21938457" width="960" height="767" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russia has voted to ramp up its forces on the border[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Moscow&amp;#8217;s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said: &amp;#8220;Some of the Belarusian ground attack aircraft have gained the ability to strike at enemy targets with nuclear-armed weapons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said some Belarusian jets were now capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and Iskander rocket systems had been moved to Belarus &amp;#8211; which can carry conventional or nuclear missiles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shoigu warned &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/finland/"&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; entry into the military alliance and Nato&amp;#8217;s move to increase its combat readiness has ramped up the risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stark message came on the same day as &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/finland/"&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; long-awaited entry into Nato &amp;#8211; a heavy blow to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto signed the official documents before handing them over Secretary of State Antony Blinken at Nato HQ in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s accession roughly doubles the length of the border Nato shares with Russia &amp;#8211; and bolsters its eastern flank as the war in Ukraine rages on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blinken said: &amp;#8220;With receipt of this instrument of accession, we can now declare that Finland is the 31st member of the North Atlantic Treaty.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland joining the military alliance is a direct result of Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;President Putin wanted to slam Nato&amp;#8217;s door shut,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Today we show the world that he failed, that aggression and intimidation do not work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that Sweden will also become a full-fledged member.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s accession ends decades of the country&amp;#8217;s military non-alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Finland and Sweden applied to join almost 12 months ago &amp;#8211; but it was hampered by a refusal by Hungary and Turkey to ratify the application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PM Rishi Sunak hailed Finland&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;historic&amp;#8221; accession and urged the alliance to admit Sweden next after its entry was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All Nato members now need to take the steps necessary to admit Sweden too, so we can stand together as one alliance to defend freedom in Europe and across the world,&amp;#8221; Sunak said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has created an alliance that is now &amp;#8220;bound tighter together&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said his country will work &amp;#8220;relentlessly&amp;#8221; to secure Sweden&amp;#8217;s membership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Finland&amp;#8217;s membership is not complete without Swedish membership,&amp;#8221; Niinisto said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The work for Sweden&amp;#8217;s early membership continues relentlessly.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move roughly doubles the West&amp;#8217;s frontier facing &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; as Finland and Russia share a painful 810-mile border with one another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor Michael Clarke, from the University of Exeter’s Strategy and Security Institute, said the move will have a &amp;#8220;dramatic effect&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;will become a &amp;#8220;political headache for any leader in Moscow&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “This is the most significant enlargement and military enhancement of Nato since German re-armament in 1955, and it is likely to have a dramatic effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It adds weight to Nato&amp;#8217;s emerging political and military re-orientation towards the north of Europe and the Atlantic.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;President Putin wanted to slam NATO&amp;#8217;s door shut. Today we show the world that he failed, that aggression and intimidation do not work&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color"&gt;
					&lt;span class="quote-credit"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="quote-credit-meta"&gt;Nato chief&lt;/span&gt;				&lt;/cite&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;!--googleon: all--&gt;
	



&lt;p&gt;He said Finland&amp;#8217;s entry will &amp;#8220;add considerable military depth to Nato&amp;#8217;s defensive posture in the Baltic&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will be another political headache for any leader in Moscow contemplating military pressure against Nato Europe,&amp;#8221; he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And in the awful event of a general European war, it would leave Russia&amp;#8217;s northern flank wide open to an effective attack from Scandinavia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This vulnerability now confronts any Russian leader for the next several decades. And Putin has brought it all on Russia by embarking on his crazy war of aggression against a neighbour at the other end of the continent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s statesmanship and strategy of the most perverse kind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nato&amp;#8217;s move has angered Russia which &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21929505/russia-vows-ramp-up-forces-finland-border-joins-nato/"&gt;vowed to &amp;#8220;strengthen our military potential&lt;/a&gt; in the western and northwestern direction&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alexander Grushko, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, told state media Nato&amp;#8217;s expansion called for &amp;#8220;additional steps to reliably ensure Russia&amp;#8217;s military security&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also warned that Moscow will respond depending on what weapons &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt; allies place in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We will closely monitor what will be going on in Finland and how &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt; will use the territory of Finland for the deployment of weapons, equipment and infrastructure next to our border that would potentially threaten us,&amp;#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Measures will be taken dependent on that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mounting pressure from Nato also became the main topic of Russia&amp;#8217;s TV program 60 Minutes and was lambasted by pundits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dmitry Abzalov said the situation involving Finland was a &amp;#8220;mess&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;already out of our hands&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olga Skabeyeva, Russia-1 host, went a step further and claimed the Finnish territory as &amp;#8220;our historical land&amp;#8221; and called for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to take action over Finland&amp;#8217;s looming membership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;We have to liberate the brotherly Finnish people.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It follows last year&amp;#8217;s claims that the Kremlin would take &amp;#8220;adequate countermeasures&amp;#8221; and would send 12 units and divisions to its western military district.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the hostile warning, Finland is expected to join the alliance today &amp;#8211; which has been hailed by the Nato chief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland will become the sixth Nato nation to share a border with Russia, joining&amp;nbsp;Norway, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Finnish contribution will add more than 257,000 troops to the combined forces.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PARANOID Vladimir Putin hides in his bunkers to dodge assassination attempts and is &amp;#8220;mortally afraid&amp;#8221; of contracting Covid, his ex-bodyguard has claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gleb Karakulov, 35,&amp;nbsp;said the tyrant turned into a recluse after becoming obsessed with securing his safety &amp;#8211; and being rattled by fears the West are bugging his calls. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936551" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/handled-vladimir-putin-s-secret-807763105.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936551" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Gleb Karakulov, 35, says Putin has become a recluse[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936512" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/handled-vladimir-putin-s-secret-807763230.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936512" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The former bodyguard has fled to safety after denouncing the war on Ukraine[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936489" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-meets-807763064.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936489" width="960" height="677" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He alleged Putin has been hiding in bunkers to dodge assassination attempts[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The captain in the Federal Guard Service, known as the FGS or FSO, has fled Russia to safety after dishing the dirt on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s regime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He branded the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; President a &amp;#8220;war criminal&amp;#8221; and claimed he has brainwashed his minions to &amp;#8220;worship him in every way&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as Putin tries to keep a grip on his power, Karakulov claims he is also battling his own inner demons in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18097861/paranoid-putin-living-top-secret-nuke-bunkers-nuclear-war/"&gt;complete isolation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He alleged that the warlord now opts to stay &amp;#8220;in his bunker&amp;#8221; rather than make trips like he used to &amp;#8211; fuelling rumours that &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21809587/video-proving-putin-uses-body-doubles-goes-viral/"&gt;the 70-year-old sends body doubles in his place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin has placed himself on &amp;#8220;lockdown&amp;#8221; to minimise the risk of his potential execution and in the hopes of fending off &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov&amp;#8217;s bombshell revelations were published by Dossier independent media, who claim he is the highest-ranking defector so far from Putin’s immediate security circle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The engineer was in the presidential communications directorate and reportedly had access to Putin’s personal communications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has now urged the Russian people to wake up and realise that the President &amp;#8220;has lost touch with the world&amp;#8221; while hiding away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov said: &amp;#8220;He has been living in an information cocoon for the past couple of years, spending most of his time in his residences, which the media very fittingly call bunkers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He is pathologically afraid for his life.&amp;nbsp;He surrounds himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantines and an information vacuum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He only values his own life and the lives of his family and friends.&amp;nbsp;The lives of your family and friends are of no interest to him.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former protection officer, who worked directly under Putin, claims he witnessed the despot&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17990548/inside-putins-paranoid-world/"&gt;descent into paranoia&lt;/a&gt; firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He explained: &amp;#8220;I can tell you that I went on many business trips with him, and he went on many trips before 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;After that, he stayed in his bunker and maybe made just one, maximum, three business trips a year.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claims the Russian leader is so convinced that the West are infiltrating his communications that he takes a special box with him on foreign trips to prevent his secret talks from leaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This box always travels abroad along with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21253237/putin-nuclear-briefcase-armageddon-taunt-to-west/"&gt;Putin’s nuclear suitcase&lt;/a&gt; which he can use to unleash atomic war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov said: &amp;#8220;The President also has a telephone booth we take on every foreign trip. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is a place from which you can conduct talks with guaranteed confidentiality.&amp;nbsp;The booth is, of course, bulky. It is a cube about 2.5 meters high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;STEALTH MODE&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Inside there is a workstation and a telephone, which one can use to talk without fear of these conversations being overheard or read by foreign intelligence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin have already &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21781196/paranoid-putin-bans-iphones-russian-government-officials/"&gt;banned iPhones amid fears they can be hacked by CIA and GCHQ spies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov said: &amp;#8220;I mean, in all my years of service, I haven’t seen him once with a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Putin…he doesn’t use the internet or a mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He only receives information from his closest circle, which means that he lives in an information vacuum.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The engineer had previously installed special communications links for Putin in his planes, helicopters, yachts and armoured train.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of arriving in style, the President is now increasingly using the train &amp;#8220;because it is less conspicuous&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Planes show up on certain [databases],&amp;#8221; Karakulov said. &amp;#8220;Whereas a train, how many of these grey trains are there?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Most importantly, they cannot be tracked on any information resource.&amp;nbsp;It’s done for stealth purposes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He alleged that Putin heavily relies on his close-knit circle of FSO guards, headed by his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19660331/putin-grips-desk-amid-rumour-he-has-parkinsons/"&gt;loyal henchman Viktor Zolotov&lt;/a&gt;, for updates on the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8216;SELF-ISOLATING PRESIDENT&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They reportedly &amp;#8220;call him the Boss, worship him in every way and only ever talk of him in those terms&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this means the warlord&amp;#8217;s knowledge of events is filtered via the secret services &amp;#8211; and what he watches on state-controlled Russian TV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who come in close proximity to Putin to fill his ear must self-quarantine for two weeks, Karakulov claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that his former boss is &amp;#8220;mortally afraid” of Covid and is &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18641455/putins-bunker-food-tasters-checking-poison-fears-assassination/"&gt;isolating himself&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet he says the dictator appears in good health for a 70-year-old, testimony which possibly contradicts &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21923861/putins-health-stomach-pains-isnt-eating/"&gt;repeated claims that he is ailing&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; although it is unclear the captain had access to Putin’s health secrets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov continued: &amp;#8220;We still have a self-isolating President.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We have to observe a strict quarantine for two weeks before any event, even those lasting 15 to 20 minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There is a pool of employees who have been cleared – who underwent this two-week quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are [considered] ‘clean’ and can work in the same room as Putin.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the Federal Guard Service has a strict no talking shop policy &amp;#8211; and daren&amp;#8217;t discuss rumours regarding Putin&amp;#8217;s alleged terminal illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;HEALTH RUMOURS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20160557/putin-parkinsons-pancreatic-cancer-russian-insider-reveals/"&gt;Bombshell spy documents leaked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to The Sun appeared to confirm&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson&amp;#8217;s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov told Dossier: &amp;#8220;It was not something my colleagues discussed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If he has any health issues, they must be due to his age. Well, he probably does have them. But it is nothing too serious, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He is in better health than many other people his age. He has annual medical check-ups.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The defector seemed remarkably ignorant of Putin’s private life with gymnast &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2915889/alina-kabaeva-vladimir-putin-girlfriend/"&gt;Alina Kabaeva&lt;/a&gt;, 39, and their young children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he confirmed Putin has a £1 billion &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17394479/putins-pole-dancing-room-black-sea-mansion/"&gt;cliff top palace at Gelendzhik on the Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18034192/inside-vladimir-putin-superyacht-scheherazade/"&gt;private yacht Scheherazade&lt;/a&gt;, as earlier revealed by Russia’s independent media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov called on his fellow officers to come forward with evidence to out Putin as a &amp;#8220;war criminal&amp;#8221; and stop &amp;#8220;the genocide of the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; people&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a heartfelt appeal, he said: &amp;#8220;You have information that is not broadcast on television.&amp;nbsp;I have only seen a tiny part of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Come forward, support me [with more evidence].&amp;nbsp;You will help our citizens to learn the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am sure that you had questions about the Commander-in-Chief’s actions before, but the oath forced you not to ask [them] and to smoothly execute his orders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class="article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You mustn’t follow criminal orders and serve this war criminal, Vladimir Putin. And I consider him a war criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color"&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;!--googleon: all--&gt;
	



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, what is happening now [with the war in Ukraine] is beyond the pale, it defies reason.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You mustn’t follow criminal orders and serve this war criminal, Vladimir Putin. And I consider him &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21751197/putin-arrest-warrant-international-criminal-court-ukraine/"&gt;a war criminal&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov said the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;is simply beyond comprehension&amp;#8221; as the number of bodies continues to mount. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;You have to stop following these criminal orders.&amp;nbsp;The FGS [FSO] officers are around the President all the time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You can just go in and indicate that this is a crime.&amp;nbsp;It is up to you to stop this madness very quickly. I wish you would do that because it would save many lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Life is the highest value. We have forgotten it in this country. People are considered cannon fodder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This will continue to be the case as long as we remain silent. This war has to end and it is time to break the silence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov &amp;#8211; who worked since 2009 in the FGS &amp;#8211; escaped when he was sent on a business trip to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17239154/putin-empire-soviet-union-kazakhstan/"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for a Putin visit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On this trip in October 2022 &amp;#8211; during the war &amp;#8211; Putin had his own bomb shelter, said the defector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Karakulov’s wife and daughter escaped separately also via Kazakhstan and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, as he did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are not running after me with &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5790210/what-novichok-nerve-agent-alexei-navalny/"&gt;Novichok&lt;/a&gt; [nerve agent] yet, but they have already gone to see my relatives, and I think that the reason for this sluggish interest in me is that they think: ‘There are plenty more of such engineers, one more, one less, who cares!’&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS is the dramatic moment a man cheats death after walking out of a laundrette moments before a tumble dryer explodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage of the extraordinary incident showed he had only closed the door behind him less than ten seconds before the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21937020" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/d8219177-99b9-4c46-8976-8782cbe31d96.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937020" width="960" height="534" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A lucky man cheat death by seconds after walking out of a laundrette before a dryer exploded&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Solarpix&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936937" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solarpix-copyright-waver-notice-fees-807601378.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936937" width="960" height="535" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Solarpix&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The blast caused a huge fireball to be launched across the building[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936944" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solarpix-copyright-waver-notice-fees-807601072.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936944" width="960" height="538" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Solarpix&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The place was left in tatters after the fire smashed the windows and blew up the dryer[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The explosion launched a ball of fire across the building and straight into the spot where he had just been standing after bagging up his clean washing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fireball was so strong it smashed all the windows of the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/"&gt;Spanish &lt;/a&gt;laundrette, and even ripped the front door off its hinges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The building, on the ground floor of a three-storey block, is at the entrance to an industrial estate in the Galician city of La Coruna.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators have concluded the blast was caused by the overheating of flammable fuel in a cigarette lighter which had been left inside a trouser pocket.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shocking footage showed the door of the tumble dryer being blown open before the premises turned a bright orange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Debris was also seen left on the ground inside and outside the laundrette in the wake of the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is understood no-one else was inside at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred around 8pm on March 14 but the video of the blast has only just been made public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports at the time, before the footage emerged, said police and firefighters were among the emergency responders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fire crews are said to have torn down the damaged facade because of a crack in the plaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A witness told a local paper the day after the blast: “We heard a loud noise but it didn’t sound like an explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t think more of it until about ten minutes later the sirens of fire engines began to sound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I went outside and found the whole corner of the street destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The firefighters tore the front wall outside down because there was a crack in it and felt there was a risk it could collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AT least seven people have been killed and dozens more injured after a massive avalanche in India. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major rescue operation is underway after a bus packed with tourists reportedly plunged into a gorge following the avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21937513" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rescue-team-members-search-survivors-807763838.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937513" width="960" height="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;At least seven people have been killed after the huge avalanche[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21937821" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 644px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dd8e2398-586e-4195-a14a-43ae4a0c5b43.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=634" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937821" width="634" height="790" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dozens of tourists are feared to be trapped after the torrent of snow and rocks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21937825" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 337px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5106ce71-6378-4245-a99f-8f82f6885fd9.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=327" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21937825" width="327" height="430" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s understood crowds were taking photos near a stream when the avalanche hit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A child is understood to be among the dead along with four men and one woman with at least 150 trapped, &lt;a aria-label="India Today (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.indiatodayne.in/sikkim/story/massive-avalanche-hits-sikkim-six-including-one-child-among-dead-537263-2023-04-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;India Today&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Indian army said the avalanche smashed into Nathu La, a popular tourist destination between Sikkim and the Chinese region of Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dozens of tourists are feared to be trapped after the torrent of snow and rocks hit five to six vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s understood crowds were also taking photos near a stream when the avalanche hit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 30 trapped tourists were pulled out and rushed to hospital, while around 350 people and 80 vehicles were stranded after snow blocked the roads, &lt;a aria-label="Times of India (opens in a new tab)" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/latest-updates-from-cities-delhi-weatherrain-traffic-karnataka-tamil-nadu-west-bengal-bihar-up-april-4/liveblog/99226667.cms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage showed several bodies strewn across the side of a mountain as local residents crowded around rescue workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police official Tenzing Loden Lepcha&amp;nbsp;said: &amp;#8220;We are yet to ascertain how many people are still trapped. 17 people have been rescued, out of which eight are very critical and have been moved to a hospital.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loden Lepcha said rescue operations were ongoing at the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Indian army is helping with the rescue operation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thousands of tourists flock to Sikkim every year &amp;#8211; also known as the &amp;#8220;Land of Mystic Splendour&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s located below Mount Khangchendzonga, known as Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A WOMAN dubbed the world&amp;#8217;s fittest bodybuilder gran left her fans going wild over her latest bikini shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesley Maxwell, 64, from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/melbourne/"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, is well-known for her incredible ripped physique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936397" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/world-s-fittest-bodybuilder-gran-807730384.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936397" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;lesleymaxwell.fitness/Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The gym gran stunned her Instagram followers after posting a snap of her in an orange bikini[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21936403" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/world-s-fittest-bodybuilder-gran-807730554.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21936403" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;lesleymaxwell.fitness/Instagram&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Lesley says she work out five times a week[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;But she left her fans gushing over her latest &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;post as she can be seen posing in the sun with her toned figure on display.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the photo the ripped gran donned a slinky orange bikini as she candidly walked across the sand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was glowing under the sun as she flaunted her defined abs and muscular arms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesley, who claims to attract men half her age, struck a pose on the beach as her windswept blonde locks flew in front of her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She aptly captioned the post: &amp;#8220;Is there such a thing as a bad day for the beach?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fresh sea air, salt water and a little sunshine makes a perfect health pick me up. Hope you had a great day too&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her post quickly racked up over 2,300 likes and 86 comments, and fans left the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/fitness-and-exercise/"&gt;gym &lt;/a&gt;gran with plenty of compliments after she shared the jaw-dropping snap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One wrote: &amp;#8220;Unbelievable physique!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another said: &amp;#8220;Wow you look amazing x&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third joked: &amp;#8220;The next Bond girl!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gym-obsessed Lesley kick-started her fitness journey in her 40s and hasn&amp;#8217;t looked back since, giving models decades her junior a run for their money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/"&gt;celebrity &lt;/a&gt;fitness coach has said &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/18720089/fit-gran-never-too-old-for-bikini/"&gt;she works out five times a week to maintain her rock-hard abs&lt;/a&gt; and size 8 figure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She revealed how she is constantly bombarded with questions about how she maintains her toned body by her 135,000 Instagram followers &amp;#8211; but is happy to give eager gym-goes tips.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent reel, Lesley said: &amp;#8220;Health and fitness isn&amp;#8217;t just a look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a feeling&amp;#8230; and there&amp;#8217;s no better feeling than having a healthy strong body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The thing is, no one else can actually do the work for you. Even if you paid them to work out for you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20598304/worlds-hottest-gran-crazy-diet-makes-me-so-fit/"&gt;gym gran credits her fitness levels to her strict diet&lt;/a&gt; that powers her through her incredible exercises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a previous post Lesley told her legion of followers to focus on what they are putting into their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She wrote: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m often asked when is the best time to train and my answer may surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For me, as long as I have eaten properly&amp;#8230; then I have energy to train. I always make sure I fuel my body with enough &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7126585/protein-diet-important-weight-loss-muscle/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and fats.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now an author and gym influencer, Lesley uses her social media platforms to inspire others who are on their fitness journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The glam gran also revealed that she is often &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20244023/my-gran-super-fit-64-copies-outfits-crop-tops/"&gt;mistaken for her 20-year-old granddaughter, Tia Christofi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A RAPE survivor has recalled the horrifying ordeal she suffered at the hands of her kidnapper who kept her chained in his basement while torturing her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia &amp;#8220;Kozak&amp;#8221; Kozakiewicz thought she would die when aged 13 she was trapped in a dungeon for four days, chained to a bed and repeatedly beaten and raped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21934094" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 777px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/alicia-kozak-kozakiewicz-motivational-speaker-574958409.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=767" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21934094" width="767" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alicia &amp;#8216;Kozak&amp;#8217; Kozakiewicz has spoken about her ordeal&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21934247" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 520px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/08baec5f-4b5b-4c64-ab86-6215e80fe385-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=510" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21934247" width="510" height="451" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;She was kidnapped when she was just 13&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21934133" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 500px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/motivational-speaker-advocate-internet-safety-807741727.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=490" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21934133" width="490" height="454" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;aliciakozak.com&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Alicia pictured after she was rescued by the FBI[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;But she did survive and bravely battled back from the traumatic experience which she has now used to help others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia has spent the past 20 years after her ordeal, raising awareness for internet safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has become a motivational speaker and missing persons advocate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her nightmare started when her sick captor &amp;#8211; whose name she won&amp;#8217;t speak &amp;#8211; lured her from her parents’ home in Pittsburgh and drove her to his home in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He placed a dog collar around her neck and tied her to a bed before assaulting her and torturing her for days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recalling the horror moments 20 years later, she told &lt;a aria-label="Fox News (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-kidnapping-survivor-remembers-dragging-cold-heavy-chain-from-captors-dungeon-during-rescue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;He put a locking dog collar around my neck and dragged me to his dungeon and raped me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He chained me to the floor with this dog collar next to the bed. I was raped and beaten and tortured in that house for four days.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia confessed she thought she was not going to make it when on the fourth day in captivity, the rapist told her he had started to &amp;#8220;like her too much&amp;#8221; and told her they would &amp;#8220;go for a ride&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I knew in that moment there was nothing I could do. I knew he was going to kill me,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia explained she had almost accepted her fate and in those moments she thought of her parents &amp;#8220;and how much they loved me&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That’s what kept me going, but I knew it was unlikely that I was going to make it out of there alive,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, before the &amp;#8220;ride,&amp;#8221; Alicia heard banging on the door and &amp;#8220;angry voices&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While at the time she didn&amp;#8217;t know it was the FBI, she was relieved to hear the words &amp;#8220;movement over there&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;I remember dragging that cold, heavy chain out, and trying to put my hands up but also trying to cover myself at the same time. I had no clothing on. I was staring at the end of a gun.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia was rescued thanks to a livestream her kidnapper shared online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone who watched the video recognised her from a missing person poster and called the police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2003 Alicia&amp;#8217;s kidnapper was sentenced to 19 years and 7 months in a federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alicia still thinks it was &amp;#8221; a miracle&amp;#8221; she was found after her four-day ordeal in January 2002.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;Another way to say miracle is luck. And children’s safety shouldn’t be left up to luck.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty years on, Alicia fights to highlight online-related child abduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside&amp;nbsp;the National Association to Protect Children&amp;nbsp;to enact Alicia&amp;#8217;s Law, which provides funding to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program.&lt;/p&gt;

					Women&amp;#039;s Aid has this advice for victims and their families:				&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always keep your phone nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are in danger, call 999.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution, reporting abuse without speaking down the phone, instead dialing “55”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always keep some money on you, including change for a pay phone or bus fare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to go to a lower-risk area of the house – for example, where there is a way out and access to a telephone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other weapons. Avoid rooms where you might become trapped, such as the bathroom, or where you might be shut into a cupboard or other small space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a ­victim of domestic abuse, SupportLine is open Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 6pm to 8pm on 01708 765200.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A BABY was found dead under a bed in a squalid flat hours after the mum was allegedly filmed partying. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three-month-old&amp;#8217;s decomposing body was discovered in a locked room after cops raided the home.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933292" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/squalid-flat-baby-found-baby-807706327.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933292" width="960" height="366" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The three-month-old&amp;#8217;s body was discovered under a bed in a locked room[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933340" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cbc80b29-ba25-4a3a-baad-fd5aa262e5b1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933340" width="960" height="945" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Horrifying pictures showed the state of the home where the kids had been left&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933069" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/squalid-flat-baby-found-baby-807706873.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933069" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Jam Press&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The squalid flat where the baby was found[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Police found three other young children &amp;#8211; aged 10, eight and three &amp;#8211; on their own in the filthy property in Itapevi, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The baby appeared to have died of starvation several weeks before it was found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other kids in the house couldn&amp;#8217;t get into the sealed room where their sibling&amp;#8217;s body was reportedly decomposing under the grubby bed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pictures showed the keyhole on the door stuffed with cotton wool to stop anyone going inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops had raided the property after concerned neighbours reported a foul smell coming from the home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And horrifying pictures revealed the shocking state of the neglected property with piles of rotting rubbish, soiled mattresses, and battered toys strewn across the floor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police said the repulsive home had descended into squalor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to reports, the mum was not at home with the kids when police stormed the property on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neighbours told officers she often left her children alone for days at a time to go out partying, Diario de Goias reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also claimed that she stopped their dad from visiting them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After being tracked down, she was quizzed by cops and later released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She faces charges of child abandonment, child mistreatment, concealment of a corpse, and homicide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The baby&amp;#8217;s cause of death has not been confirmed, but detectives suspect it died of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;UNSEEN footage captures the chilling moment a Putin ally meets his alleged killer moments before he was murdered in a devastating explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; blogger &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky was assassinated on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; after a bomb ripped through the St Petersburg cafe where he was giving a talk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933381" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vladlen-tatarsky-40-seen-moments-807704462.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933381" width="960" height="646" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;New video shows the moment Russian blogger Vladlen Tatarsky is assassinated[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933403" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vladlen-tatarsky-40-seen-moments-807704461.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933403" width="960" height="636" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He was allegedly killed by a bomb hidden in a golden statuette of himself[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933410" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/known-vladlen-tatarsky-nastya-seen-807704458.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933410" width="960" height="681" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Video shows his suspected assassin Daria Trepova handing him the &amp;#8216;bomb&amp;#8217;[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933416" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sits-close-vladlen-tatarsky-moments-807704405.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933416" width="960" height="654" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She then takes a seat seconds before the explosion[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Now new video has emerged showing the pro-&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; propagandist, 40, engaging with the woman accused of his slaughter just seconds before the bomb went off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video, 26-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/"&gt;Daria Trepova, who was arrested on Monday for Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s murder&lt;/a&gt;, can be seen backing away after handing the suspected bomb over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former art student appears to be trying to edge out of the room &amp;#8211; possibly to escape the explosion &amp;#8211; as Tatarsky asks her to sit at the front with him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she compromises by taking a seat near the front but to the side, several metres away from the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen raising her hands as she takes her seat in the cafe &amp;#8211; perhaps to shield herself &amp;#8211; moments before the screen goes dark as the bomb goes off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Trepova was officially charged with committing a &amp;#8220;terrorist act by an organised group that caused intentional death&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tatarsky was the only person killed in the blast, which injured some 30 people, leaving ten in a critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t known how Tatarsky knew Trepova, and what reason she had given for why she was presenting him with the statuette.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further distressing footage purports to show the exact moment the bomb &amp;#8211; which was disguised as a statuette of Tatarsky &amp;#8211; detonates after the blogger placed it back in its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a third short clip shows former art student Trepova exiting the cafe moments after the explosion, as blood-soaked victims emerge from the blast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen quietly leaving the scene in the chaotic aftermath of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as pro-Putin media rushes to finger Trepova for the murder of Tatarsky, a day after she was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian cops are also hunting for the maker of the statuette, which was filled with TNT explosives before being delivered by Trepova.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She has claimed she was framed for the killing, although she is believed to have lied about her name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the clip taken seconds before Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s death, he is heard calling her &amp;#8220;Nasty&amp;#8221; (Anastasia) as he opens the package she had given him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It purportedly showed the military blogger on the frontline in the war in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He asks her to sit near him, to which she replies: &amp;#8220;I am too shy,&amp;#8221; before taking a seat in a chair away to the side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tatarsky &amp;#8211; real name Maxim Fomin &amp;#8211; then examines the gold-coloured statuette, exclaiming: &amp;#8220;Oh wow! What a beautiful lad, is it me? Let&amp;#8217;s take it out&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Appearing pleased, he goes on: &amp;#8220;A golden Vladlen, perfect,&amp;#8221; before joking: &amp;#8220;Thank god, I am much better looking.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he places the statuette back in its packaging, it explodes, killing Tatarsky instantly.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;!--googleoff: all--&gt;
	&lt;blockquote class="article__quote"&gt;
		&lt;div class="article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful lad, is it me?&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color"&gt;
					&lt;span class="quote-credit"&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="quote-credit-meta"&gt;Russian blogger&lt;/span&gt;				&lt;/cite&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;!--googleon: all--&gt;
	



&lt;p&gt;The footage was shared by the pro-Kremlin media group 112, which has links to law enforcement and Russia&amp;#8217;s security services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It shows Trepova &amp;#8211; seemingly uninjured &amp;#8211; leaving the cafe in an overcoat after briefly exchanging words with another person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is then alleged to have gone back to a St Petersburg apartment where she cropped her hair to try and disguise her appearance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Authorities claim she had booked a flight to the Central Asian country of Uzbekistan as part of her escape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But agents from the feared secret service the FSB along with officers from the Russian Investigative Committee later tracked her down and raided the apartment, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21931448/assassin-bombed-putin-blogger-interrogated-radiator/"&gt;handcuffing her to a radiator during their search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21933451" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/real-name-maxim-fomin-killed-807596030.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933451" width="960" height="538" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Footage shows Trepova being arrested at her apartment[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21933461" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 764px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-according-investigative-committee-russian-807567946-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=754" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21933461" width="754" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trepova has claimed she is being set up[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Pro-military outlets have branded the explosion a &amp;#8220;terrorist&amp;#8221; attack, although the exact reasons for Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s assassination are unclear at this point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although some claim that he was killed by anti-war protesters, others allege that this may have been an attack in retaliation for his criticism of Putin&amp;#8217;s generals and the way they had fought in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third group has said that the bombing may have been a false flag operation to pin the blame on suspected opposition groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Danilo delle Fave, military and intelligence analyst for ITSS Verona, told The Sun Online: &amp;#8220;The current Russian leadership has used false flags on several occasions to increase the support to the government.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the 1999 apartment bombings which were pinned on Chechen terrorists and helped to catapult the then-unknown Putin to power the following year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a targeted attack could then be used to spur support for the stalling &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;We see that the current mobilization effort is sluggish, an attack in the heart of the Russian Federation could be used to influence people to join the army.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A false flag is therefore a credible hypothesis.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delle Fave went on: &amp;#8220;The way in which the attack has been conducted &amp;#8211; a bomb inside a statue &amp;#8211; suggests that the plotters are probably a small group.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that the attack lacked the sophistication and planning of the assassination which killed the daughter of pro-Putin figure Alexander Dugin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delle Fave said that a third theory was that this was the result of infighting between the Russian security establishment and the hardliners such as Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations such as the Wagner Group have long called for a far more extreme approach to the conflict, and have slammed the perceived caution of Russia&amp;#8217;s generals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I think that only time will tell which of these three hypotheses is the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In any case, we should expect an increase in these kinds of events, since the Russians are unable to achieve their objectives in Ukraine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AT LEAST one person has been killed and around 30 injured after a passenger train derailed and burst into flames in the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passengers were left screaming in terror as the train left the tracks in the early hours of the morning near the village of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/netherlands/"&gt;Voorschhoten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932591" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/one-dead-several-seriously-injured-807711037.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932591" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Splash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;At least one person was killed in the horror crash in the early hours of Tuesday[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932254" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1abafa2a-41a1-4acd-8749-2b49e3f1b55f.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932254" width="960" height="645" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A fire broke out in the rear carriage as trapped passengers desperately tried to escape&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Rex&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932231" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/one-person-died-several-people-807694603.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932231" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;At least 30 injured people were being treated on scene, emergency services said[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932245" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/05cc70ee-b004-4079-a687-b71df060037b.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932245" width="960" height="642" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Shocking images show the derailed carriages slumped across the tracks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Rex&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up to 50 people on board were trapped in the darkness in overturned carriages after the train slammed into construction equipment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was travelling to The Hague from Leiden when it collided with the apparatus at around 3.25am local time this morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest the double-decker train had stuck a construction crane that was on or near the track.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A fire is believed to have then broken out in the rear carriages after it derailed around 34 miles south of the capital &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/amsterdam/"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chilling images from the scene show plumes of black smoke billowing from the wreckage after it erupted in flames.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The front carriage appears to have left the tracks and ploughed into a field, while the second landed on its side, ANP reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survivors were forced to clamber over a canal using makeshift bridges as rescuers worked to free passengers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambulance services, including a trauma helicopter, rushed to the scene after the devastating crash. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hollands Midden emergency services said at least 30 injured people were being treated on scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another 11 were being treated in the houses of local residents while the most seriously injured were rushed to nearby hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The death toll and severity of injuries sustained was not immediately clear. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One witness described the moment of sheer terror as people were left scrambling in the darkness when the train crashed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unidentified traveller told the local Omroep West television news channel: &amp;#8220;We heard a loud bang and suddenly the lights went out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We couldn’t initially get out of the train because there was no electricity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some images of the wreckage show a string of broken windows in the carriages, although it is unclear if this was caused by the crash or passengers&amp;#8217; escape attempts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte paid tribute to the victims of the horror train in a tweet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He wrote: &amp;#8220;A terrible train accident near Voorschoten, where unfortunately one person died and many people were injured. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My thoughts are with the relatives and with all the victims. I wish them all the best.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dutch Railways said that trains between Leiden and parts of The Hague were cancelled due to the collision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;John Voppen, CEO of the rail network company Pro Rail, called the incident &amp;#8220;a black day for Dutch railways&amp;#8221; and said the cause of the crash was under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials from the Dutch Safety Board &amp;#8211; a body that conducts independent investigations into accidents &amp;#8211; have been dispatched to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932587" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/one-dead-several-seriously-injured-807711277.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932587" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Splash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The front carriages left the tracks and ploughed into a field[/caption]

&lt;figure id="attachment_21932582" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emergency-service-personnel-work-site-807709703.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932582" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;One passenger described how they were plunged into darkness during the smash[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21932230" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/least-one-person-died-30-807700423.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21932230" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The train collided with construction equipment in the early hours of Tuesday morning[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;SHOCKING footage shows a woman who allegedly killed a Kremlin blogger with a booby-trapped statue smiling hours before she was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;killed by a bust of himself that detonated&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cafe on Sunday during an appearance in St Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931827" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/statue-assassin-killed-putin-blogger-807643593.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931827" width="960" height="488" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Daria Trepova can be seen smiling in the footage[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931828" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/statue-assassin-killed-putin-blogger-807643592.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931828" width="960" height="500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She was allegedly seen on the run hours after the blast[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21926342" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21926342" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, unknowingly enabled his own assassination[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;He was reportedly handed the deadly gold-coloured figurine by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/amp/"&gt;alleged anti-Putin bomber&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Darya Tryopova, 26,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/amp/"&gt;who was arrested today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;released a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21931448/assassin-bombed-putin-blogger-interrogated-radiator/"&gt;supposed confession video&lt;/a&gt; showing the blonde, with cropped hair, admitting her role in the bomb plot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, footage released by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation shows the moment Tryopova entered an apartment building with a large suitcase and shoulder bag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She can be seen smiling as a man opens a door for her, before the video cuts to show her arrest by Russian police.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops said she travelled around the city by taxi for four hours before arriving at the apartment block, Russian media reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local newspaper Izvestia claims that Tryopova bought a ticket from Pulkovo airport &amp;#8211; but never arrived for her flight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; released a supposed confession video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to explain why she is being detained, Tryopova says: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d put it this way, for being at the assassination side of Vladlen Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I brought there the statuette that exploded.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was then pressed to reveal who supplied her with the devastating explosive, to which she replied: &amp;#8220;Can I tell you later?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is alleged to have posed as an admirer while attending the creative event, while carrying the explosive in a cardboard box.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCTV footage captured a suspect strolling past the café clutching the package, before entering the venue owned by mercenary warlord &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the brutal &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/"&gt;Wagner Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a cruel twist of fate, eyewitnesses claim Tatarsky effectively &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21925611/putin-blogger-signed-own-death-warrant-blown-up-statue/"&gt;signed his own death warrant&lt;/a&gt; by welcoming Tryopova and her lethal gift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security at the café had questioned the blonde upon her arrival and told her to leave the box at the door after they asked: &amp;#8220;What if it&amp;#8217;s a bomb?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is alleged to have described herself as an &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221; and explained she &amp;#8220;wanted to show the heroes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s special military operation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is claimed that she struck up a conversation with the popular blogger before retrieving the package from a coat cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One attendee claimed the suspect had used the fake name Nastya to get close to Tatarsky before handing him the TNT-laced statue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video captured the moment she handed the box to Tatarsky, who held it approvingly before placing it down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa Smotrova said the pro-Kremlin pundit had insisted on seeing the bust, despite concerns from security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discussing the encounter she claims to have witnessed, she told&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://kp.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KP.ru&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that Tatarsky had asked his alleged killer&amp;#8217;s name during the seminar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa explained: &amp;#8220;She said: ‘Nastya. I want to give you a sculpture because I study at the sculpture department at the Academy of Art.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He said: ‘Well, fetch it.’ She said: ‘They told me at the entrance, &amp;#8216;What if it&amp;#8217;s a bomb? So I left it there’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Well, everyone here laughed. She said: ‘Well, shall I bring it?’ He said: ‘Yes, bring it’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She came, brought this box and went to the stage. She gave it to him.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bystander claimed that Tryopova then became reluctant to engage with him and sit closer after he invited her to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa continued: &amp;#8220;She says: ‘Oh, I&amp;#8217;m so shy’. He said: ‘Sit closer’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;She sat closer to the window, and said: ‘Well, I&amp;#8217;m here on the chair’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They took out the sculpture, it&amp;#8217;s a golden head in a helmet. Well, I don&amp;#8217;t even know if it looks like Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He put it down there without a second thought and then continued asking questions [to his seminar audience].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And suddenly an explosion and smoke… We were sitting in the second part of the hall. Everyone ran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Those nearby, of course, were already covered in blood and ran away. The windows exploded too. We ran to the exit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just three minutes after the exchange, Tatarsky was dead after the statue that contained up to 450 grams of TNT erupted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police told RBC media that “the explosion was at a height of 60 centimetres from the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its capacity was 300 to 450 grams of TNT and it went off &amp;#8220;to the right of Tatarsky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is said to have fled the scene and was reportedly booked on a flight from Pulkovo&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/airports/"&gt;Airport&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;hours later &amp;#8211; but never showed up for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A fireball explosion tore through the café, injuring 30 and sending shards of glass blasting into the street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage of the aftermath shows people attending to bleeding victims outside the façade of the collapsed café.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State media said 19 of the 30 caught in the St Petersburg blast were taken to hospital. Eight people remain in a serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova was busted at a rented flat close to the scene on Monday by the FSB and Investigative Committee, according to local media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she was led away in handcuffs from the residential complex, she reportedly said: &amp;#8220;I was set up. I was just being used.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first picture of Tryopova after her arrest showed her with cropped blond hair, suggesting she had cut it to disguise herself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are still hunting her alleged&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;-born accomplice Maria Yarun, 40, although&amp;nbsp;some reports say she is in hospital after the blast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials are now said to be scouring through Tryopova&amp;#8217;s conversations in a private web chat, according to&amp;nbsp;Telegram channel VCK-OGPU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The messages reportedly suggested she had come to St Petersburg from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;late last week and intended to fly abroad &amp;#8211; to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former shop worker had breakfast with her friend on Sunday and sent her a message following the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova wrote: &amp;#8220;I could have died there, I&amp;#8217;d rather have died there, I was set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is then alleged to have changed the settings on her messenger account for the first time in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova&amp;#8217;s boyfriend Dmitry Rylov &amp;#8211; also in his 20s and a member of the so-called Russian Liberation Army &amp;#8211; insists she has been &amp;#8220;set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also wanted by the secret services and has previously been detained at anti-war protests with his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rylov insisted Tryopova must have &amp;#8220;completely misunderstood the purpose&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;of the statue given to Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I believe that my wife was set up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am in full confidence that she would never be able to do something like that on her own volition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes, with Daria we really do not support the war in Ukraine, but we believe that such actions are unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am 100 percent sure that she would never have agreed to such a thing if she had known.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, is one of Russia&amp;#8217;s foremost military bloggers and has over 560,000 followers on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He provided a critical running commentary on Russia&amp;#8217;s war in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and had once been a fighter in the battles in eastern Ukraine in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with other Putin pundits, he criticised the Russian army for failing to fight even more brutally and ruthlessly against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE alleged assassin responsible for blowing up a Russian propagandist was captured being interrogated while chained to a radiator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daria Trepova, 26, has been accused of handing over the TNT-laden statue &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;that killed Vladlen Tatarsky, &lt;/a&gt;40, in St Petersburg on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931863" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 622px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000807644334.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=612" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931863" width="612" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The chilling image of the alleged assassin, Daria Trepova, chained up[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931725" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/real-name-maxim-fomin-killed-807564142.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931725" width="960" height="520" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Trepova was filmed allegedly admitted to her role in blowing up the Kremlin TV pundit[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931743" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497194-3.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931743" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;A woman believed to be Trepova is seen handing over the gold statue[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931849" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 874px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/647784f5-c605-4e42-aec2-6459dd0eeab7.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=864" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931849" width="864" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The possible suspect, Trepova, is believed to be from St Petersburg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931810" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-russian-news-agencies-reported-807368698.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931810" width="960" height="717" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Avalon.red&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The victim, Vladlen Tatarsky, was a military blogger and aggressively anti-Ukraine[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Chilling pictures have emerged of the female suspect sitting on the floor while bound to a radiator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russian interrogators have demanded she answer questions about her role in the violent killing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The explosive blast on Sunday night tore right through the café where the bile-monger Tatarsky was holding an event for 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was killed instantly and 30 others were injured before running from the blown-out café covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The military blogger was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21925611/putin-blogger-signed-own-death-warrant-blown-up-statue/"&gt;mysteriously presented with a gold-coloured figurine of himself by a woman&lt;/a&gt; moments before the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCTV caught the same woman strolling past the café with a mysterious box in hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She then enters the event at a venue owned by mercenary warlord Yevgeny&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the brutal&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/"&gt;Wagner Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman, believed to be Daria Trepova from St Petersburg, has previously been detained for taking part in anti-war rallies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was arrested on Monday at a flat close to the scene. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she was led away in handcuffs from the residential complex, she reportedly said: &amp;#8220;I was set up. I was just being used.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia has since released a supposed confession video with the now-cropped blonde admitting to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigators ask why she was detained and she replied: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d put it this way, for being at the assassination side of Vladlen Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I brought there the statuette that exploded.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pressed to reveal who gave her the devastating explosive, she replied: &amp;#8220;Can I tell you later?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are still hunting for her alleged&amp;nbsp;Ukrainian-born accomplice Maria Yarun, 40, although&amp;nbsp;some reports say she is in hospital after the blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_21931741" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497164-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931741" width="960" height="590" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The suspect is seen carrying the large box &amp;#8211; believed to contain the TNT-laden bomb &amp;#8211; to the event[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931809" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 896px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807524039.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=886" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931809" width="886" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The bombed-out café where Tatarsky was leading a discussion of 100 people[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21931814" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-tore-cafe-russian-807349367-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21931814" width="960" height="638" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Scenes from the aftermath of the explosion showed glass shattered over the street next to the collapsed façade of the café in central St Petersburg[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Trepova&amp;#8217;s boyfriend Dmitry Rylov &amp;#8211; also in his 20s and a member of the so-called Russian Liberation Army &amp;#8211; said she was &amp;#8220;set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also wanted by the secret services and has been detained at anti-war protests with his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rylov insisted Trepova must have &amp;#8220;completely misunderstood the purpose&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;of the statue given to Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I believe that my wife was set up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am in full confidence that she would never be able to do something like that on her own volition.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He continued: &amp;#8220;Yes, with Daria we really do not support the war in Ukraine, but we believe that such actions are unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am 100 percent sure that she would never have agreed to such a thing if she had known.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the event, eyewitnesses report seeing the woman handing the lethal gift to Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She allegedly called herself an &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221; and explained she &amp;#8220;wanted to show the heroes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s special military operation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is understood to have retrieved the box from a coat cupboard before telling the pro-&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;blogger: &amp;#8220;It’s not easy. That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve only made your bust so far.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage from the event confirms that a woman believed to be Tatarsky then holds the package approvingly and places the statue filled with around 400g of TNT next to him just seconds before it would end his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova is said to have fled the scene and was reportedly booked on a flight from Pulkovo&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/airports/"&gt;Airport&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;hours later &amp;#8211; but never showed up for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her flat was raided by cops and local media said her mother was arrested after the Russian Interior Ministry put her on the wanted list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials are now said to be scouring her conversations in a private web chat, according to&amp;nbsp;Telegram channel VCK-OGPU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The messages reportedly suggested she had come to St Petersburg from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;late last week and intended to fly abroad &amp;#8211; to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former shop worker had breakfast with her friend on Sunday and sent her a message following the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trepova wrote: &amp;#8220;I could have died there, I&amp;#8217;d rather have died there, I was set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;RUSSIA&amp;#8217;S FURY&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage of the aftermath shows glass shattered all over the street and people attending to bleeding victims outside the façade of the collapsed café.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city of St Petersburg is said to be reeling in shock from the attack on a busy street in Russia&amp;#8217;s second city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State media said 19 of the 30 people caught up in the blast were taken to hospital. Eight people remain in a serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wagner Group tyrant Yevgeny&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, was rumoured to be expected at the event, held at his café.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said of the blast: &amp;#8220;I have indeed passed the cafe to a patriotic movement called Cyber Front Z.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They were doing various seminars there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He compared Tatarsky&amp;#8217;s death to that of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19570577/darya-dugina-sanctioned-daughter-putins-spiritual-guide-car-bomb/"&gt;Darya Dugin&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Putin&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;spiritual mastermind&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18109464/putin-rasputin-inspired-ukraine-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexander Dugin&lt;/a&gt;, who was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19579295/vladimir-putin-alexander-dugin-car-bombing-assassination-russia-ukraine/"&gt;killed in a deadly car bomb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several hours before the explosion, Tatarsky had praised advertising hoardings in Moscow seeking recruits for Wagner fighters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;#8217;s nice to see such outdoor advertising,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some Russian outlets immediately blamed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the blast, but it is unclear if this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kremlin mouthpiece and political scientist Sergei Markov said: “Almost 100 per cent this terrorist attack was organised in Kyiv&amp;#8230; Like the terrorist attack against Darya Dugina.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claimed the purpose was &amp;#8220;to intimidate everyone who supports the armed liberation of Ukraine from the neo-Nazi terrorist regime”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Markov fumed: “Zelensky is personally responsible for this attack, being the public leader of the terrorist regime.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pro-Putin speaker of the Russian senate, Valentina Matviyenko, said:&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;Vladlen wrote the truth, he wrote simply, brightly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As a result he became a target for our enemies, who are afraid of the strength of our spirit, our people&amp;#8217;s will.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And Vladlen not only fought in the militia, collected help for our soldiers, but, most importantly, he formed the people&amp;#8217;s understanding of the special operation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And I&amp;#8217;m sure he did a lot for our future victory.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Head of the RT propaganda machine Margarita Simonyan said: &amp;#8220;Well, what? Will we forget? Forgive?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, is one of Russia&amp;#8217;s foremost military bloggers and has over 560,000 followers on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He provided a critical running commentary on Russia&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and was once a fighter in battles in eastern Ukraine in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with other Putin pundits, he criticised the Russian army for failing to fight even more brutally and ruthlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RUSSIA has vowed to ramp up it&amp;#8217;s forces on the Finnish border to &amp;#8220;liberate&amp;#8221; the Nordic country, which is set to join Nato today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The desperate claims come as Finland becomes the 31st member of the military alliance serving a heavy blow to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; as his troops continue to flounder on the battlefields of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929961" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/epa10550768-russian-president-vladimir-putin-806624346.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929961" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russia has vowed to ramp up its forces on the Finnish border[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929982" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-finland-full-fledged-member-807591320.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929982" width="960" height="574" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Finland is set to become a member of Nato today[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929994" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-meeting-board-ministry-defense-804870253.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929994" width="960" height="651" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has threatened to send troops close to Finland[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/kremlin/"&gt;Kremlin&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; grim message is in direct response to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/finland/"&gt;Finland&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;historic ascension to The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Nordic nation is the first to join its ranks since North Macedonia joined in 2020 and ends decades of the country&amp;#8217;s military non-alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The long awaited admission comes after both Finland and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sweden/"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; applied to join the alliance almost 12 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was hampered by a refusal to ratify the application by Hungary and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom&amp;nbsp;relented last week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland and Russia share a painful 810 mile border with one another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move will roughly double the West&amp;#8217;s transatlantic frontier facing &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in response, Russia has vowed to &amp;#8220;strengthen our military potential in the western and northwestern direction&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alexander Grushko, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, told state media Nato&amp;#8217;s expansion called for &amp;#8220;additional steps to reliably ensure Russia&amp;#8217;s military security.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mounting pressure from Nato became the main topic of Russia&amp;#8217;s TV program&amp;nbsp;60 Minutes and was lambasted by pundits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dmitry Abzalov said the situation involving Finland was a &amp;#8220;mess&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;already out of our hands&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olga Skabeyeva, Russia-1 host, went a step further and claimed the Finnish territory as &amp;#8220;our historical land&amp;#8221; and called for &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to take action over Finland&amp;#8217;s looming membership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;We have to liberate the brotherly Finnish people.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It follows last year&amp;#8217;s claims that the Kremlin would take &amp;#8220;adequate countermeasures&amp;#8221; and would send 12 units and divisions to its western military district. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the hostile warning, Finland is expected to join the alliance today &amp;#8211; which has been hailed by the Nato chief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4425500/nato-secretary-world-is-in-danger/"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt;, the secretary general of Nato, said it would make Finland safer and the collective alliance stronger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stoltenberg said: &amp;#8220;We will raise the Finnish flag for the first time here at NATO headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It will be a good day for Finland&amp;#8217;s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finland will become the sixth Nato nation to share a border with Russia, joining&amp;nbsp;Norway, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Finnish contribution  will add more than 257,000 troops to the combined forces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Turkey continues to block the ascension of Sweden to the alliance as talks between the two countries deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turkey&amp;#8217;s president Erdogan claims the country has not sufficiently sought to crackdown on Kurdish militant groups that his country recognises as terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All NATO members must unanimously agree before a country joins the block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929979" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/alexander-grushko-russian-ambassador-nato-807603800.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929979" width="960" height="629" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Getty&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg has praised the accension of Finland[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A COUPLE have slammed a restaurant in a popular tourist hotspot after they were charged £400 for missing their dinner booking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikToker&lt;/a&gt; @xchloe_henshawx recounted the outrageous moment her romantic date night on the streets of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/paris/"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/france/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, was ruined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929309" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/94abd50d-c656-41f4-b238-b8f506a7c18a.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929309" width="540" height="680" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The TikToker shows viewers the cancellation charge she received in an email&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok - @xchlo_henshawx&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929279" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 550px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000807599935.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929279" width="540" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok - @xchlo_henshawx&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The woman&amp;#8217;s boyfriend not looking too happy after hearing about the charge[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;In the clip, the woman explained she and her partner had accidentally fallen asleep and missed their reservation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the video continued, she showed the cancellation fee email the restaurant sent to her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The camera then zoomed out and her boyfriend appeared in the screen and looked disheartened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While he did have a beer, his facial expressions showed signs of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman said she reimbursed her partner with a &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; trade off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;When your boyfriend gets charged a 500 Euro (£440) cancellation fee for a restaurant because you fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So you buy him a drink.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think that is pretty fair.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video has more than 69,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other foodies were gobsmacked with the charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I would never sign such an agreement just saying,&amp;#8221; a TikTok user said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;OMG&amp;#8230; been to Paris for years and that&amp;#8217;s the first I&amp;#8217;ve heard of it,&amp;#8221; one added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s bulls**t,&amp;#8221; another remarked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, later in the comments the TikToker revealed they got their money back after raising concerns with the owner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another woman has hit back at a restaurant that charged her £500 for cancelling her booking &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21906062/charged-cancelling-restaurant-booking-two-days-notice/"&gt;despite giving two days&amp;#8217; notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A YOUNG Brit has died during gastric band surgery in Turkey as her devastated boyfriend payed tribute to his &amp;#8220;angel&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shannon Bowe, 28, from Falkirk in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/scotland/"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, passed away during the procedure on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21928725" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/br1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21928725" width="960" height="604" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Shannon Bowe, 28, died on Saturday during gastric band surgery[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21929326" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 499px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e32417b9-0801-422f-84d8-64495d2be5f1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=489" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21929326" width="489" height="897" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The young Scot&amp;#8217;s friends and family are &amp;#8216;devastated&amp;#8217; at their loss&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shannon, who lived in Denny, travelled to the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/"&gt;Middle Eastern country&lt;/a&gt; to undergo the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is unclear where she received the operation or what complications led to her death on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gastric band surgery is a&amp;nbsp;weight loss&amp;nbsp;procedure in which a band is placed around the stomach to&amp;nbsp;decrease food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surgery itself is expected to last less than an hour, but the whole procedure &amp;#8211; from anaesthesia to the patient waking up &amp;#8211; should take between three to four hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NHS reports that only 1 in 100 patients suffer complications during gastric band surgery, while less than 1 in 1,000 are likely not to survive the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her boyfriend Ross Stirling posted a devastating tribute online that read: &amp;#8220;Sleep tight my angel, love you forever and always.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pal of Shannon&amp;#8217;s said: “Everyone is totally devastated. Shannon was one of the kindest people I knew and she would do anything for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She was the life and soul of a party. It is so sad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These operations obviously are risky, but it is so rare you hear of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is finding it really hard to believe she is no longer with us.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The friend also revealed the complications her family are now facing because the young Scot did not have travel insurance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her family are now going to have to pay thousands of pounds to bring her back home,&amp;#8221; they added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the last thing they need to worry about.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the UK&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: &amp;nbsp;“We are supporting the family of a British national who died in Turkey and are in contact with the local authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving tributes are pouring in online from the 28-year-old&amp;#8217;s heartbroken loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One friend wrote:  “Sad to see the news of Shannon Bowe thoughts with all friends and family.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone else posted: “No words, absolutely devastated. Life is so cruel. You will be forever in our hearts Shannon Bowe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another added: “My heart is so sad Shannon. You were one of the purest most kindest souls I’ve ever met!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So grateful for the memories with you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another pal said: &amp;#8220;You always had the brightest spirit be it in the pub or when I saw you at work your smile was infectious and lit up even the darkest of days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Echoing the words of Shannon&amp;#8217;s boyfriend, she added: &amp;#8220;Rest easy now Angel you have gained your wings.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another tribute read: &amp;#8220;I just don&amp;#8217;t know how to accept what&amp;#8217;s happened and words can&amp;#8217;t describe how I&amp;#8217;m feeling. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s so cruel. My heart is sore for you and everyone that loved you. We have had some of the best memories and you really did make everyone laugh with your ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You were taken in such an unfair way and I&amp;#8217;m so sorry Shannon Bowe.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A BRIT died after he was reportedly electrocuted as he grabbed a live wire while taking a photo on holiday in India.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ivan Brown, 71, was in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, when the tragedy unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21928217" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2014-according-newspaper-hindustan-times-807598966.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21928217" width="960" height="661" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;SWNS&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Former pub landlord Ivan Brown died after being electrocuted on holiday in India[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;According to reports, the man was believed to be near a construction site where he was taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former pub landlord then grabbed a live wire when he lost his balance and was electrocuted to death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His family told ITV News Anglia they were still coming to terms with the loss of Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They said: &amp;#8220;We are just all absolutely distraught and heartbroken that we have lost the heart and soul of our family.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The long-time landlord of Murderers Pub was travelling through &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/india/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; with a friend as part of a two-month trip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The duo had been in Dalhousie town in the Chamba district, having arrived in a nearby village last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They had planned to leave for Dharamshala city today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hemant Thakur, deputy superintendent of Dalhousie police, claimed the Norwich man had climbed onto the roof of an under-construction building to take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thakur said Ivan then went too close to a transmission line and came into contact with a live wire and died instantly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tributes poured in for Ivan, who has been remembered as a community stalwart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally born in Costessey, his family moved to Lenwade when he was 11 and he went to Reepham Secondary Modern School.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After leaving school he worked a variety of jobs &amp;#8211; as a concrete inspector, draughtsman and salesman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually in 1984,  he bought The Murderers and Gardeners Arms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Ivan celebrated 30 years of being behind the bar at the Norwich pub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A PRO-Russian propagandist unknowingly enabled his own alleged assassination before being blown up by a TNT-laden statue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21916323/vladlen-tatarsky-cafe-bombing-explosive/"&gt;killed by a bust of himself that detonated&lt;/a&gt; in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cafe on Sunday during an appearance in St Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21926342" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-explosion-cafe-russias-second-807532140-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21926342" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Vladlen Tatarsky, 40, unknowingly enabled his own assassination[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21926366" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 765px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-807497109-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=755" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21926366" width="755" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Darya Tryopova, 26, admitted she brought him the statue in a confession vid released by Russian authorities[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21926361" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/suspect-daria-trepova-26-filmed-807497194-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21926361" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;East2West&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The pro-Putin blogger is said to have asked the blonde to sit closer to him at the event[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21926355" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-according-russias-ministry-internal-807361107-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21926355" width="960" height="643" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;EPA&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The cafe was destroyed and 30 were injured in the horror explosion on Sunday[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;He was reportedly handed the deadly gold-coloured figurine by &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/amp/"&gt;alleged anti-Putin bomber&lt;/a&gt; Darya Tryopova, 26, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21920465/anti-putin-bombers-accused-killing-russian-blogger/amp/"&gt;who was arrested today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; released a supposed confession video showing the blonde, with cropped hair, admitting her role in the bomb plot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to explain why she is being detained, Tryopova says: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d put it this way, for being at the assassination side of Vladlen Tatarsky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I brought there the statuette that exploded.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was then pressed to reveal who supplied her with the devastating explosive, to which she replied: &amp;#8220;Can I tell you later?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is alleged to have posed as an admirer while attending the creative event, while carrying the explosive in a cardboard box. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CCTV footage captured the suspect strolling past the cafe clutching the package, before entering the venue owned by mercenary warlord &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21036552/how-russian-warlord-yevgeny-prigozhin-went-from-hot-dog-cook-to-billonaire-with-private-army-who-could-replace-mad-vlad/"&gt;Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the brutal&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wagner-group/"&gt;Wagner Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a cruel twist of fate, eyewitnesses claim Tatarsky effectively signed his own death warrant by welcoming Tryopova and her lethal gift. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security at the cafe had questioned the blonde upon her arrival and told her to leave the box at the door after they asked: &amp;#8220;What if it&amp;#8217;s a bomb?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is alleged to have described herself as an &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221; and explained she &amp;#8220;wanted to show the heroes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ukraine-war/"&gt;Putin&amp;#8217;s special military operation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is claimed that she struck up a conversation with the popular blogger before retrieving the package from a coat cupboard. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One attendee claimed the suspect had used the fake name Nastya to get close to Tatarsky before handing him the TNT-laced statue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video captured the moment she handed the box to Tatarsky, who held it approvingly before placing it down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa Smotrova said the pro-Kremlin pundit had insisted on seeing the bust, despite concerns from security. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discussing the encounter she claims to have witnessed, she told &lt;a href="http://kp.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KP.ru&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that Tatarsky had asked his alleged killer&amp;#8217;s name during the seminar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa explained: &amp;#8220;She said: ‘Nastya. I want to give you a sculpture because I study at the sculpture department at the Academy of Art.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He said: ‘Well, fetch it.’ She said: ‘They told me at the entrance, &amp;#8216;What if it&amp;#8217;s a bomb? So I left it there’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Well, everyone here laughed. She said: ‘Well, shall I bring it?’ He said: ‘Yes, bring it’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She came, brought this box and went to the stage. She gave it to him.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bystander claimed that Tryopova then became reluctant to engage with him and sit closer after he invited her to. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alisa continued: &amp;#8220;She says: ‘Oh, I&amp;#8217;m so shy’. He said: ‘Sit closer’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;She sat closer to the window, and said: ‘Well, I&amp;#8217;m here on the chair’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They took out the sculpture, it&amp;#8217;s a golden head in a helmet. Well, I don&amp;#8217;t even know if it looks like Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He put it down there without a second thought and then continued asking questions [to his seminar audience].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And suddenly an explosion and smoke… We were sitting in the second part of the hall. Everyone ran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Those nearby, of course, were already covered in blood and ran away. The windows exploded too. We ran to the exit.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just three minutes after the exchange, Tatarsky was dead after the statue that contained up to 450 grams of TNT erupted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police told RBC media that “the explosion was at a height of 60 centimetres from the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its capacity was 300 to 450 grams of TNT and it went off &amp;#8220;to the right of Tatarsky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova is said to have fled the scene and was reportedly booked on a flight from Pulkovo&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/airports/"&gt;Airport&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;hours later &amp;#8211; but never showed up for it.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;!--googleoff: all--&gt;
	&lt;blockquote class="article__quote"&gt;
		&lt;div class="article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I was set up. I was just being used&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color"&gt;
					&lt;span class="quote-credit"&gt;Darya Tryopova&lt;/span&gt;				&lt;/cite&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;!--googleon: all--&gt;
	



&lt;p&gt;A fireball explosion tore through the cafe, injuring 30 and sending shards of glass blasting into the street.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Footage of the aftermath people attending to bleeding victims outside the façade of the collapsed café.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State media said 19 of the 30 caught in the St Petersburg blast were taken to hospital. Eight people remain in a serious condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova was busted at a rented flat close to the scene on Monday by the FSB and Investigative Committee, according to local media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she was led away in handcuffs from the residential complex, she reportedly said: &amp;#8220;I was set up. I was just being used.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first picture of Tryopova after her arrest showed her with cropped blond hair, suggesting she had cut it to disguise herself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cops are still hunting her alleged&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;-born accomplice Maria Yarun, 40, although&amp;nbsp;some reports say she is in hospital after the blast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials are now said to be scouring through Tryopova&amp;#8217;s conversations in a private web chat, according to&amp;nbsp;Telegram channel VCK-OGPU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The messages reportedly suggested she had come to St Petersburg from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;late last week and intended to fly abroad &amp;#8211; to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/istanbul/"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former shop worker had breakfast with her friend on Sunday and sent her a message following the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova wrote: &amp;#8220;I could have died there, I&amp;#8217;d rather have died there, I was set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She is then alleged to have changed the settings on her messenger account for the first time in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tryopova&amp;#8217;s boyfriend Dmitry Rylov &amp;#8211; also in his 20s and a member of the so-called Russian Liberation Army &amp;#8211; insists she has been &amp;#8220;set up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also wanted by the secret services and has been detained at anti-war protests with his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rylov insisted Tryopova must have &amp;#8220;completely misunderstood the purpose&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;of the statue given to Tatarsky.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: &amp;#8220;I believe that my wife was set up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am in full confidence that she would never be able to do something like that on her own volition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes, with Daria we really do not support the war in Ukraine, but we believe that such actions are unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am 100 percent sure that she would never have agreed to such a thing if she had known.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, is one of Russia&amp;#8217;s foremost military bloggers and has over 560,000 followers on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He provided a critical running commentary on Russia&amp;#8217;s war in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine &lt;/a&gt;and had once been a fighter in the battles in eastern Ukraine in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with other Putin pundits, he criticised the Russian army for failing to fight even more brutally and ruthlessly against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;VLADIMIR Putin&amp;#8217;s health has &amp;#8220;worsened&amp;#8221; and he isn&amp;#8217;t eating as he suffers crippling stomach pains, it has been claimed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tyrant, 70, is rumoured to be battling several health issues &amp;#8211; with speculation fuelled by his often &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17844487/five-clues-bloated-unhinged-putin-seriously-ill/"&gt;bloated look&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/"&gt;twitching feet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925887" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-listens-807576707.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925887" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Putin is claimed to have suffered a health setback over the weekend[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925863" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/russian-president-vladimir-putin-attends-807575662.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925863" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He held onto a table as he held a meeting today[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20160557/putin-parkinsons-pancreatic-cancer-russian-insider-reveals/"&gt;Bombshell spy documents leaked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to The Sun meanwhile previously appeared to confirm the dictator has pancreatic cancer and early-stage&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21429693/putin-feet-twitch-uncontrollably-parkinsons/"&gt;Parkinson&amp;#8217;s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has now been claimed the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; leader has suffered a setback in his health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telegram channel General SVR&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; which claims to be fed information by a Kremlin insider &amp;#8211; has been pumping out unverified information since the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The channel today claimed: &amp;#8220;Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s health worsened. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He practically ate nothing and periodically complained of pain in the abdomen, coming bouts of nausea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;After taking the medicine, for a while, the symptoms disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Putin, although he spends time at the residence on weekends, is almost constantly in bunker-type premises, fearing possible air strikes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The despot today look puffy-faced as he held a meeting with Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He could be seen fidgeting before clinging to the table as they spoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political analyst Valery Solovey last week alleged &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21898070/putin-high-speed-treated-cancer-neurological-issues/"&gt;Putin is &amp;#8220;high on speed&amp;#8221; during key meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He claims the president is undergoing treatment for cancer and neurological issues from both Israeli and Chinese doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Solovey &amp;#8211; whose earlier claims about the Kremlin leader&amp;#8217;s poor&amp;nbsp;health&amp;nbsp;were denied &amp;#8211; claims the tyrant has resorted to &amp;#8220;very strong stimulants” amid significant weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, General SVR previously claimed fresh treatment Putin had started &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21450252/putin-health-relapse-lash-out-ukraine/"&gt;could make him lash out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was also reported the panicked dictator had &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21382442/putin-classifies-medical-files-cancer-battle/"&gt;dramatically classified bombshell data&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to prove he had been treated for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to a former CIA chief, Putin &amp;#8211; reported health problems aside &amp;#8211; is a dead man walking and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21882127/putin-dead-man-walking-killed-cia-chief/"&gt;could be killed to finally end the war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;James Olson, the spy agency&amp;#8217;s former chief of counterintelligence, said he believes the sharks are now circling for the tyrant back home in&amp;nbsp;Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olson told The Sun that&amp;nbsp;Putin&amp;nbsp;is now in a &amp;#8220;no win&amp;#8221; situation &amp;#8211; with the war either devolving into a grinding stalemate, or ending with Vlad&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said if Putin stays in power he will never give up the war &amp;#8211; and so the way to end it is for Vlad to be killed or ousted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olson, who served for over 30 years in the CIA and won medals for his service, explained that things don&amp;#8217;t look good for Putin &amp;#8211; with either his oligarch pals, his military, or even his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21444569/putin-new-soviet-union-coup/"&gt;people set to turn on him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putin has lost more than 170,000 soldiers, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, since the start of the conflict as his war machine continues to grind forward at a slow pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21882127/putin-dead-man-walking-killed-cia-chief/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A BUSTY female carpenter who does her woodwork in a bikini says blokes love to watch her work for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/influencers/"&gt;influencer&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by HardWoodBunny, leaves little to the imagination when she is grafting in sweltering temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925260" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 780px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wood-believe-im-busty-female-807579072.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=770" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925260" width="770" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram/ woodbunnyy&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;HardWoodBunny likes to do her handiwork in teeny bikinis &amp;#8211; driving blokes wild[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925257" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 589px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wood-believe-im-busty-female-807579077.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=579" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925257" width="579" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/W00dBunny&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;She regularly shares videos of her working in risque outfits on social media[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;She is keen to break the mould of the male-dominated industry by bringing a fun element to her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/jobs/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; and flaunting her figure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The s&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/"&gt;ocial media&lt;/a&gt; star, from Houston, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/texas/"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, boasts almost 530,000 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers &amp;#8211; who can&amp;#8217;t get enough of watching her work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She runs a company called Stain and Ink, which specialises in &amp;#8220;creating functional works of art with locally sourced hardwoods&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To promote her business, the blonde has adopted the persona of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21248955/female-carpenter-bikinis-furniture/"&gt;the &amp;#8220;Bikini Carpenter&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She regularly shares videos of her scantily clad in &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/style/"&gt;teeny bikinis&lt;/a&gt; while in her workshop, showing off her incredible creations to fans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her most recent post certainly sent pulses racing, as the sexy clip racked up nearly 27million views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HardWoodBunny filmed herself laying the framework for some outdoor decking in the sunshine while donning a sports bra and tight gym shorts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wielding a nail gun, she easily proves her skill set by expertly securing the wooden panels in place. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The talented woodworker was inundated with compliments about her ability as well as her appearance in the comment section. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One joked: &amp;#8220;Mine just broke need a quote ASAP thank you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second wrote: &amp;#8220;Not only a beautiful carpenter but also one of the most beautiful girls ever!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third added: &amp;#8220;You can work with our crew any day.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a fourth said: &amp;#8220;Nailed it!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HardWoodBunny is used to wowing people with her look, although some are keen to remind her of the health and safety risks while wearing skimpy outfits and operating heavy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some warned it was &amp;#8220;unprofessional and dangerous&amp;#8221; to be dressed in shorts and a crop top while working with tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the carpenter hit back at trolls who said she &amp;#8220;return to modelling&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I literally have a full time woodworking business,&amp;#8221; she replied. &amp;#8220;I own Stain and Ink and have built everything on there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We previously told how a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21031945/female-carpenter-construction-women-career/"&gt;female carpenter who works with an army of men told how she is bombarded with sexist questions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jessbessell/video/7096180732925627653?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Jess Bessell&lt;/a&gt; loves her job &amp;#8211; but is less keen on the old-fashioned questions she has to endure at her&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21000706/female-coal-miner-transformation-career-clothes-cosmetics/"&gt;workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common query she faces is if she is single, but the chipper said she is also regularly asked why she chose her career. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another female carpenter &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/21031945/female-carpenter-construction-women-career/"&gt;revealed the four annoying things that people say when they find out what she does for a living&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sarah has been in the industry for four years, but still can&amp;#8217;t escape the constant interrogations from people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She explained that male carpenters will assume that she needs help at work and will say to her: “I’ll pick this up for your sweetheart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as this, Sarah claimed that many men on-site will ask “whose wife is this?” when they see her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, she doesn&amp;#8217;t let the uncomfortable comments get her down, because they drive her to do better than blokes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925295" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 585px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/84a1e7bc-12a4-4cf1-bdcd-42f7b3aadf95.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=575" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925295" width="575" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The clip of her grafting in the sunshine racked up nearly 27million views&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/W00dBunny&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21925298" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 576px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/80615b8b-c33f-4efb-96cd-5ee28b509b54.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=566" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21925298" width="566" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The influencer is keen to prove women can succeed in the male-dominated industry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Tiktok/W00dBunny&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A LITTLE girl was rushed to hospital after being mauled by a dingo that held her underwater while swimming in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The horrific incident happened on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8896285/dingo-attack-fraser-island-australia-dad-saves-baby/"&gt;Fraser Island&lt;/a&gt;, off &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;east coast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21924220" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 509px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DINGO-1-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=499" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21924220" width="499" height="310" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The horrific incident happened on Fraser Island, Australia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The six-year-old was swimming in shallow water at Waddy Point Beach on the eastern side of the island when the animal attacked her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The girl was bitten on her head and suffered puncture wounds around her ear as well as minor cuts to her hands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rescue chopper carrying paramedics attended the scene shortly after at around 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was subsequently treated and flown to Hervey Bay Hospital in central &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/queensland/"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; where she remains in a stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is believed the wild dog was an untagged male &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13416246/a-dingo-ate-my-baby-meaning/"&gt;dingo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesman from Bundaberg RACQ LifeFlight Rescue Team said: &amp;#8220;The animal reportedly held her underwater for a few seconds before nearby family members were able to get the dingo off her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;She sustained multiple minor bites to her head and fingers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service is investigating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="this-is-a-developing-story"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS A DEVELOPING STORY&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AUSTRALIA&amp;#8217;s biggest porn star had dished the dirt on her bedroom antics and a bizarre fantasy about getting it on with aliens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21901159/porn-star-angela-white-nearly-dying-sex-scene/"&gt;Angela White&lt;/a&gt;, 38, is used to taking charge between the sheets with her fellow &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/porn-stars/"&gt;adult film stars&lt;/a&gt;, but admitted she now fancies an other-worldly fling. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21923196" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/porn-star-breaks-silence-monster-806356597-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21923196" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;INSTAGRAM&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Angela White revealed she would be open to having sex with an alien[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21923145" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/porn-star-breaks-silence-monster-806356758.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21923145" width="768" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;INSTAGRAM&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The Aussie porn star spilled her bedroom secrets on the Only Stans podcast[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21872654/porn-star-angela-white-breaks-silence-scene-brit-legend/"&gt;The X-rated model&lt;/a&gt; spilled the secrets of her &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sex/"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; life on the latest episode of the&amp;nbsp;Only Stans podcast with host Glenny Balls. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She boasted about a marathon six-hour session before the conversation took an unusual detour to discuss romping with extraterrestrials &amp;#8211; and being impregnated by one.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/19061643/angela-white-adult-star/"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; had plenty of wild stories to entertain her fans with and delved straight into the gory details on the racy podcast. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/porn/"&gt;porn&lt;/a&gt; star revealed that her longest-ever sex session spanned the same length as a flight from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sydney/"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/bali/"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The six hours of lovemaking weren&amp;#8217;t even filmed, but &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5772763/porn-star-angela-white-who-describes-herself-as-a-sexual-athlete-and-is-paid-up-to-1400-per-shoot-reveals-she-was-labelled-a-slut-at-14/"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; explained she had a blast &amp;#8220;fooling around&amp;#8221; with the mystery man. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;The longest I&amp;#8217;ve had sex for is like, six hours.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angela said they &amp;#8220;fooled around &amp;#8211; made out, cuddled&amp;#8221; and even stopped for the occasional bathroom break during the lengthy rendezvous. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After going the full nine yards with her human lovers, the adult performer confessed she is now willing to step into unknown territory to satisfy her needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she would be open to the possibility of having sex with an &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/aliens-ufos/"&gt;alien&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; although the idea of getting pregnant is a &amp;#8220;turn-off.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angela explained: &amp;#8220;The baby part, I’m no longer sexually turned on at that point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But the idea of like, if there were intelligent beings that could consent to sex. What would it be like to have&amp;nbsp;sex&amp;nbsp;with an alien?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m very curious about experiencing all things that I can in this life, so.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the no holds barred chat, she said &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s not a line that I draw&amp;#8221; in terms of sex-periences. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Aussie&lt;/a&gt; has already had her fair share of wacky adventures during her illustrious career &amp;#8211; including camming for identical twins. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angela told how she was performing for the two blokes separately without realising their likeness &amp;#8211; until one of them brought his brother in the room during an online chat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She continued: &amp;#8220;We had a situationship, it wasn’t just sex. He was a fan. OK, there was a timespan. We were really into each other and we were ongoing for a while, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then, eventually that all broke down and then – here’s the funny part of the story – I was camming with his identical brother at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They knew because at one point twin one was like &amp;#8216;I have a surprise for me&amp;#8217; and he brought twin two in and said &amp;#8216;come in here&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was like [shocked].&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The porn star also took the opportunity to clarify rumours surrounding another sticky situation she found herself in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/porn/"&gt;sex industry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;veteran&amp;nbsp;Kieran Lee &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21344487/porn-star-angela-white-nearly-died-sex-keiran-lee/"&gt;claimed to have &amp;#8220;almost killed&amp;#8221; Angela&lt;/a&gt; while they were filming an hour-long sex scene. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10085325/porn-brazzers-troll-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-seth-rollins/"&gt;Brazzers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;performer and director, who has his nine-and-a-half-inch penis insured for $1million,&amp;nbsp;said she was rushed to hospital with a burst &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/3752629/appendicitis-symptoms-causes-treatment/"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after their tryst. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Angela said the incident had been &amp;#8220;blown way out of proportion&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;My appendix actually did not burst, but it is true I had appendicitis and did have to have emergency surgery to have it removed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A MAN was left stunned after a free &amp;#8220;dog toy&amp;#8221; on the beach turned out to be hiding a killer creature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse Donnison had taken his pet &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dogs/"&gt;pooch&lt;/a&gt; on a walk in Blackwattle Bay, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, when he noticed something floating in the water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21923218" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 424px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3961b4ab-b519-4426-9032-fb92a4134226.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=414" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21923218" width="414" height="714" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The dog-dad was shocked when he found a deadly octopus hiding in a ball&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;NCA NewsWire&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21923038" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 454px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/456628e6-8fd0-4a0d-9024-fa9428a3c17b.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=444" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21923038" width="444" height="395" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;he sea creature hold enough venom to kill 26 adult humans&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;NCA NewsWire&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog-dad thought he lucked out by stumbling across an expensive dog toy, but that wasn&amp;#8217;t the only surprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Jesse picked up the toy, he was &amp;#8220;freaked out&amp;#8221; after a tentacle emerged from a hole in the ball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8220;I just thought it had algae or something like that on it but then a tentacle popped out,&amp;#8221; he told NCA NewsWire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The horrified man instantly dropped the ball but was left scrambling after his dog, Otto, when he started chasing the toy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As soon as that tentacle came out, I knew there was only one creature it could be,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I dropped it pretty quickly, more than anything I was worried about the dog. Otto tried to get onto the ball immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Lucky I even looked and didn&amp;#8217;t just chuck it for the dog to go and grab.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The creature lurking in the toy was a blue-ringed octopus &amp;#8211; one of the most deadly sea creatures in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They carry enough venom to kill 26 adult humans in just minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the marine animal is tiny in size, their bites inject venom deep into the victim&amp;#8217;s bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can cause respiratory arrest, heart failure, paralysis, blindness and eventually death from suffocation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though they are venomous, the blue-ringed octopus is a relatively docile creature and only pose a risk to humans if they feel they are being threatened. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The octopus is usually active at night and spends most the day hidden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse explained the octopus initially had a green seaweed colour but the more it moved, the clearer its blue rings began to show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This sea creature typically has blue rings on its yellow body, but the rings only appear when the animal is disturbed, hunting or mating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I wasn&amp;#8217;t so much scared as I was startled. I was expecting seaweed, so it was a bit of a surprise,&amp;#8221; Jesse said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/7643737/woman-bitten-deadly-octopus-venom/"&gt;one woman was rushed to hospital after being bitten by one of these deadly octopuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The swimmer, in her 30s, was in the water at Chinaman&amp;#8217;s Beach in Sydney, Australia, when she picked up a shell the rare beast was hiding in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lethal animal bit her twice in the stomach but she miraculously survived the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9499787/brit-backpackers-risk-lives-blue-ringed-poisonous-touch-skin/"&gt;Brit backpacker risked his life after letting a blue-ringed octopus touch his skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ross Saunders claimed he didn&amp;#8217;t realise that he had caught the &amp;#8220;dangerous&amp;#8221; animal at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21923043" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 432px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/79b493d4-2fff-479f-8ffa-abc856897653.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=422" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21923043" width="422" height="416" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jesse was terrified when his dog started chasing the lethal animal&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;NCA NewsWire&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ANDREW Tate has shared a cryptic post claiming he could be killed in a bid to &amp;#8220;silence&amp;#8221; him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21403953/andrew-tates-pal-obsessed-money-dark/"&gt;former kickboxer&lt;/a&gt;, 36, was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21904597/andrew-tate-smirks-released-from-prison-house-arrest/"&gt;released from the Romanian jail&lt;/a&gt; he had been held in for three months on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21921802" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 677px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dead-man-walking-andrew-tate-807523791.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=667" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21921802" width="667" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Cobratate/Twitter&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Andrew Tate claimed he believes he could be killed in his latest social media rant[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21922063" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/https-www-instagram-com-cobratate-751673057.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922063" width="960" height="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Instagram/@cobratate&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The controversial influencer went for the clean shaven look before his stint in jail[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;But he has &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21905806/andrew-tate-jail-release-video/"&gt;placed under house arrest&lt;/a&gt; as a probe into&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20949484/andrew-tate-trafficking-victim-promised-marriage-webcam/"&gt;human trafficking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and rape allegations continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since being released from the &amp;#8220;hellhole&amp;#8221; prison, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/andrew-tate/"&gt;Tate&lt;/a&gt; has shared a number of cryptic posts on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his latest rant on &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Tate claimed he believes he could be shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also shared a picture of himself with a thick, ungroomed beard &amp;#8211; different from the clean shaven look he sported before his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tate wrote: &amp;#8220;I prepare my body to absorb the brutal kinetics of piercing lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As all other silencing attempts fail, and stage 3 approaches &amp;#8211; I anticipate a bullet will be the chosen utensil of pacification.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the message, he shared a past tweet from mid-December that read: &amp;#8220;If they kill me I love you all.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tate and his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/tristan-tate/"&gt;brother Tristan&lt;/a&gt;, 34, have been placed under house arrest for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both men and their two alleged &amp;#8220;angels&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20916197/who-girls-arrested-with-andrew-tristan-tate/"&gt;Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; remain under investigation in a sex trafficking and organised crime probe by Romanian cops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tate and his brother returned to their lavish compound in Pipera, Voluntari, on the outskirts of Bucharest amid a media circus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have been ordered to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21120892/is-andrew-tate-still-prison/"&gt;stay in the buildings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where they live &amp;#8211; unless they have permission from the courts to leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After being released, Tate posted a clip of him shirtless pacing back and forth in his home while smoking a cigar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Absolute clarity of mind. Real thoughts. Real plans. Vivid pain.&amp;#8221; he said, in reference to his time behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in a cryptic message, he added: &amp;#8220;We must defeat Shaytan.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shaytan is an evil demonic spirit in Islam that tempts humans into sin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tate and his brother both deny all wrongdoing and no charges have yet been brought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Controversial &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/influencers/"&gt;influencer&lt;/a&gt; Tate built up an image that appealed to teenage boys &amp;#8211; creating an online empire that made him one of the most searched people on Google.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Masquerading as lifestyle advice, much of the content is considered highly sexist and is seen as promoting violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His influence has had a worrying spread amongst young men and boys, with one UK MP saying he is &amp;#8220;brainwashing&amp;#8221; children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tate initially gained fame after a short-lived appearance on Big Brother.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21922107" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-official-friday-said-tate-806927647-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922107" width="960" height="629" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Tate and his brother Tristan were released last Friday but have been put under house arrest[/caption]</content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[]]></description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE US has demanded the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich following his outrageous arrest in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Highly respected correspondent Gershkovich, 31, was &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21882048/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-arrest-russia/"&gt;detained last week on suspicion of spying.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21921509" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-called-russia-release-wall-807096894.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21921509" width="960" height="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AFP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Evan Gershkovich has worked in Russia for six years[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21921595" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 576px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/reporter-u-s-newspaper-wall-806611887-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=566" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21921595" width="566" height="855" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Reuters&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The 31-year-old is being held by Putin&amp;#8217;s FSB security service following his arrest[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21921510" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-secretary-state-antony-blinken-807329700.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21921510" width="960" height="640" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;AP&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;He was seen being led into a car outside a court in Moscow[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;He has been accused of espionage after covering&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/vladimir-putin/"&gt;Vladimir Putin&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;disastrous invasion of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and Russia&amp;#8217;s economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Putin&amp;#8217;s spies have offered no evidence to support the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the charges and published an article on how &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-cd03b0f3"&gt;the country he loved had turned against him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His arrest was also strongly condemned by journalists globally who have been showing their support with the hashtag #IStandWithEvan on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gershkovich was arrested in the remote city of Yekaterinburg and is being held by Putin&amp;#8217;s FSB security service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthony Blinken, US Secretary of State, has urged his &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; counterpart to let Gershkovich go in a rare phone call between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Blinken expressed &amp;#8220;great concern&amp;#8221; over Russia&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;unacceptable detention of a US ciyizen journalist&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Lavrov repeated Russia&amp;#8217;s outlandish claims that Gershkovich was &amp;#8220;caught red-handed attempting to obtain classified information&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Russia accused Gershkovich of trying to obtain military secrets about a factory on behalf of the US &amp;#8211; but it has not named the factory and it has not provided any evidence at all to back up its allegation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lavrov also told Blinken that Gershkovich&amp;#8217;s case will be handled by Russian courts and the US should try not to &amp;#8220;make a fuss&amp;#8221; or politicse the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden and organisations around the world have joined editors at the WSJ in rallying for Gershkovich&amp;#8217;s immediate release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gershkovich, described as a &amp;#8220;esteemed, principled journalist&amp;#8221;, is the first reporter for an American news outlet to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5815267/cold-war-definition-what-is-it-origins/"&gt;Cold War.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journalist was reportedly held at a restaurant and bundled into a car by plain-clothed officers with a sweater pulled over his head.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He later appeared in court in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://the-sun.com/where/moscow/"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, where he pleaded not guilty to espionage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gershkovich was seen being led into a van by guards from the Lefortovsky court in the Russian capital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gershkovich is a US citizen whose parents fled the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has lived in Moscow for six years working as a journalist and joined the WSJ in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WSJ Editor in Chief Emma Tucker described Gershkovich&amp;#8217;s arrest as &amp;#8220;completely unjust&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: &amp;#8220;Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in newsgathering. Any suggestions otherwise are false. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;His sole purpose in his work is to capture issues occurring around the world and to shed light on them so that the public can make informed decisions about how to navigate the future. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We continue to call for his immediate release. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The unjust arrest of one of our own sits heavy with all of us, and I know for many there are lingering questions about what the Russian government’s actions mean for freedom of the press in the region.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After relocating to Russia, Gershkovich won awards for his work at The Moscow Times before joining the Agence France-Presse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After joining WSJ early in 2022, he travelled to the Belarus-Ukraine border as Russia invaded Ukraine, making him the only US reporter who could see the first injured Russian forces being taken home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;SEVEN people have been killed after their cars went up in flames when a suspected drunk driver ploughed into them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police the motorist who caused the horror pile-up on a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/germany/"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; motorway did not have a licence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure id="attachment_21922244" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-shows-tragic-accident-undated-807556037-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922244" width="960" height="541" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Seven people have died in a motorway pile-up in Germany[/caption]



&lt;figure id="attachment_21922430" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-shows-tragic-accident-undated-807556156.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-21922430" width="960" height="537" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;figcredit&gt;Newsflash&lt;/figcredit&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Police are investigating the horror crash[/caption]



&lt;p&gt;Five 19-year-olds were travelling in a Mercedes on Saturday when a BMW trying to overtake another car drifted over to the wrong side of  the B247 motorway in the central state of Thuringia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All five, three men and two women, were killed after their car then caught on fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BMW is then understood to have hit a Volkswagen Caddy, causing it to also burst into flames and kill the 60-year-old driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 73-year-old passenger in the VW managed to pull themselves out of the burning car and survived, according to local media, while a 44-year-old passenger in the BMW also died in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police named the BMW driver only as 45-year-old Ronny L., due to strict local privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is in hospital with a second passenger from the car, aged 34, and both in serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authorities are investigating Ronny L. for negligent homicide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police spokeswoman Fraenze Toepfer said: &amp;#8220;We also suspect that the BMW driver was drunk and have ordered a blood test. The result is still pending.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The motorway was shut down after the accident, with investigators combing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts are also understood to be counselling shocked relatives of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thuringian Police said: &amp;#8220;Since it could not be ruled out that the 45-year-old BMW driver, who does not have a driving licence, had been drinking alcohol, a blood test was ordered.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Police have appealed for witnesses of the crash to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
