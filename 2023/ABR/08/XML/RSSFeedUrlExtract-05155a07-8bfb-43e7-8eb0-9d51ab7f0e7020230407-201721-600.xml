<h2><strong>Auditing &amp; Reporting </strong></h2>
<p>When making critical decisions about a business’s future direction or strategy, it’s essential for leaders and stakeholders alike to have easy access to detailed reports about past activities and performance metrics relevant to those decisions. An effective MDM solution should provide auditing capabilities such as tracking changes made by users over time and customizable reporting features allowing users to generate detailed reports quickly and easily using real-time data from their consolidated database.</p>
<h2><strong>Integration &amp; Automation </strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, one of the main benefits of an MDM solution is its ability to connect disparate systems into one cohesive platform. This integration allows for automation across multiple systems which helps streamline processes such as customer onboarding or daily operations while still ensuring accuracy due to built-in quality assurance tools in many modern MDM solutions.</p>
<h2><strong>Analytics &amp; Insights </strong></h2>
<p>One of the most powerful uses for an MDM solution is its ability to provide actionable insights into <a href="https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/consumer-behavior-in-marketing-patterns-types-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer behavior</a> or market trends through its analytics capabilities. By analyzing large amounts of disparate data from multiple sources in near real-time, a good MDM can help uncover hidden patterns which may otherwise go unnoticed by human eyes alone—allowing businesses more informed decision-making going forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Master Data Management is a potent tool for businesses of any size. It provides the ability to access accurate data from multiple sources quickly and efficiently, as well as ensuring that this data remains secure and compliant with applicable regulations. Additionally, its built-in analytics capabilities can provide valuable insights into customer behavior or market trends which would otherwise go unnoticed—allowing businesses to make informed decisions and stay ahead of the competition.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The importance of solid cybersecurity precautions has grown as technology has advanced and become more integrated into our daily lives. Cybercrime is rising as hackers find new ways to penetrate computer networks and systems. Individuals and businesses that want to stay ahead of the curve in cybersecurity should familiarize themselves with the most recent developments in the field. This article will look at 6 trends that have the potential to impact the future of cybersecurity. Don’t worry if you’ll find some words confusing &#8211; the cybersecurity field may have plenty of unknown and hard-to-understand terms! The <a href="https://nordvpn.com/cybersecurity/glossary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity dictionary</a> should always be used for this; it will be your best friend.</p>
<p><span id="more-197719"></span></p>
<h2>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword for a few years, but it&#8217;s only recently that we&#8217;ve started seeing its potential in cybersecurity. With AI, <a href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/data-privacy-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans may be unable to spot</a>. This can help us to detect and respond to cyber threats more quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Automation of specific processes is one way AI can strengthen security. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered security systems, for instance, can detect and respond to threats automatically, without human intervention. This can aid in speeding up the resolution of security incidents and decreasing response times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Growing Importance of Zero Trust Security</h2>
<p>The perimeter of a network has typically been the primary target of security efforts. However, as cloud computing and remote working continue to grow in popularity, this method will soon be left in the dust. Instead, the focus is shifting toward <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Trust security</a>.</p>
<p>A model of security known as &#8220;Zero Trust&#8221; considers all users and gadgets, both inside and outside the network, to be potential threats. As a result, regardless of their location or previous access, it constantly requires authentication and verification of all users and devices.</p>
<p>This approach provides a more granular level of security and can help prevent breaches from external and internal sources. With Zero Trust security, access is only granted on a need-to-know basis and is continuously monitored and updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Use of Blockchain Technology in Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Blockchain technology is best known for its use in cryptocurrencies, but it has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity as well. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that is highly resistant to tampering or modification. This makes it ideal for securing sensitive data and transactions.</p>
<p>One of the ways that blockchain can be used in cybersecurity is by providing a secure, tamper-proof record of all transactions within a network. This can help ensure that data is not modified or corrupted in transit and provide an audit trail for security incidents.</p>
<p>Another use of blockchain in cybersecurity is creating decentralized identity systems. Such systems allow users to maintain control over their data and identity rather than relying on centralized authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Growing Threat of Ransomware</h2>
<p>Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim&#8217;s files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. This attack has become increasingly common in recent years and is a growing threat to individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that ransomware has become so popular among cybercriminals is its relative simplicity. Ransomware attacks can be launched using off-the-shelf tools and techniques and can be highly profitable if the victim pays the ransom.</p>
<p>To combat the threat of ransomware, organizations need to implement robust backup and recovery strategies and effective security measures to prevent infection in the first place. Training employees to recognize and report suspicious activity is also essential, as human error is often a contributing factor in ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Impact of 5G on Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>5G is the next generation of mobile network technology, offering faster speeds and more excellent connectivity than its predecessors. While 5G has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, it also brings new cybersecurity challenges.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns with 5G is the increased attack surface it creates. With more devices connected to the network, cybercriminals can exploit more potential entry points. In addition, the higher speeds and lower latency of 5G could make it easier for hackers to launch large-scale attacks more quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Organizations need to ensure that their 5G networks are properly secured to mitigate these risks. This may involve implementing new security measures such as network slicing, which allows the creation of separate, isolated virtual networks within a single physical network. It&#8217;s also essential to ensure that all devices connected to the network are correctly secured and updated with the latest patches and security updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Continued Importance of Cloud Security</h2>
<p>As more organizations move their operations to the cloud, the need for effective cloud security measures becomes even more critical. Cloud providers have a shared responsibility model for security, meaning that while the provider is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, customers are responsible for ensuring their data and applications.</p>
<p>Organizations must implement various measures to ensure effective cloud security, including encryption, access control, and monitoring. They also need to ensure that they are aware of any potential vulnerabilities in their cloud environment and have the plan to respond to security incidents.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As organizations become more reliant on digital infrastructure, securing machine identity management becomes increasingly important. Traditional methods of managing metadata are no longer sufficient to ensure data security and privacy, which is why modern solutions like PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and DevOps technologies have become effective ways of enhancing metadata protection. By leveraging these innovative tools, organizations can benefit from improved authentication processes, better access control capabilities, increased scalability, and enhanced encryption protocols that provide more protection for their sensitive data. With PKI and DevOps technologies providing reliable, <a href="https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/machine-identity-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern solutions for machine identity management</a> in today’s digital world, companies can rest assured knowing that their valuable information is safe and secure.</p>
<p><span id="more-197535"></span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Public Key Infrastructure? </strong></h2>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a way for organizations to protect their data using encryption and digital signatures. A PKI system uses two different types of keys: a public key used to encrypt data and a private key used to decrypt it. The public key is publicly available, while the private key must remain secret for the system to work correctly. By using this system, organizations can ensure that only authorized individuals can access their data.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is DevOps?                         </strong><strong>                                                             </strong></h2>
<p>DevOps is an approach to software development that combines software engineering and operations practices into one unified process to improve efficiency and speed up delivery times. It relies on collaboration between developers and operations teams to streamline processes and ensure quality control throughout the entire development life cycle. This includes automating tasks such as testing, building applications, deploying code, provisioning infrastructure, monitoring systems, tracking changes, etc., to reduce the manual work needed during each stage of the application development process.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does DevOps Help Enhance PKI? </strong></h2>
<p>DevOps is an approach that combines software development and operations teams to create an integrated technology environment. This allows organizations to rapidly deploy and manage systems while ensuring quality control throughout the entire process. Regarding enhancing PKI security, DevOps provides several benefits, including automated deployment of certificates, version control of policies, faster response times for certificate requests, more efficient communication between teams, and better visibility into overall security status. These features mean that organizations can quickly identify potential threats before they become a problem and take steps towards mitigating them before they cause any damage.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using Both Technologies Together </strong></h2>
<p>When used together, PKI and DevOps provide organizations with enhanced metadata protection capabilities by creating an environment where all sensitive information can be securely stored and managed without compromising performance or availability. Organizations can also quickly identify potential vulnerabilities before they become significant security issues, which can save time and money in the long run.</p>
<p>Additionally, this <a href="https://www.wipro.com/blogs/wipro-insights/innovation-through-combination-of-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combination of technologies</a> helps reduce risk by assisting organizations to stay on top of their security posture through automated processes such as certificate renewals or policy updates, which can be done without intervening every time something needs changing or updating manually. Finally, using both technologies helps improve compliance efforts often required when dealing with sensitive customer data or financial transactions. By using both technologies, you can expect to have a more secure position, so get started today!</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure and DevOps are two powerful tools that can help organizations improve their security posture while enabling them to deliver applications faster. By combining PKI and DevOps technologies, companies can ensure that their data is secure while taking advantage of the many benefits of using both systems in tandem. Combining these two technologies helps improve security posture, reduce risk, and increase compliance with relevant regulations. These benefits make PKI and DevOps a powerful combination for any organization looking to protect its data.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With each passing day, our reliance on technology for almost every aspect of life increases. Unfortunately, cybercriminals have adapted and evolved with the times to capitalize on the vulnerabilities associated with our new digital lifestyles.</p>
<p>As a student, you’re especially vulnerable to the ever-evolving world of <a href="https://www.cyberdb.co/cybersecurity-new-methods-of-criminals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity attacks</a> because of your frequent use of email accounts, online banking systems, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore some common types of cyberattacks that target students specifically and present methods for staying safe online in today&#8217;s digital age.</p>
<p><span id="more-197476"></span></p>
<h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
<p>Phishing attacks are designed to look like legitimate messages from trusted organizations, making them difficult to recognize. Cybercriminals often use this technique to steal usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information which they can use for their financial gain. So, even when you choose a <a href="https://kingessays.com/thesis-writing-service.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thesis writing service</a>, you should be careful and trust only reliable sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious of emails from unknown senders, containing attachments or links.</li>
<li>Verify the legitimacy of any website the email directs you to visit by carefully inspecting the URL address.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the sender’s email address, as phishers often use misspelled variations of legitimate organizations&#8217; names to deceive recipients.</li>
<li>Check for spelling mistakes or other signs that this is not a genuine message, such as requests for confidential information.</li>
<li>If an email requests payment or asks you to update your account information online, it’s best to contact the organization directly rather than clicking on any links included in the email.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Malware</h2>
<p>There are a lot of types of malicious software that can steal data or affect computer performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Programs that appear to be legitimate, but are malicious code designed to steal data or compromise a system’s performance.</li>
<li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Programs that gather sensitive information on users, such as their browsing history and keystrokes, to gain access to confidential information.</li>
<li><strong>Backdoor Attacks:</strong> Remotely controlled programs that allow unauthorized entry into a user&#8217;s computer, allowing attackers to gain control over the system.</li>
<li><strong>Viruses and Worms:</strong> Programs that replicate themselves and spread across networks and computers, compromising data or system performance by taking up valuable processing time or memory space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
<p>Social engineering attacks are cybercrime that involves manipulating people, rather than attacking systems.</p>
<p>They often target students by using social engineering techniques such as phishing emails, malicious websites, and text messages to gather personal or financial information.</p>
<p>These types of attacks may also be used to spread malware and ransomware, disrupting computer systems for ransom payments. As such, students need to be aware of these threats and take measures to protect their data and devices from attack.</p>
<h2>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks</h2>
<p>These attacks are a type of cyberattack that involves flooding networks or servers with large amounts of data, resulting in an overload that can cause systems to crash.</p>
<p>This type of attack is most commonly used against students, as it can disrupt online activities like learning or communication.</p>
<p>DDoS attacks can be difficult to detect and may require help from security professionals to mitigate the damage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the attack is identified, it should be reported to authorities and adequate measures should be taken to protect against future attacks.</p>
<h2>Ransomware</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ransomware</a> is a type of malware that encrypts a user’s files and then requests payment to get the data back.</p>
<p>This type of attack particularly affects students as they are often unaware of the threat until it&#8217;s too late. Unfortunately, attackers may not always follow through with their promise to decrypt data even if the ransom was paid, which is why students need to back up their data regularly and use antivirus software to detect any potential ransomware threats.</p>
<p>Taking these measures can help minimize the effects of a ransomware attack if one were to occur.</p>
<h2>Password Reuse</h2>
<p>Password reuse is a major security risk for students, as attackers can use stolen or leaked passwords to gain unauthorized access to accounts.</p>
<p>It can be especially damaging for students, as any confidential data which may have been stored in their accounts can be compromised. It&#8217;s important for students to not only create unique passwords for each account but also to change them regularly to make it harder for attackers to access their accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, security experts from <a href="https://assignmentpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AssignmentPay</a> advise that two-factor authentication should be enabled when available, and caution should always be taken when dealing with emails or other links that could contain malicious software capable of stealing passwords.</p>
<h2>Cyberattacks on Students</h2>
<p>Our increasing reliance on technology has made students especially vulnerable to cybercrime activity.</p>
<p>Common attacks targeting students include phishing, malware, social engineering, DDoS, and ransomware.</p>
<p>To protect against such attacks, students should exercise caution with unknown emails and links, create unique passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication when available.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With each passing year, the cyber security threat landscape continues to diversify and worsen. This evolving landscape has led to a huge demand for IT security professionals, with nowhere near enough available contractors in the market to fill the </span><a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated 3.5 million vacancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the market will see by 2025, as estimated by (ISC)² in its most recent Cybersecurity Workforce Study. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-197323"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Moving from corporate to contract IT work</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has paid dividends for skilled IT technicians that want to move away from corporate infrastructure and delve into ?freelance terrain. The ever-growing demand for IT contractors means that many people with the right expertise, capabilities and qualifications can build a lucrative career fulfilling jobs on a contract basis. There are certainly plenty of personal and professional benefits that such a career move can bring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as with any startup contract-based business operation, there are going to be hurdles that you’ll stumble over along the way. Not only that, but there are essential security practices you should be cautious of when it comes to protecting your new business venture in order to avoid common mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you are considering embarking on an IT contract career, you should be mindful of some of these common pitfalls and obstacles, which this guide will highlight. Furthermore, there’ll also be guidance you can follow about avoiding these entirely, or at least minimizing their impact, so you’ll be best placed to start your IT contracting pursuits with confidence and optimism. Every project you fulfill will present a fair share of risks, ranging from safety and data protection issues to payment disputes and timescale challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being aware of the seven common mistakes is a crucial first step to avoiding them in the future.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Lacking industry knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With any contract work, it’s crucial to understand the niches of your services and the market(s) you’ll be operating in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT and tech encompasses a broad range of specialisms, including (but not limited to) consultancy, training, web development, tech support, hosting, among others. There are also further niches to consider, ranging from IoT, incident response and DevOps to social engineering, vulnerability management, data security, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a contractor, it’s vital that you pinpoint your chosen industries or sectors after thorough research. If you are aware of your industry’s up-to-date news, </span><a href="https://www.cyberdb.co/5-emerging-trends-and-technologies-in-software-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and developments &#8211; such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example &#8211; this, along with your key skills, will ensure you’re best prepared to tackle projects from clients in need.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Misjudging costs and capital</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up any freelance business requires a lot of projections for income, expenses, cash flow, and other finances. Quite often, these are misjudged, with contractors easily falling into the trap of spending more than they are earning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s vital to ensure you account for all your resources, including office space, equipment, insurance, taxes, inventory, website and marketing costs, utilities, software and tools, and so on. </span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Relying too much on certain clients</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are self-employed as an IT professional, you will encounter situations where prospective clients choose alternative solutions or competitors. This could be for various reasons, but often the reasons are outside of your control. Therefore, it’s wise to be prepared in case such a situation develops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, clients will come and go, but you should aim to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. As long as you can handle the workload, you can branch out to new clients and work on multiple projects. After a while, you may find yourself busy, so you may feel less stressed if a client decides to take business elsewhere.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Settling for lower rates</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors regularly make the mistake of not charging enough for their services. It’s essential to set the right price, whether it’s an hourly fee or a price per-project, because you want to avoid encountering a situation where the ends do not justify the means (i.e. overworking and undercharging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging less can sometimes be a good thing when you’re just starting out and need to build a foundation of reliable clients. However, this isn’t feasible or viable in the long-term. As you hone your craft and develop your skills, you can justify charging higher fees.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Not networking and marketing enough</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building long-term, mutually-beneficial relationships is vital to growing your business. Whether this is through LinkedIn, industry events, or attending structured networking meetings, you need to actively source those business opportunities. Referrals, recommendations and word-of-mouth go a long way when you’re just starting out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this, it’s vital that you get the vital components of your offline and digital marketing nailed down. Without these, how can any prospective client have any trust in your services? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you also set up a website and social media accounts to market yourself, and don’t forget about your essentials like branding and logos. If you plan to bid on projects using freelance sites, ensure your profile is professional and engaging. Remember business cards to hand out at networking events. Consistency is everything, and you may need some external guidance on how you construct these components. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that professionalism and online reputation can’t be overlooked these days. However, contrary to popular belief, you </span><a href="https://www.mpb.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t have to pay through the nose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create some professional images and photos which you can use across all your deliverables. </span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Accepting all projects</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be tempting to find clients as quickly as possible to kickstart your IT contract business. However, all clients are different and you will likely encounter ones you prefer working with, as well as those that you don’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By finding a specific type of client or project to target, you’ll avoid having to hastily and haphazardly apply for projects that don’t fill you with enthusiasm, or working with clients that don’t share the same ethos or values as you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By avoiding projects that aren’t suited to your skillset, and carefully selecting those that complement your expertise, you’ll build a portfolio of happy clients that respect and trust you. </span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Poor accounting and bookkeeping</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accurate bookkeeping and accounting can be a real challenge to get right. The best way to ensure you are above board and more tax-efficient is to invest in a dedicated professional accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be tempting to avoid delegating your tax and expense obligations to a third party, and save yourself some money in the process. However, as a company owner, you have several mandatory taxes and deadlines which many freelancers aren’t always aware of when they first branch out. If these aren’t met, you could be liable for penalties, which can have a knock-on effect and, if not addressed, could spell financial disaster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s in your best interests to hire a professional accountant and bookkeeper who can advise you on everything you need to know, and how you can retain as much cash as possible.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While other search engines are available, Google is the dominant force when it comes to internet enquiries. As of January 2023, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google accounted for 85% of all desktop searches</a>. By comparison, its nearest competitor, Bing, had a shade under 9%.</p>
<p>With the sheer volume of searches Google deals with, it’s easy to see why companies and brands are doing everything they can to appear as high up on the search engine’s results as possible – known as ranking. This is where search engine optimisation (SEO) experts come to the fore to help companies rank higher than their competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-197275"></span></p>
<p>It’s common practice for many companies to use an SEO or digital marketing agency for better online visibility but what happens to your Google ranking in the wake of a cybersecurity attack, and should you be concerned? Let’s find out.</p>
<h2>What is SEO?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, SEO is concerned with helping a company rank as highly as possible on the search results pages of search engines, with Google being the primary focus. It is commonly adopted as part of a digital marketing agency’s arsenal to help improve its clients&#8217; website ranking and visibility.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim is to increase traffic to a brand’s website, which in turn increases leads, conversions and enquiries. No one thing can improve SEO, it requires a holistic approach to digital marketing from link-building campaigns and conversion rate optimisation to web design, content creation and social media marketing.</p>
<h2>How a cybersecurity incident impacts Google rankings</h2>
<p>We know that a breach in your cyber defences is less than ideal, to say the least. But not only should you be worried about the legal and reputational implications of being hacked, and the potential loss of <a href="https://www.cyberdb.co/5-tips-to-minimize-enterprise-data-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitive client data</a>, you should also be concerned about your online ranking.</p>
<p>Naturally, you need to put out the biggest fires first, but failing to resolve your cybersecurity issues can have huge implications for your online ranking results. From undesirable warnings to users through to bad reviews and periods of inactivity, your ranking can be impacted from various angles.</p>
<h3><strong>Negative website reviews</strong></h3>
<p>Users who have a bad experience while using your website, or who may have been the victim of data theft due to your cybersecurity issues aren’t likely to leave a glowing review.</p>
<p>Rather, if they have had a negative experience then they will share those problems with the world through a negative review – which can be particularly detrimental to your ranking if left through Google’s review section. Sites that build up a collection of negative reviews can see their ranking impaired and this can sometimes take months to recover from, as the reviews linger around for all to see.</p>
<h2>Insecure connection or hacked site warnings</h2>
<p>If your site is suspected by Google to have been hacked or cannot create a secure connection between your domain and users, a warning message will appear in your search results.</p>
<p>Experts at <a href="https://artemis.marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artemis Marketing</a>, a leading SEO and digital marketing specialist say, “Google has confirmed that the message is now a ranking factor, so it can be losing you traffic in multiple ways”.</p>
<p>As for hacked sites, the SEO experts say, “we know that the behaviour of users affects search rankings – if your site is hacked and not being clicked, this indicates to Google that you are being ranked incorrectly and are a less useful result”.</p>
<h3><strong>Downtime can be a red flag</strong></h3>
<p>Websites can be out of action for a variety of reasons but typically they will be restored to working order swiftly by your IT and web development experts. If your site is down because it or your company as a whole has been hacked then the longer you are inactive the more you will find your ranking dips.</p>
<p>Now you need to spend the time figuring out how and why your site was attacked, while also removing the threat. This isn’t always something you can resolve in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The first few hours won’t have a huge impact on ranking as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s crawling bots</a> will note the error message displayed and try again later. But, when they try to crawl your website later and are met with the same error message your pages will start to be &#8216;deranked&#8217; as the time elapsed moves into days rather than hours.</p>
<h2>Sabotage from rivals</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why you should ensure that your cybersecurity is as robust as possible is due to the risk getting hacked has on your business success. Companies that suffer a data breach, must undertake the expenses of recovering the data if possible, safeguarding further losses, investigating the cause, plus dealing with the legal issues in the fallout.</p>
<p>It is not unknown for companies to sabotage their rivals by enforcing a tanking of their ranking either through hacking your site to slow it down or by spamming links to your site &#8211; which Google uses as a negative ranking factor. Maintaining and auditing your backlinks is key to <a href="https://blog.reputationx.com/guest/negative-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online reputation management</a> as is monitoring your site speed to look for signs of unwanted code.</p>
<h2>Preventative measures</h2>
<p>Of course, we are not completely useless when it comes to protecting our online search ranking and there are several preventative measures we can take.</p>
<h3><strong>Secure hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Your website needs a place to live, which is known as web hosting, but there are different levels of security when it comes to hosting.</p>
<p>These protection levels are often associated with cost as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-web-hosting-and-why-do-you-need-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby P. Jane writing for TechRadar</a> explains: “Free web hosts often don&#8217;t have the same level of security as paid hosts because they can&#8217;t afford to invest in it. Paid web hosts, on the other hand, usually have better security because they can afford to invest in it.”</p>
<p>A hosting provider with a good reputation for security can make the world of difference to how protected your site is and help keep your hard-earned SEO ranking intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Software management</strong></h3>
<p>It can be all too easy to ignore the requests from your device to install the latest software versions but do so at your peril. Often the reason new versions are implemented is to bolster security against <a href="https://www.cyberdb.co/7-cybersecurity-trends-to-monitor-in-2023-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerging threats</a>, so to run an outdated application or software version is to tempt fate regarding your cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Strong passwords</strong></h3>
<p>Strong passwords are fundamental to online security but often it’s at the human input stage <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-most-common-causes-of-data-breaches-and-how-you-can-spot-them">where data breaches occur and hackers gain entry</a>. Ensure strong password management throughout your organisation, such as multi-factor authentication and a password management tool to ensure that only a handful of people in your company have access to your master accounts and passwords.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naturally, you want everything to be done safely when eSports betting online. However, why is this safety so crucial, and how is it ensured? Learn more here on the value of cybersecurity for eSports betting sites.  As more nations adopt cutting-edge betting technologies, the sports betting business has experienced considerable growth. But despite the industry&#8217;s rich potential, this technological expansion also entails higher cybersecurity concerns. Did you know that the value of the cybercrime market is $4 billion and that hackable financial ventures like online gambling and banking make for simple targets? As a result, the industry places a high priority on cybersecurity.</p>
<p><span id="more-197270"></span></p>
<p>Using an insecure online betting platform puts your sensitive financial and personal information, such credit card and bank information, at risk. In order to alter the odds or outcomes of games, hackers may also target eSports betting, which can negatively impact the customer confidence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-197273 aligncenter" src="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport2-300x128.png" alt="" width="595" height="254" srcset="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport2-300x128.png 300w, https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport2.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>The potential for hacking is one of the biggest cybersecurity dangers in the online betting sector. Gambling platforms, databases, and money processing systems are all vulnerable to hacking attempts. Sensitive personal and financial data, including contact information, bank account information, and credit card numbers, may be stolen as a result of this. By installing strong cybersecurity protocols in the system, bookmakers can prevent theft of this critical user information.</p>
<p>Other significant cybersecurity concerns in this industry include malware and phishing attempts. Users may be duped by these assaults into downloading malicious software or divulging sensitive information using social engineering techniques. Bookmakers can defend their clients from these assaults and stop the theft of important data by putting in place strong cybersecurity protocols.</p>
<p>With the development of new technologies comes new threats as the sector expands. Working with trustworthy cybersecurity professionals and staying up to date on the most recent technical advancements in the cybersecurity business are prudent moves for a betting platform.</p>
<h2>The Choice of a Reliable eSports Bookmaker</h2>
<p>A bookmaker must, among other things, be 100% legal, operate efficiently, clearly present odds, efficiently update live bets and give you a sense of financial security. In order to regularly place bets and make a profit from this, you need to choose a good betting platform for eSports. Many beginners choose not the most reliable bookmakers due to the fact that they do not even bother to find out more information about them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-197272 aligncenter" src="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport3-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="374" srcset="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport3.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>They may come across fraudulent sites that may pretend to be bookmakers. These sites collect customer data such as logins, passwords and bank details and use them for fraudulent purposes. To avoid this, you need to be sure that the site you are going to bet on has official criminal liability and positive reviews from other users.</p>
<p>Now on the Internet there are a lot of services where you can read reviews of bookmakers. For example, at <a href="https://esports-betting-bro.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esports-betting-bro.com</a> you will discover the best sites for eSports betting together with deep reviews. You can also find other valuable information regarding the wagering itself there such as bet types, helpful tips and many more.</p>
<p>Bettors are forced to disclose some of their personal data on the betting platform and to indicate payment details. The bookmaker guarantees confidentiality to its clients and an obligatory attribute of a modern betting portal should be an SSL protocol with 128-bit or 256-bit data encryption. It guarantees protection against hackers who may try to intercept data.</p>
<p>Recently, the verification procedure has become mandatory in all eSports bookmakers. What does she represent? When registering, the player enters a number of personal data: first name, last name, address of registration, date of birth. Verification is needed in order to confirm them. In its process, the player sends or shows scans of his documents. Why is it necessary for the platform? In this way, it protects itself from scammers and multi-accounts.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you keep your account login credentials secure and do not share them with anyone. This is because anyone with access to your account can use it to place bets or withdraw money without your knowledge. In addition, if you share your credentials, you may also expose yourself to malicious cyberattacks that can steal sensitive information such as personal banking details. For these reasons, it&#8217;s important to create strong passwords and never give out login details. Keep yourself safe by keeping all your account information private.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-197271 aligncenter" src="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cyberdb.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sport4.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
<p>Serious bookmakers should set up a customer service department that can take care of any problems that customers may have and provide assistance. Not only must employees be well-trained, but customer service itself must also be accessible. Accordingly, long working hours and various contact options are of great importance. In addition, at best, it should be possible to contact it for free.</p>
<p>Adopting the above cybersecurity measures will help you to enjoy eSports betting safely and keep your sensitive data protected. This will ensure the safety of your funds and help avoid unpleasant situations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 30% of German companies have suffered financial losses of more than one million dollars in each of the last three years as a result of the most serious case of data theft &#8211; in a global comparison, this is 3% more than similar incidents in other countries. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-197218"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of cybersecurity is therefore not a hotly debated topic for how to make </span><a href="https://woocasino.bet/au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Casino Australia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more safe. How will cybersecurity evolve over the next few years? Which trends will bring the greatest benefits? In this article, light will shed on current developments and to take a look into the future for you: what awaits us in 2023 in terms of IT security?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEARNINGS FROM THE PAST YEARS</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Verizon&#8217;s 2022 Cybersecurity Report, approximately 40% of global cyberattacks are data thefts of, for example, usernames and passwords, the latter via social engineering or phishing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurer Hiscox has determined in a statistic from 2021 that a cyber attack costs a company on average $17,000 (from, for example, $9,900 in Belgium to $28,000 in the UK &#8211; Germany is slightly above average mi $20,792).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophos surveyed 5,600 companies from 31 countries about ransomware in 2022. On average, 66% had reported at least one ransomware incident in the past year. In Germany, out of 400 companies surveyed, the figure was as high as 67%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verizon&#8217;s aforementioned Cybersecurity Report 2022 also found that financial interests, both by individuals and criminal organizations, are behind 65% of all cyberattacks on businesses. 31% are due to espionage. According to the Federal Situation Report Cybercrime 2020, financial motivation is also the greatest in Germany. Here, 40% of ransomware cases occur via desktop sharing applications, and in 35% of cases, emails with malicious links served as the Trojan horse. Phishing continues to be underestimated as a security risk! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ponemon Institute research center found in a survey that social engineering has increased at 62% of companies surveyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Bolster&#8217;s Cybersecurity Report 2021, most cyber fraud comes from the US, with Russia in second place, the British Virgin Islands in third, and Germany already in fourth, although &#8220;only&#8221; €2.5 of all malicious sites are hosted here, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to DDOS attacks, Cloudflare&#8217;s 2021 report puts China in first place. It is followed by the USA and Brazil, with Russia in sixth place.</span></p>
