These all things happened a few days after her ex-boyfriend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott">Travis Scott</a> generated many speculations related to them coming together. It is because of his single comment on the mascara Instagram post of the reality star</p>

<p>Some users have appreciated the look of mascara while others have appreciated the overall fashion of Kylie Jenner</p>
<p>When it comes to the product then it was revealed to have been in development for many years. It was launched back in 2015 and now has become one of the trendy things.</p>

<p>In the first picture, we can see her below the side while taking a selfie with a reflection on the steel bar.</p>
<p>It was the n*ked photo of the singer while sitting in the bathtub. Jessie J&#8217;s belly is shown through the front as well as through the side while covering her breast with her hands.</p>
<p>In the next picture, one can see her laying down in the bath while taking the view of some movies or maybe some series.</p>
<p>The next post was a video post where the singer was showing baby kicks inside her belly. Surely, the singer is loving her pregnancy but at the same time, baby kicks might be giving her a little hard time as well.</p>
<p>In the next picture which was the last one, we can see her wearing a Calvin Kelin brand sports bra and leggings in black color. She was also wearing black shoes while showing off her baby bump.</p>
<p>Through all these pictures, we can say that the mother is loving her pregnancy period and trying to capture every single moment with her baby. And that&#8217;s the reason why she has confessed to remembering this feeling forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jessie  J revealed her pregnancy on 19 March 2023. It was through a Mother&#8217;s Day post where the singer has written her heart out in the caption: &#8221;</p>
<p>You. Thank you for coming to me. Thank you for trusting me that my body can keep you safe. Thank you for gifting me with the most special experience already so far and with the most important role I will ever play in my entire life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The 5th season of the horror anthology will begin with a bang, as Shudder confirmed its renewal. Fans are anxiously anticipating the next episodes of the fifth season of the Slasher series. Aaron Martin developed the series, and each season follows a different plot.</p>
<p>The show has been a thrilling experience for fans since it debuted on April 1, 2016. The show&#8217;s past two seasons didn&#8217;t fare well because fans grew dissatisfied with the complex narrative lines, so expectations for the fifth season are high.</p>

<p>The 5th season of &#8220;Slasher,&#8221; titled &#8220;Slasher: Ripper,&#8221; presents us with Alistair Simcoe, a rich guy who is also a sleazy man with perverted instincts.</p>
<p>He used to use a knife to scar the faces of girls, making it more difficult for pimps to deliver their people to him.</p>
<p>One evening, a widow dressed in black and veiling her face slipped a twin blade into him and killed him in the most agonizing way possible.</p>
<p>Kenneth Rijkers, a Toronto police investigator, arrived on the site and questioned the witnesses if they had seen anything. According to Horatio and Terrance Crenshaw, Alistair was a monster who lived a double life and disguised his motives.</p>
<p>Regina continued to be in disbelief and didn&#8217;t believe her spouse could have committed such acts, but she understood that no one would have murdered him in such a way if he hadn&#8217;t harmed or hurt someone.</p>
<p>Viviana and Venetia Botticelli have a horrible reputation for keeping a secret. Verdi, their half-sister, was visiting, so they brought her to a magic performance. Viviana was madly in love with Basil Garvey, but he didn&#8217;t feel the same.</p>
<p>The magician, Georges Rondeau, was an occultist who considered magic to be one of the deadliest arts. His acts seemed creepy and painfully realistic, and it appeared as though he had murdered the girl he had been employing as a set for one of his tricks.</p>
<p>Despite Verdi&#8217;s assertion that she had zero interest in doing anything with Garvey, Viviana was mad and hit her. The Botticelli sisters were unable to harm Garvey and wanted someone to blame. Verdi felt powerless and stuck in the company of two ladies who were unable to accept reality.</p>
<p>Kenneth and the coroner discovered a piece of paper concealed within Alistair&#8217;s body, indicating that the murderer purposefully left the letter there to inform investigators.</p>
<p>Kashtinsky meets with Garvey and warns him that everyone who was involved in something 12 years ago is in great danger. The authorities have apprehended the incorrect person, and the killer remains free.</p>
<p>Kenneth discovered Alistair&#8217;s notebook, which contained details concerning Jack the Ripper and Margaret Mehar, and his execution was planned.</p>
<p>Basil thought Enid Jerkins was exaggerating things, so Garvey dispatched Eddie to the Devil&#8217;s elbow, where he encountered Horatio and Terrance Crenshaw.</p>
<p>Eddie murdered Daisy, one of Horatio&#8217;s favorite girls, and the disguised widow murdered Horatio in an identical manner. Several individuals with ulterior purposes attempted to take advantage of the situation.</p>

There are a lot of celebrities who were recently surrounded by dating rumors.</p>
<p>And most of these dating rumors come after a few months after their break up or separation from their previous partner. And because of the same reason, sometimes these celebrities come in front and talk directly or indirectly about all these things or keep it very diplomatic.</p>
<p>The same happened recently in Hollywood as many celebrities are surrounded by rumors of dating and finally decided to talk about it.</p>
<p>Emily Ratajkowski is one of them who has finally spoken about the kiss with Harry Styles. Talking about her relationship then the model confessed about a million of the same things that happened to her in any relationship.</p>
<p>And as a person, she is the one who does not think much about guys. Calling a relationship a thing that just happened, she still believes in love for sure.</p>

<h2>Here is what Emily Ratajkowski said about Kissing Harry Styles.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-245438" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Emily Ratajkowski" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-56.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The kiss that happened between Harry Styles and Emily Ratajkowski was in Tokyo, Japan. It was near the parking lot of the concert where Harry Styles was giving his best vocals.</p>
<p>They were very much involved in it which did not at all seem to be a friendship relation. They both were leaning against each other in a large SUV during the intimate scene.</p>
<p>It all happened after the model made headlines related to her relationship with Pete Davidson. She was also seen kissing the comedian and hugging him but they never came into a relationship.</p>
<p>Talking about her last stable relationship then it was with her ex-husband Sebastian with whom she shares a year-old son named, Sylvester.</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to her topic related to relationships then Emily said: &#8220;I’ve been trying to casually date and not get cuffed up, and it’s been hard to do that and be kind of mindful of the people that I’m seeing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to her relationship with Harry Styles then it has just started after Harry Styles got separated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Wilde">Olivia Wilde</a>.</p>
<p>Harry Styles and Olivia dated each other for 2 years and had a great bonding with the children of the actress. But due to work schedules and busy days, they decided to go their separate ways but carry the same respect and love for each other.</p>

<p>In a recent post, Avneet Kaur looked drop-dead gorgeous in camouflage cargo pants and a white crop top t-shirt with full sleeves and a lapel collar. The post fetched tons of likes and comments as fans were adoring her beautiful looks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Avneet has just completed the shootings for her upcoming Bollywood debut in a lead role, she will be seen alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawazuddin_Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a> in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiku_Weds_Sheru">Tiku Weds Sheru</a>, and the movie will be premiered on <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/offers/nonprimehomepage/ref=dvm_pds_amz_in_as_s_gm_5_mkw_sRaLgX5Sj-dc?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI07GP5sGX_gIVGB4rCh3gggodEAMYASAAEgKIW_D_BwE&amp;mrntrk=pcrid_610141119792_slid__pgrid_84577173048_pgeo_9301558_x__adext__ptid_kwd-361165631421">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p>
<p>Avneet has also started the shooting for a movie titled Luv Ki Arrange Marriage. Besides that, earlier this year it was announced that Avneet will replace actress Tunisha Sharma in the show Daastan-E-Kabul, this came after the actress passed away last year, fans got elated after the announcement but unfortunately, Avneet&#8217;s mother clarified that the rumors weren&#8217;t true.</p>

<h4>Recap Of Episode 2 Of Succession Season 4</h4>
<figure id="attachment_245356" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-245356" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-245356" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Succession Season 4 Episode 3" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-129.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-245356" class="wp-caption-text">Tom&#8217;s Guide</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the second episode, &#8220;Rehearsal,&#8221; Logan stops by the newsroom to share his plans to fundamentally alter ATN&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p>Logan, who is allowed to retain ownership of ATN under the terms of the GoJo sale, stops by the newsroom to make his plans to dramatically change its mission known.</p>
<p>The siblings are informed by Stewy and Sandi that they plan to veto the GoJo acquisition in order to negotiate a price hike at the upcoming board meeting of Waystar.</p>
<p>All but Shiv reject their offer and go to spend time with Connor, but Matsson secretly calls Kendall to threaten to cancel the acquisition if the price is pushed too low. As a result, Kendall unexpectedly shows interest in Stewy and Sandi&#8217;s proposal.</p>
<p>Kendall and Shiv are adamant about not making amends with their father, so Logan meets with them in a karaoke club to try to persuade them to agree to the GoJo sale.</p>
<p>Roman approaches Logan at his home because he is tired of his siblings&#8217; desire to resent him. Logan asks for his assistance in dealing with Matsson and offers him the role of head of ATN.</p>

<h4>What To Anticipate From Succession Season 4 Episode 3?</h4>
<figure id="attachment_245353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-245353" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-245353" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Succession Season 4 Episode 3" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-128.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-245353" class="wp-caption-text">The Independent</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Succession Season 4 Episode 3 trailer was made available by HBO after the second episode of the season.</p>
<p>The trailer demonstrates that the family is there during Connor&#8217;s wedding and reveals that there is some conflict among the siblings. As the season goes on, it will be interesting to see how the family dynamics change. You can watch the trailer right above:</p>
<p>Hence, the wedding of Connor and Willa will be the primary focus of Succession Season 4 Episode 3. It appears that the wedding will be equally fraught with family and work-related turmoil, as has been traditional for the show, as the last episode featured the hectic rehearsal dinner.</p>
<p>So, Connor&#8217;s wedding will continue the trend of dramatic Roy family weddings, as suggested by the trailer for the third episode of Season 4. There will be a disagreement with the frequently ignored Connor, who wonders if Willa is only with him for his money.</p>
<p>The Roy siblings will also try to delay the sale of the business in order to negotiate with Matsson for a good price. Roman&#8217;s covert collaboration with Logan will also probably cause the fragile relationship between the siblings to fall apart.</p>

<h2>Who was The Gentleman Killer in Slasher Season 5?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_245285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-245285" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-245285" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Slasher Season 5" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-52.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-245285" class="wp-caption-text">Father Son Holy Gor</figcaption></figure>
<p>It later turned out that the killer who was dropping bodies like flies all across the island is somebody we assumed had died earlier in the show, Dr. Trinn.</p>
<p>In an unexpected turn of events, we learn that Spencer played by David Cronenberg paid Trinn to murder the losers all through the tournament. Trinn had previously been somewhat of a Dr. Death, with many malpractice cases under her belt.</p>
<p>Then he put her on trial by making her murder O&#8217;Keefe&#8217;s biological dad, an artist with whom Florence had a love relationship in the past.</p>
<p>We learn that Trinn placed Merle&#8217;s corpse in the woodchipper and then feigned to tumble into it when Florence hurled a log at her.</p>
<p>She then hid her jewelry so the victims would believe it was her body they discovered in the woods.</p>
<p>Trinn then proceeded to murder every person on the island only until Theo, Vincent, and Liv survived. Vincent eventually killed Trinn in a fury after she taunted that she had weird mysteries about all 3 of them which would surface if she died without returning with an heir.</p>

<h4>Who will win the game of Slasher: Flesh and Blood?</h4>
<figure id="attachment_245286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-245286" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-245286" src="https://i0.wp.com/dailyresearchplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="Slasher Season 5" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-24.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-245286" class="wp-caption-text">1428 Elm</figcaption></figure>
<p>With Trinn gone, the final 3 survivors are in a state of turmoil. Vincent and Theo&#8217;s feud reaches a boiling point as Vincent attempts to kill his brother. But, Theo gains the advantage and brutally murders his brother by slicing his skull in half.</p>
<p>Theo and Liv then assume they can acquire and split the fortune, but Theo begins making strange, classist remarks that become increasingly frightening as he speaks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Theo divulges the great &#8220;secret&#8221; that Trinn alluded to before, that  He was intoxicated and crashed his automobile into a creche when he was younger. Spencer compensated all of the families of the deceased children.</p>
<p>Instead of expressing regret, Theo concedes that the entire situation may have been good because those parents were pleased with the cash, and Spencer persuaded him to look on the bright side of things. It&#8217;s disgusting, and it suggests that Theo has more of Spencer&#8217;s crazy nature in him than he previously thought.</p>
<p>A shocked Liv kills Theo as he&#8217;s resting in her embrace, breaking his neck and leaving her as Spencer&#8217;s only heir. Liv sets the scene to make it look as though Trinn slaughtered everyone before eventually leaving.</p>
<p>She comes back later, now pregnant with Theo&#8217;s child, to handle the house. Liv discloses to her broker that she&#8217;s expecting a girl, which she&#8217;s relieved about since she&#8217;s not sure she could bear looking into the face of a kid who may resemble Spencer, Theo, or Vincent.</p>
<p>Liv gets a glimpse of all the Galloway family members gazing at her as she takes her place at the top of the table and speaks about how she knows how desperation can cause people to do awful things in the last moments of the finale. Is this a sign that Liv may one day become as wicked as Spencer?</p>
