      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advisory is available at the following link:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-pi-epnm-xss-mZShH2J"&gt;https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-pi-epnm-xss-mZShH2J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			&lt;p&gt;Cisco Meraki devices implement a Local Status Page (LSP) feature. This is a web-based interface that is primarily intended to provide administrators with the ability to apply configuration settings that are required for the device to connect to the Cisco Meraki Dashboard, perform local troubleshooting, or monitor the device status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LSP requires authentication. When configured with the factory default settings, credentials for the LSP are comprised of the device hardware serial number as the username and an empty password. An attacker can take advantage of the low entropy of the default credentials as well as the lack of a mechanism that limits login attempts to carry out a brute-force attack against the LSP authentication form. If successful, the attacker may gain unauthorized access to the LSP and use it to modify sensitive configuration options, cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, or obtain low-privileged information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LSP is enabled by default. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The hardware serial number is visible on the device surface and is printed on the shipment packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities in the scanning engines of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance, formerly Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured rule, thereby allowing traffic onto a network that should have been blocked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities exist because malformed, encoded traffic is not properly detected. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting through an affected device to a malicious server and receiving malformed HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and &lt;span class="more"&gt;Cisco &lt;span lang="EN-IN"&gt;Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with level-15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to errors that occur when retrieving the public release key that is used for image signature verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying specific variables in the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, the complexity of an attack using this vulnerability is high. However, an attacker with level-15 privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software on a device to a release that would lower the attack complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advisory is available at the following link:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9300-spi-ace-yejYgnNQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9300-spi-ace-yejYgnNQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in the access point (AP) joining process of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when certain conditions are met during the AP joining process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding an AP that is under their control to the network. The attacker then must ensure that the AP successfully joins an affected wireless controller under certain conditions. Additionally, the attacker would need the ability to restart a valid AP that was previously connected to the controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in Cisco access point (AP) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters within 802.11 frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a wireless 802.11 association request frame with crafted parameters to&amp;nbsp;an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Routers Bidirectional Forwarding Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT?vs_f=Cisco%20Security%20Advisory&amp;vs_cat=Security%20Intelligence&amp;vs_type=RSS&amp;vs_p=Cisco%20IOS%20XR%20Software%20for%20ASR%209000%20Series%20Routers%20Bidirectional%20Forwarding%20Detection%20Denial%20of%20Service%20Vulnerability&amp;vs_k=1</link>
      <description>
			
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) hardware offload feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed BFD packets that are received on line cards where the BFD hardware offload feature is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause&amp;nbsp;line card exceptions or a hard reset, resulting in loss of traffic over that line card while the line card reloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
