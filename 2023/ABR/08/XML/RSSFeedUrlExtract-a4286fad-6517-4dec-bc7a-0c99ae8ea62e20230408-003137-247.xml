      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, the team discusses some weirdness at Twitter, AirTag used in murder, the Turkish ET, Doge on Twitter  and more.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the 293<sup>rd</sup> episode of the Kaspersky <em>Transatlantic Cable </em>podcast, we are down to a two-man booth as both Dave and Jag are away on vacation. To kick things off, Ahmed and I take a look at a story that pulls the curtain back on one of the web&#8217;s most notorious websites – 4Chan. We were kind of shocked when we saw who was one of the benefactors and am pretty sure that you will be as well.</p>
<p>We then climb out of the cesspool before falling into a story on a scam targeting taxpayers. From there, the third story we look at a positive case for AI – yes, you read that right, we are positive on AI for once on the podcast. In this story, a university student uses AI to help get her out of a ticket.</p>
<p>The happy stories end there, as our next tale looks tragically at a use of airtags for vigilante justice in Texas. If you read the headline below, you know the story. To close things out, we talk about Elon Musk&#8217;s weird move of adding the Dodge Coin logo to Twitter, replacing the very familiar bird.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[How to select the best VPN protocol and fastest VPN services.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VPNs are becoming more and more popular: a secure, encrypted connection is needed these days not only by travelers, but also gamers, streamers, crypto investors and even fans of foreign TV shows. And that&#8217;s why the VPN industry is developing rapidly. But did you know that just by updating your <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">VPN application</a> and configuring it a bit you can significantly increase the speed, convenience and security of your connection? You will after reading this post!
</p>
<h2>New protocols</h2>
<p>
When you turn on a VPN connection you establish an <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/vpn-what-you-need-to-know/14468/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encrypted connection</a> to one of the VPN provider&#8217;s servers. This is done to change your public IP address and to protect your connection from prying eyes on the local network. For many years, all VPN services offered a choice between the old and not very secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PPTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">L2TP</a> communication protocols, and the newer yet slower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenVPN</a> protocol — which is more secure in terms of encryption.</p>
<p>But recently some new VPN protocols have appeared. For example, there&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.vpnreports.com/hydra-catapult-protocol-explained/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Catapult Hydra</a> protocol used in <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection</a>. It&#8217;s the record holder for speed, and thanks to this protocol <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">our VPN</a> recently <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ksc-wins-av-test-2022/46586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won a comparative test of leading VPN solutions.</a> Due to the proprietary nature of the Catapult Hydra protocol, security researchers have raised questions about its security and privacy. However, a recent <a href="https://www.pango.co/application-security-audit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">independent audit of the Catapult Hydra source code</a> found no critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Another popular protocol to look out for is <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WireGuard</a>. It&#8217;s also faster (much more so than OpenVPN) at transferring data, has minimal latency, and provides an instant connection. At the same time, its source codes are open, so it can be found in many VPN services, including <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What to do: </strong>update the application and  select the correct protocol in the VPN client settings on each device. Speeds in descending order go like this: Catapult Hydra, WireGuard, OpenVPN. Other protocols don&#8217;t provide sufficient security — especially for financial transactions.
</p>
<h2>Optimal servers</h2>
<p>
The key thing to look out for when choosing a VPN service is the number of servers it has and their location. The more servers — the greater the chance of a good connection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s logical to choose a server based on your needs: either as close as possible to your actual geographical location, or located in the region whose websites you plan to visit.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re using a VPN for <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/online-gamer-threats/4474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe gaming</a>, you should choose a VPN server in the same country where the game servers are located — this will ensure a faster, more stable connection.</p>
<p>When watching foreign media content, servers located in the country where the content is streamed also tend to provide a more stable connection.</p>
<p>Sometimes municipal or government services aren&#8217;t available from abroad for various reasons. In this case, the right VPN server helps residents of the city, or citizens of the country, get the information they need while away from home.</p>
<p>What can happen is the nearest server being overloaded and its connection speed drops as a consequence. In this case it&#8217;s worth trying other servers in the same region. By the way, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">Kaspersky VPN</a> outperforms most competitors not only in terms of speed, but also in terms of the number of available servers: 99 locations in 80 countries, with more than 2000 servers deployed.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> update the application regularly and check for an updated list of servers. Choose the best VPN server for your tasks, taking into account the geographical proximity to the required online services.</p>

<h2>Protecting all devices and the entire network</h2>
<p>
Every VPN service has clients for Windows, iOS and Android, but software manufacturers sometimes ignore Mac computers. However, there is an effective solution not only for Macs, but also for Smart TVs, game consoles, and smart-home devices that don&#8217;t support VPNs themselves. This is a VPN security setting on your router that allows you to route all traffic from any device on your home network through the VPN.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">our VPN</a> can work on a router — and it has a &#8220;native&#8221; Mac version as well.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Make sure that all your devices are running through a VPN, especially those which you use to conduct financial transactions.
</p>
<h2>Advanced settings</h2>
<p>
At first, almost all VPN applications worked on the principle of a simple switch: turn on/turn off. But in real life this isn&#8217;t always convenient. For example, a smartphone owner wants to always protect a crypto wallet application with a VPN, and doesn&#8217;t want to work with finances through an unencrypted connection; meanwhile, some online stores require that the VPN be turned off. Some people may also need to ensure that not a single byte goes into the network without encryption.</p>
<p>Therefore, modern VPN applications offer settings such as <em>Split Tunneling</em> and a <em>Kill Switch</em>.</p>
<p><em>Split Tunneling</em> lets you choose applications that always work through the VPN, or, conversely, without it. It&#8217;s convenient, for example, to use two different browsers: one that provides access to sites through the VPN, and the other directly.</p>
<p>The <em>Kill Switch</em>, on the other hand, prevents any data from being sent if the VPN connection is unexpectedly interrupted — say, when the device connects to another network. This can happen, for example, when your smartphone automatically switches from cellular data to known Wi-Fi networks. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/vpn-secure-connection?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____vpn___" target="_blank">Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection</a> supports both features.</p>
<div id="attachment_47767" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/04/05141655/fastest-vpn-wireguard-hydra-servers-02.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47767" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-47767" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/04/05141655/fastest-vpn-wireguard-hydra-servers-02.jpg" alt="Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection settings for Android." width="540" height="1065"></a><p id="caption-attachment-47767" class="wp-caption-text">Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection settings for Android.</p></div>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> configure the VPN individually for those applications that need it, or, conversely, disable the VPN for certain applications. Use different browsers to simultaneously access sites with and without a VPN protocol. If protecting your traffic is essential, enable the <em>Kill Switch</em>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Korean scientists have come up with a way to exfiltrate data from an isolated computer via the built-in speaker mounted on the motherboard.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at Korea University in Seoul have published a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23702294-sensors-23-02970?responsive=1&#038;title=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">paper</a> detailing a new method of data theft from a computer that has maximum protection; that is — placed in an isolated room and surrounded with an air gap (i.e., connected to neither the internet nor a local network). This type of attack may serve as a last resort for a malicious actor when no other, simpler methods are feasible.</p>
<p>Data exfiltration in this case uses the computer&#8217;s speaker: not some plug-in device, but a relic of the first personal computers — the internal speaker, also known as the &#8220;PC speaker&#8221;. Motherboards still typically feature one for compatibility, and it turns out that such a speaker can be used for data exfiltration.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
We&#8217;ve published several stories on data-theft methods. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/non-standard-smartphone-wiretapping/47113/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This one</a>, for instance, is about wiretapping smartphones by using their built-in accelerometer. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/covid-bit-attack/46665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This story</a> is about data being stolen by manipulating the radio signal from the CPU power supply. Data exfiltration via the speaker mounted on the motherboard might appear unsophisticated in comparison with those two methods, but let&#8217;s not forget that the simpler the attack — the higher the odds of success. Besides, an attacker needs no specialized equipment to obtain the precious data: all it takes is bringing a smartphone close to the target computer.</p>
<p>Any research of this kind starts with a description of a hypothetical attack scenario. In this case, it&#8217;s this one: let&#8217;s take a government or corporate computer that holds secret information. The data is so highly classified that the computer is isolated from the internet, and possibly even the LAN, for enhanced security; but the scenario implies that the computer still gets infected with spyware one way or another. However, finding out exactly how this occurred isn&#8217;t the subject of the researchers&#8217; paper. Suppose a spy managed to get a flash drive into the secured room and plug it into the computer. Or, the computer could have been infected via a <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supply-chain attack</a> even before it was delivered to the organization.</p>
<p>So, the spy program has collected the secrets, but now the attacker needs a way to get them out of there. In the scenario used by the Korean researchers, the spy physically enters the room where the computer is, bringing with them a smartphone with basic sound recording software running. The spyware broadcasts the data in the form of audio signals at a frequency so high that most humans&#8217; ears can&#8217;t hear it. The smartphone records that sound, which is then decoded by the attackers to restore the data.</p>
<p>Importantly, research on data exfiltration through speakers has been carried out before. This 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research paper</a> from Israel demonstrates a way for two computers to communicate via ultrasound using loudspeakers and a built-in microphone. That theoretical attack method has one flaw, though: imagine a computer that controls valuable equipment. Would company really fit it with additional external audio devices for the operator&#8217;s comfort? Thus, this attack is feasible only if the protected information is stored on a laptop, because laptops usually have integrated audio speakers.
</p>
<h2>The challenges of pulling off an ultrasound heist</h2>
<p>
The Korean researchers suggest that their attacker would use the built-in PC speaker. Back in 1981, that was the only sound device on the first IBM PC. Although PC speaker mostly produced only squeaky noises, some video game developers managed to use its crude capabilities to create decent soundtracks. Modern PCs seldom use the internal speaker for anything but diagnostics. If the computer just won&#8217;t boot up, a technician can identify the errors by the number and duration of tones that the built-in speaker is emitting. The original eighties&#8217; PC speaker was a separate unit attached to the motherboard connectors. Modern circuit boards typically have a tiny speaker soldered onto them.</p>
<p>The Korean researchers needed to demonstrate a reliable data-transfer channel that uses the speaker and, more importantly, a practical one. The transmission part was fairly simple: &#8220;malware&#8221; running on an Ubuntu Linux-powered machine alternated between short 18kHz and 19kHz beeps, with the former being the &#8220;dot&#8221;, and the latter — the &#8220;dash&#8221;. This could be used for sending information in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Morse code</a>, which is typically used for radio communication. If you record this sound transmission (inaudible to most humans) on a smartphone, you get something like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_47741" style="width: 587px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47741" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/04/04184047/pc-speaker-data-exfiltration-spectrogram.jpg" alt="Spectrogram of signals transferring data via the speaker" width="577" height="430" class="size-full wp-image-47741"><p id="caption-attachment-47741" class="wp-caption-text">Spectrogram of signals through the built-in speaker and recorded on a smartphone. The lines at the top are &#8220;dots&#8221; and &#8220;dashes&#8221; that make up the data being transmitted. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23702294-sensors-23-02970?responsive=1&#038;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>.</p></div>
<p>The spectrogram shows the sounds used for encoding the word &#8220;covert&#8221;. It took roughly four seconds to transfer just six characters, so the exfiltration process is slow but still usable for certain types of information such as passwords and encryption keys. The lines at 18kHz and 19kHz are the signals produced by the computer speaker. Their volume is similar to the background noise inside the room, which can be seen in the bottom portion of the spectrogram.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted multiple experiments to arrive at ideal conditions for data transfer: the data rate had to stay at or below 20 bits per second for data to be received reliably from a distance of up to 1.5 meters. Slowing down the transmission even further could increase that distance by about half a meter. Placing the phone centimeters away from the system unit allowed doubling the data transfer rate. Anything but brief snippets of data would take hours to transmit, making an attack impractical.
</p>
<h2>An air gap does not guarantee a secure system</h2>
<p>
Ultrasound data transfer is a well-researched method that&#8217;s sometimes used for consumer purposes. In a secured environment, this <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/side-channel-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side channel</a> poses a threat. The Korean researchers suggest removing the speaker from the motherboard as a safeguard against this type of attack. However, as we know from other studies, when the stakes are high and the adversary is committed to spending both time and resources to achieve their goal, it&#8217;s hard to protect against every possible data exfiltration trick. Removing the built-in speaker still leaves the possibility of capturing radio waves from SATA cables, the CPU or the monitor, albeit by using far more sophisticated methods.</p>
<p>Maximum isolation of any computer that stores secret data is imperative. However, it&#8217;s so much more practical to invest in a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/enterprise-security/anti-targeted-attack-platform?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">malware detection system</a>, remembering that every espionage scenario begins with attackers installing malware on the target system. Nonetheless, the Korean researchers&#8217; work teaches us about new covert channels that can be used for data theft.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[How electronics repair services treat customer privacy, and whether you can trust your data to them.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably everyone has damaged their smartphone, tablet or laptop and needed it repaired at least once in their lives. The cause of the damage may be the user&#8217;s own sloppiness: replacing broken smartphone screens brought countless billions of dollars to the industry. But more often, it&#8217;s just a random malfunction like the battery failing, the hard drive dying, or a key coming off the keyboard. And this can happen at any time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern devices are made in such a way that even the handiest of computer wizards are often unable to fix them on their own. The repairability of smartphones is steadily decreasing from year to year. To fix the latest models, it takes not only skill and a general understanding of how all sorts of digital gizmos work; you also now need specialist tools, expertise, and access to documentation plus unique spare parts.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a smartphone or laptop breaks, the user usually has little choice other than finding a service center. After all, simply throwing out your broken device, buying another and starting over normally isn&#8217;t an option because you&#8217;d probably like to recover all the data that was on it. So, it&#8217;s over to the service center you head. But there&#8217;s a problem: you have to pass your device into the hands of a stranger. Photos and videos, correspondence and call history, documents and financial information can all end up being directly accessible by somebody you don&#8217;t know. Can this person be trusted?</p>
<h2>Homemade porn viewings at repair shops are a thing</h2>
<p>
I personally gave this some serious thought recently after what a friend of mine told me. He&#8217;d had an informal chat with some guys working at a small repair shop. They told him without any hesitation how they occasionally held viewings of homemade porn found on the devices they repair for employees and their friends!</p>
<p>Similar incidents pop up in the news from time to time. Employees <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/geek-squad-nude_n_3749201" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stealing</a> private photos of customers have been found in <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/woman-catches-apple-technician-stealing-her-nude-photos-during-phone-repair-1671893" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more than one service center</a>. And sometimes even <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/2018/12/17/police-find-13-who-say-their-images-were-used-in-nude-photo-sharing-case-at-video-store/6620617007/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bigger stories</a> emerge: in one case, service-center employees not only stole photos of female customers for years, but also put together entire collections of them and shared them.</p>
<p>But, surely such incidents are exceptions to common practice? Not every service center has staff eager to get their hands on customers&#8217; personal data, right? Unfortunately, results of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05824.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> I recently came across show that breaches of customer privacy by maintenance technicians are a much more common problem than we would all like to think. In fact, it seems highly likely that excessive curiosity on the part of repair staff is a feature of this industry rather than isolated outrageous incidents. But let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves. I&#8217;ll take you through it all step by step.</p>
<h2>How electronics repair services treat their customers&#8217; data</h2>
<p>
A study was conducted by researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada. It consists of four parts, two of them devoted to the analysis of conversations with customers of repair services, and two were field studies in service shops themselves (which I will focus on here). In the first of the &#8220;field&#8221; parts, the researchers tried to find out how repair shops treat privacy in terms of their intentions. First and foremost, the researchers were interested in what privacy policies or procedures the service shops had in place to safeguard customers&#8217; data.</p>
<p>To do this, the researchers visited nearly 20 service shops of various types (from small local repairers to regional and national service providers). The reason for each visit was to replace the battery in an ASUS UX330U laptop. The reason behind the choice of malfunction was simple: diagnosing the problem and solving it does not require access to the operating system, and all the necessary tools for this are in the laptop&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UEFI</a> (the researchers use the old-fashioned term BIOS).</p>
<p>The researchers&#8217; visits to the service centers involved several steps. First, they looked for any information readily available to the customer regarding the service center&#8217;s data privacy policy. Second, they checked to see if the employee taking the device would request the username and password to log in to the operating system and, if so, how they would justify the need to hand that information over (there&#8217;s no obvious reason for this because, as stated, battery replacement doesn&#8217;t require access to the operating system). Third, the researchers noted how the password for the device being handed over for repair was stored. Finally, fourth, they asked the employee accepting the equipment a direct and unambiguous question: &#8220;How do you make sure no one will access my personal data?&#8221; to find out what privacy policies and protocols were in place. </p>
<p>The results of this part of the study were disappointing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the service shops visited by the researchers informed the &#8220;customers&#8221; about any respective privacy policy before accepting the device.</li>
<li>Except for a single regional center, all services asked for the login password – arguing that it&#8217;s simply <em>required</em> for either diagnostics or repair, or to check the quality of provided services (which, as mentioned above, isn&#8217;t the case).</li>
<li>When asked if it was possible to perform battery replacement without a password, all three national providers replied &#8220;no&#8221;. At five smaller services they said that without a password they wouldn&#8217;t be able to check the quality of work carried out and therefore refused to take responsibility for the results of the repair. Another shop suggested removing the password altogether if the customer didn&#8217;t want to share it! And finally, the last shop visited said that if they&#8217;re not given the password the device could be reset to factory settings should the maintenance technician need to do so.</li>
<li>As for storage of credentials, in almost all cases they were stored in an electronic database along with the customer&#8217;s name, phone number and e-mail address, but there was no explanation as to who could access this database.</li>
<li>In about half of cases, the credentials were also physically attached to the laptop handed over for repair. It was either printed out and attached as a sticker (in the case of larger services), or simply handwritten on a sticky note – that&#8217;s classic! Thus, it would appear that any of the employees of the service shops (maybe even casual visitors too) could have access to the passwords.</li>
<li>When asked how data privacy would be guaranteed, the employee who accepted the device and other repair staff gave assurances that only the technician repairing the device would have access to it. However, further inquiries showed that there was no mechanism that could guarantee this; only their word was to be had on this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So what do maintenance technicians do with customers&#8217; personal data?</h2>
<p>
Having found out that the service centers have no mechanisms to curb the curiosity of their specialists, in the next part of the study, the researchers began examining what actually happens to a device after it&#8217;s handed over for repair. To do this, they bought six new laptops and simulated a basic problem with the audio driver on them. They simply turned it off. Therefore, the &#8220;repair&#8221; needed just superficial diagnostics and quickly fixing the problem by turning it on. This particular malfunction was chosen since, unlike other services (such as removing viruses from the system), &#8220;fixing&#8221; the audio driver requires no access to user files whatsoever.</p>
<p>The researchers made up fictitious user identities on the laptops (male users in the first half of the experiment and female users in the second half). They created a browser history, email and gaming accounts, and added various files – including photos of the experimenters. Also added was the first &#8220;bait&#8221;: a file with the credentials to a cryptocurrency wallet. The second bait was a separate folder containing mildly explicit images. The researchers used real female-coded pictures from Reddit users for the experiment (after having obtained consent beforehand, of course).</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, before the laptops were handed over to the service, the researchers turned on the Windows Problem Steps Recorder utility, which records every action performed on the device. After that, the laptops were passed on &#8220;for repair&#8221; to 16 service centers. Again, to get a complete picture, the researchers visited both small local services and centers of major regional or national providers. The genders of the &#8220;customers&#8221; were evenly distributed: in eight cases devices were configured with a fictional female persona, and in the other eight – with a male one.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the researchers found out:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite its simplicity, the problem with the audio driver was solved in the &#8220;customer&#8217;s&#8221; presence after a short wait in just two cases. In all other experiments, the laptops had to be left until at least the next day. And the service centers of national service providers kept them in for &#8220;repair&#8221; for at least two days.</li>
<li>For two local services, it wasn&#8217;t possible to collect the logs of the repair staff&#8217;s actions. In one case, a plausible reason for this couldn&#8217;t be found. In the other, the researchers were told that maintenance technicians had to run antivirus software on the device and cleanup its disk due to multiple viruses (the researchers were absolutely sure that at the time of drop-off, the laptop could not have been infected).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the other cases, the researchers were able to explore the logs; here are their findings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Among the remaining logs, the researchers found six cases where the repairers gained access to personal files or browser history. In four cases, this was recorded on the &#8220;females'&#8221; laptops; the other two – on the &#8220;males'&#8221; ones.</li>
<li>In half of the incidents, curious service center employees tried to hide traces of their actions by clearing the list of most recently opened Windows files.</li>
<li>The repair staff were most interested in image folders. Their contents (including explicit photos) were viewed in five cases. Four of the laptops in these cases &#8220;belonged to&#8221; females, the other – to male.</li>
<li>Browser history was the subject of interest for two laptops – both &#8220;belonging to&#8221; males.</li>
<li>Financial data was viewed once – on a &#8220;male&#8217;s&#8221; device.</li>
<li>In two cases, user files were copied by maintenance technicians to an external device. Both times, they were explicit photos, and in one case, the aforementioned financial data was added.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_47719" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/04/03134204/repair-shops-privacy-issues-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47719" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/04/03134204/repair-shops-privacy-issues-1.png" alt="Results of a study on customer privacy violations by service-center employees]" width="3000" height="1331" class="size-full wp-image-47719"></a><p id="caption-attachment-47719" class="wp-caption-text">In about half of all cases, service-center employees gained access to user files. They were almost always interested in pictures – including explicit photos</p></div>
<h2>How to protect yourself from nosy maintenance technicians</h2>
<p>
Of course, it should be borne in mind that this is a Canadian study. It wouldn&#8217;t be right to project its results onto all countries. Nevertheless, I somehow doubt that the situation generally around the world is much better. It&#8217;s likely that service centers in most countries, just as in Canada, have no cogent mechanisms in place to prevent their employees from violating customer privacy. And it&#8217;s also likely that such employees take advantage of the lack of restrictions set by their employers to pry into customers&#8217; personal data – especially that of women.</p>
<p>So, before you take your device to the service center, it&#8217;s worth doing a little preparation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to make a complete backup of all data contained on the device to an external storage device or to the cloud (if possible, of course). It&#8217;s standard practice for service centers to make no guarantees as to the safety of customer data, so you may well lose valuable files in the course of a repair.</li>
<li>Ideally, your device should be completely cleared of all data and reset to factory settings before taking it in for repair. For example, this is exactly what <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201557" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple recommends doing</a>.</li>
<li>If clearing and preparing the device for service isn&#8217;t possible (for example, your smartphone&#8217;s display is broken), then try to find a service that will do everything quickly and directly in front of you. Smaller centers are usually more flexible in this regard.</li>
<li>As for laptops, it may be sufficient to hide all confidential information in a crypto container (for instance, using a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/premium?icid=gb_bb2022-kdplacehd_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kdaily_lnk_sm-team___kprem___" target="_blank">security solution</a>), or at least in a password-protected archive.</li>
<li>Owners of Android smartphones should use the <a href="https://support.kaspersky.com/KISA/Android_11.55/en-US/144306.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app locking feature</a> in <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/premium?icid=gb_bb2022-kdplacehd_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kdaily_lnk_sm-team___kprem___" target="_blank">Kaspersky Premium for Android</a>. It allows to lock all your apps using a separate pin code that&#8217;s in no way related to the one used to unlock your smartphone.</li>
</ul>

      <description><![CDATA[How to get across the importance of information security without a budget for proper training.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="background-color: #e5f0ec; padding: 10px 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
Disclaimer. This is the April Fools&#8217; Day blog post. The methods of &#8220;cybersecurity trainings&#8221; described in it are not entirely ethical, and are not universally considered acceptable. We recommend that you think twice before using them in real life and ideally obtain the consent of the team for such actions beforehand. </div>
<p>When it comes to information security, the weakest link is — and always has been — humans. That&#8217;s why our blogposts often advise companies to provide <a href="https://k-asap.com/en/?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kasap___" target="_blank">cybersecurity trainings for employees</a>. Unfortunately, not all companies can afford to allocate the necessary funds for this. Another problem is that not all employees take such lessons seriously, so the knowledge they acquire often remains purely theoretical.</p>
<p>The good news is that this problem can be solved without spending huge sums of money. Below are a few fun and effective ways to demonstrate to your dear colleagues the importance of information security.</p>
<h2>Passwords on sticky notes and printouts</h2>
<p>
One of the most dangerous habits that, sadly, many office employees are still guilty of is noting down passwords on scraps of paper and leaving them in public view. Even thousands of memes down the years of passwords stuck on monitors have failed to curb this practice.</p>
<p>The threat here is obvious: anyone visiting the office can take out their phone and discreetly snap all sticky notes with account credentials that catch their eye. Sometimes notes with passwords accidentally go public. For example, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/unusual-ways-to-leak-info/36049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not uncommon</a> for a password to get leaked during a workplace interview or through some office photo posted on a social network.</p>
<div id="attachment_47704" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47704" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/03/31133918/security-awareness-training-diy-ideas-passwords.png" alt="Workplace interview with a revealing backdrop" width="498" height="487" class="size-full wp-image-47704"><p id="caption-attachment-47704" class="wp-caption-text">Prince William gives an interview with login credentials pinned to the wall behind him for the Military Flight Information Publications (MilFLIP) system of the Royal Air Force</p></div>
<p>To discourage sticky-notes lovers from resorting to scribbling their passwords on them, you will need: a pen, several sticky notes, and someone good at imitating others&#8217; handwriting; for printouts with passwords, nothing&#8217;s needed besides the printer itself. Armed with these simple tools, try replacing such sticky notes at the employee&#8217;s workplace — with similar but incorrect passwords. Then observe from a safe distance how the poor soul tries to log in to their account. And try not to laugh too loudly.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should leave the real sticky notes in a place where the involuntary test subject will find them after a while — otherwise they may think that it was just some system glitch or something like that (a lot depends on how tech-savvy the person is, in general). And be sure to point the hapless sinner in the direction of a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/password-manager?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kpm___" target="_blank">good password manager</a> for storing credentials the proper way.</p>
<input type="hidden" class="category_for_banner" value="kpm-download" />
<h2>Unlocked computers</h2>
<p>
Also dangerous is the habit of leaving one&#8217;s computer unlocked when away from one&#8217;s workstation. This too, unfortunately, is not uncommon. Even more unfortunately, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to manage this issue at a company-wide level.</p>
<p>Unlike with passwords on sticky notes, the risk here&#8217;s not of accidentally leaking sensitive information, but, should a hostile visitor come to the office, the threat can be just as grave — if not more so: it wouldn&#8217;t take long to infect an unlocked computer with malware. And after that, the options for attackers are far-ranging: from industrial espionage to a small but nasty <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/ransomware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ransomware </a>infection.</p>
<p>Dealing with careless employees who don&#8217;t lock their computers is quite easy — and also rather entertaining, and you need just your own quick wits and dexterous hands to do it. The general strategy here&#8217;s very simple: wait until your colleague leaves their workstation, then do something &#8220;interesting&#8221; on their unlocked computer.</p>
<p>There are several proven tactics. The most effective is to write a chat message or e-mail on their behalf. For example, you might offer to buy an after-work drink for everyone in the department. Or pen a passionate e-mail. The choice is yours. Let your creative impulses run free — the wilder, the better (without overdoing it, of course).</p>
<p>The second option is quick and easy: on the unlocked computer, find an <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/adult-content-privacy-security/35315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting image</a> online and set it as the desktop wallpaper. The advantage here is that the victim cannot fail to miss the point: the demonstration will be literally in their face. True, the therapeutic effect may be lower due to the less public nature of the act. If you have enough time, these tactics can even be combined, and they do complement each other nicely.</p>
<p>To spare the employee any more such embarrassment and to protect the company&#8217;s security going forward, advise setting up automatic lockout after a short period of inactivity. And also explain what key combination to use to instantly lock the computer in one hand movement: on Windows it&#8217;s [Win] + [L], and on macOS it&#8217;s [Cmd] + [Ctrl] + [Q] (this information can be stuck to the screen:).</p>
<h2>Unattended smartphones</h2>
<p>
An unlocked smartphone left unattended also poses a cybersecurity risk. Sure, the chances of an attacker using it to spread ransomware over the corporate network are low. But a hostile visitor could still get hold of some useful contact details with the intention of using them for social engineering, or plant spyware on the device. In other words, there can be some very unpleasant scenarios both for the company and personally for the smartphone owner.</p>
<p>In general, the training methods from the previous case apply here too: you can compose an interesting chat message or e-mail, or download a &#8220;nice&#8221; picture and set it as wallpaper. But there&#8217;s an additional tactic for maximum effect in the minimum time: photograph something unexpected on the unattended phone. For example, a picture of you or a mutual colleague in an interesting pose (with the latter&#8217;s consent, of course).</p>
<p>Afterward, as before, instruct the employee to set up automatic lockout after a short period of inactivity. Since there&#8217;s no need to enter a long password to unlock a smartphone nowadays (presenting a fingerprint or your face will do), this period should be very short — say, 30–60 seconds.</p>
<h2>Abandoned passes</h2>
<p>
Another not-so-good habit is to leave your pass unattended. For our hostile visitor, a valid pass is a real find — one that can be used to break into the company&#8217;s office and gain physical access to corporate computers or documents.</p>
<p>To wean careless colleagues off this dangerous habit, you will need:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An office printer/scanner/copier</li>
<li>A plastic card the same size as the errant pass</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Glue </li>
<li>A little diligence</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the unattended pass, photocopy it, carefully cut it out, glue it to your plastic imitation pass, and insert your artistic masterpiece into the holder in place of the real pass. Put said real pass in a place where the &#8220;victim&#8221; will find it later.</p>
<p>If possible, try to be at the security gate when the victim tries to exit the office, and see how they explain to the guards (if you have any, of course) who they are and why they&#8217;re using a forged pass.</p>
<p>Note, however, that this is a rather severe form of training, which could lead to a conflict between you and the other employee. We therefore recommend it only as a last resort after all words of warning have failed.</p>
<h2>Entrust the matter to professionals</h2>
<p>
Of course, the methods described above are no substitute for full-fledged cybersecurity training, if only because they cover just a handful of the potential threats. That said, if your security budget is non-existent, they provide a good starting point.</p>
<p>Ideally, they should be used as bait to get employees thinking about information security, as well as to consolidate knowledge acquired during full-fledged training.

      <description><![CDATA[SmoothOperator: attack via the supply chain on clients of the 3CX VoIP telephony system.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Various media sources are <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reporting</a> a mass supply-chain attack targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3CX_Phone_System" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">3CX VoIP telephony system</a> users. Unknown attackers have managed to infect 3CX VoIP applications for both Windows and macOS. Now the cybercriminals are attacking their users via a weaponized application signed with a valid 3CX certificate. The list of those users is quite something — consisting of more than 600,000 companies, including well-known brands from all over the world (American Express, BMW, Air France, Toyota, IKEA). A number of researchers have dubbed this malicious attack SmoothOperator.</p>
<p>Apparently, trojans are hiding in all versions of the software that were released after March 3; that is, builds 18.12.407 and 18.12.416 for Windows, and 18.11.1213 and newer for macOS. According to 3CX representatives, the malicious code got into the program because of some unnamed trojanized open-source component that was used by the development team.</p>
<h2>The attack via trojanized 3CX software</h2>
<p>Citing researchers from various companies, BleepingComputer <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">describes</a> the attack mechanism via a trojanized Windows client as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user either downloads an installation package from the company&#8217;s official website and runs it, or receives an update for an already installed program;</li>
<li>Once installed, the trojanized program creates several malicious libraries, which are used for the next stage of the attack;</li>
<li>The malware then downloads .ico files hosted on GitHub with additional lines of data inside;</li>
<li>These lines are then used to download the final malicious payload — the one used to attack end users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanism for attacking macOS users is somewhat different. You can find its <a href="https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x73.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">detailed description</a> on the website of the Objective-See non-profit foundation.</p>
<h2>What are the hackers after?</h2>
<p>The downloaded malware is able to gather information about the system, as well as steal data and save credentials from Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers&#8217; user profiles. In addition, attackers can deploy an interactive command shell, which, theoretically, allows them to do almost anything with the victim&#8217;s computer.</p>
<p>Kaspersky experts studied the backdoor used by attackers as a part of final payload. According to their analysis, this backdoor, dubbed Gopuram, was employed mainly in attacks on cryptocurrencies related companies. Experts also suspect that, according to a number of clues, the Lazarus group was behind the attack. Details on the Gopuram backdoor, along with indicators of compromise, can be found <a href="https://securelist.com/gopuram-backdoor-deployed-through-3cx-supply-chain-attack/109344/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a post on the Securelist blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is this attack is especially dangerous?</h2>
<p>According to the BleepingComputer, the trojanized version of the program is signed with a legitimate 3CX Ltd. certificate issued by Sectigo and timestamped by DigiCert — the same certificate used in earlier versions of the 3CX program.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Objective-See, the macOS version of the malware isn&#8217;t only signed with a valid certificate, but also notarized by Apple! This means that the application is allowed to run on recent versions of macOS.</p>
<h2>How to stay safe</h2>
<p>The application&#8217;s developers recommend urgently uninstalling trojanized versions of the program using the VoIP web client until the update is released.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also wise to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident to make sure that attackers haven&#8217;t had time to take over your company&#8217;s computers. In general, in order to control what&#8217;s happening on the corporate network and to timely detect malicious activity, we recommend using <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/enterprise-security/managed-detection-and-response?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">Managed Detection and Response (MDR)-class</a> services.</p>

      <title>Microsoft will block e-mail from outdated Exchange servers</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Transport-based Enforcement System: Microsoft&#039;s mechanism to prevent mail delivery from outdated Exchange servers to Exchange Online.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outdated and completely unsupported versions of Exchange Servers pose an undeniable danger to corporate infrastructure and to mail flow. However, many administrators still believe in the proverb &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke — don&#8217;t fix it&#8221;, and prefer not to update Exchange unless absolutely necessary. And this appears to be why Microsoft decided to develop its transport-based enforcement System for Exchange Online.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this system is to notify administrators that they&#8217;re working with outdated and possibly unsafe software, and that, if they don&#8217;t subsequently update in a timely fashion, mail delivery from vulnerable servers will be gradually throttled and eventually blocked. It&#8217;s hoped that this system will serve as a convincing reason for administrators to finally upgrade or update Exchange Servers.</p>
<h2>How the transport-based enforcement system works</h2>
<p>The mechanism is quite simple: when Exchange Online receives mail from Exchange Server through an inbound OnPremises type connector, it identifies the server&#8217;s build version and evaluates if it&#8217;s safe to receive mail from it (i.e., whether the server&#8217;s version is supported and critical security patches are in place). If the server is vulnerable, then Exchange Online notes the date of its first encounter with it and adds a notification about an outdated server to the mail flow report, accessible by Exchange Server administrators.</p>
<p>If the situation doesn&#8217;t change within 30 days from the moment of initial discovery, Exchange Online will begin to throttle (in other words delay) messages from the vulnerable server. The throttling duration increases progressively every 10 days. If nothing changes 60 days after detection, Exchange Online begins to block the e-mails.</p>
<p>Initially, Microsoft plans to apply this system to Exchange 2007 servers only, but later the same approach will be applied to all versions of Exchange, and it doesn&#8217;t matter how the servers communicate with Exchange Online (that is, it won&#8217;t be limited to just OnPremises inbound connector). You can find additional details regarding the transport-based enforcement system in the official <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/throttling-and-blocking-email-from-persistently-vulnerable/ba-p/3762078" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Exchange team&#8217;s blog post</a>. Unfortunately, it lacks information on when this system will be launched and, most importantly, when it will extend its scope to other versions of Exchange servers.</p>
<h2>Why a transport-based enforcement system is important</h2>
<p>Implementation of such a system will be interesting as a precedent. Microsoft is rather aggressively demonstrating to its customers how highly it regards the importance of its cloud infrastructure security. It will be very interesting to see if this initiative turns into a trend — if other manufacturers of hybrid solutions (i.e., which run partly on a customer&#8217;s premises and partly in the cloud) follow Microsoft&#8217;s  example.</p>
<h2>How to ensure Microsoft Exchange servers&#8217; operability and secure e-mail flow?</h2>
<p>If you are still using an unsupported version of the Exchange platform, it&#8217;s probably time to upgrade. If you have an up-to-date version of the Exchange, you need to monitor the release of security patches and timely install them.</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend protecting Exchange servers and the mail delivered through them with the dedicated solution Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Exchange Server (included in <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/mail-server?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____ksms___" target="_blank">Kaspersky Security for Mail Server</a>). In addition, as the last few years have <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/exchange-vulnerabilities/38964/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a>n, attackers willingly exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange — sometimes creating exploits before users have a chance to install patches, and this can lead to rather serious consequences. But you can stay on top of things — controlling what&#8217;s happening in the corporate infrastructure and detecting malicious activity in time — with the help of <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/enterprise-security/managed-detection-and-response?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______" target="_blank">Managed Detection and Response</a>-class services.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 292 of the <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/podcast/" rel="noopener">Transatlantic Cable Podcast</a></em> is here! This week, the team talk about aggressive AI and how the DEA have turned Apple AirTags into a surveillance tool against criminals.</p>
<p>Moving on, the team discuss recent news that Nvidia&#8217;s CTO thinks that crypto-currencies don&#8217;t &#8220;bring anything useful for society&#8221; – pretty bold words for a business that sold GPU cards to crypto-miners just a few years ago.  To wrap up, discussion moves onto how the US is looking to block the use and sale of commercial spyware – however, there&#8217;s a pretty big catch.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Advice from the information security experts on the collection, storage and transfer of personally identifiable information (PII).]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Governments of many countries are tightening the laws that regulate working with personal data. At the same time, the number of data leaks is only growing from year to year. If around ten years ago the most severe financial losses a company could suffer tended to be lawsuits and consequences of reputational damage, these days it&#8217;s penalties from regulators that can account for a significant part of the company&#8217;s damages as a result of a data-loss incident. Therefore, we decided to publish a series of tips that will help you organize secure processes for collecting, storing and transferring personally identifiable information in your company.</p>
<h2>Personal-data collection</h2>
<p>The first most important thing: collect data only if you have sufficient legal grounds to do so. Data collection may be formally provided for by the law of the country in which your company operates; a contract with terms that clearly permit the processing of PII; or consent expressed by a PII subject in electronic or paper form. Besides:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep evidence of your obtaining consent for processing and storage of PII in case of legal claims or regulator&#8217;s inspections;</li>
<li>Do not collect data that&#8217;s not really needed for your work processes (data shouldn&#8217;t be collected &#8220;just in case&#8221;);</li>
<li>If data that&#8217;s not required for work is collected due to some mistake or misunderstanding, delete it immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal-data storage</h2>
<p>If you collect personal data, it&#8217;s very important that you know where it&#8217;s stored, who has access to it, and how it&#8217;s processed. To do this, you may need to create a kind of &#8220;map&#8221; where all processes related to PII are registered. Then, it&#8217;s wise to develop strict regulations for the storage and processing of data, and to constantly monitor the implementation of both. We also recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To store PII exclusively on media inaccessible to outsiders;</li>
<li>To limit access to PII to a minimal number of employees (it should only be available to those who really need it for business reasons);</li>
<li>To promptly delete personal data that&#8217;s no longer required for work processes;</li>
<li>If workflow requires storing paper documents, they should only be placed in secure locations (e.g., lockable safes);</li>
<li>Unnecessary paper documents should be destroyed using shredders;</li>
<li>If the data isn&#8217;t needed as it is, it should be anonymized (deprived of unique identifiers so that even in the event of a leak it would be impossible to identify the subject);</li>
<li>If, due to your work processes, it&#8217;s not possible to anonymize data, it needs to be pseudo-anonymized — to convert the PII into a unique string so that the identification of the subject is impossible without additional information;</li>
<li>To avoid storing PII on work devices and external or flash drives (they can be stolen or lost, and computer data can be accessed by an attacker);</li>
<li>Not to store or process real PII on test infrastructure;</li>
<li>Not to use new services for storing and processing data until you&#8217;re sure they meet basic security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal-data transfer</h2>
<p>All processes related to the transfer of personal data must be registered and approved by the security department, or data protection officer if you have one. All employees with access to PII should have clear instructions on how data should be handled in your company, which corporate or third-party services can be used for this, and to whom this data can be transferred. In addition, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subcontractors (for example, MSP services) don&#8217;t have access with administrator rights to systems containing PII;</li>
<li>Access to data is limited on an extraterritorial basis (data of citizens of one country should not be available from other countries unless cross-border data transder is not regulated);</li>
<li>When transferring PII, encryption is always used (this is especially important when sending data by e-mail);</li>
<li>When transferring personal data to third-party organizations, a data processing agreement (DPA) is signed;</li>
<li>You have the legal right to transfer PII to third parties (that is, there&#8217;s clear consent for this from the PII subject, or this is specified in a contract or required by law).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, neither these tips nor strict regulations can exclude the possibility of human error. Therefore, among other things, we recommend periodically conducting security awareness trainings. And it&#8217;s advisable to choose <a href="https://k-asap.com/en/?icid=gb_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder____kasap___" target="_blank">learning platforms</a> that have lessons related to privacy and working with personal data especially.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[How to recover sensitive information in a screenshot that was cropped or edited using Google Pixel Markup or Windows 11 Snipping Tool.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might think that hiding sensitive information in a picture is a cakewalk. Just blot out your secrets with a big black marker in any image editor. Or even better: just crop the bit of the photo or screenshot that contains your personal data. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Quite a lot, in fact. We&#8217;ve already posted about <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-to-leak-image-info/34875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how not to hide information in images</a> and <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-to-leak-info-from-docs/37362/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how not to retouch pictures embedded in documents</a>. But a recent study shows that you can still come a cropper, so to speak, even if you take just about every conceivable precaution — and all due to a bug related to image processing. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at how two standard image-editing tools — one on Google Pixel and the other in Windows 11 — can reveal supposedly hidden information in images.
</p>
<h2>How to recover hidden information in screenshots edited on Google Pixel</h2>
<p>
It all started when security researchers <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsSimonTime" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Simon Aarons</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/David3141593" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">David Buchanan</a> discovered a vulnerability they named <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsSimonTime/status/1636857478263750656" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Acropalypse</a>: it turns out that Markup, the Google Pixel built-in image editor, saves edited PNG files in a way that lets them be fully or partially recovered.</p>
<p>When processing PNG images, instead of saving a completely new PNG file, Markup overwrites the old one in a very peculiar way. If you crop a picture, its size in bytes compared to the original decreases, of course. The same thing happens if you paint over part of an image with a single color — thanks to the compression algorithms that are very good at packing solid-colored areas. But the file saved after editing in Markup has the same size as the original: the app simply overwrites the new data on top of the old, leaving a &#8220;tail&#8221; of the initial image data in the file. And with the help of a tool created by the researchers (<a href="https://acropalypse.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available online</a>), it&#8217;s possible to partially restore the original.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the researchers themselves illustrate what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<div id="attachment_47654" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/03/27154400/windows-11-google-pixel-image-editing-bug-01.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47654" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-47654" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/03/27154400/windows-11-google-pixel-image-editing-bug-01.png" alt="Illustration of the concept behind the Acropalypse vulnerability" width="2048" height="1152"></a><p id="caption-attachment-47654" class="wp-caption-text">Recovery of an image edited with Google Pixel Markup. <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsSimonTime/status/1636857478263750656" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a></p></div>
<p>Note, though, that the screenshot used as the example here is both <em>redacted AND cropped</em>. Thus, importantly, the resulting image is significantly smaller than the original. After the edited version is saved on top of the original, there&#8217;s a lot of non-overwritten data at the end of the file that can be recovered. And the fully unrestored or badly-restored area — the top third of the resulting picture — just so happens to contain nothing important.</p>
<p>So the researchers&#8217; demonstration should be taken as an ideal case: in real life, the success of the tool will almost certainly be lower, and the result will largely depend on the circumstances. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the problem can be ignored — this vulnerability is nothing if not very unpleasant.</p>
<p>It affects the following Google smartphones (highlighted are models that are no longer supported and will probably not get updates):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Pixel <strong>3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL</strong>
</li>
<li>Google Pixel <strong>4, 4 XL, 4a,</strong> 4a(5G)</li>
<li>Google Pixel 5, 5a</li>
<li>Google Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a</li>
<li>Google Pixel 7, 7 Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to its colloquial name, Acropalypse, the vulnerability was designated CVE-2023-21036. It has already been patched in the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2023-03-01" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">March Android update for the Pixel smartphones</a>. Alas, the update is powerless to fix old edited screenshots that have already been published or otherwise shared.
</p>
<h2>How to recover hidden information in screenshots edited in Windows 11</h2>
<p>
After Aarons and Buchanan posted their findings on Twitter, other researchers took up the cause. Logically assuming that other image-editing tools might use the same flawed mechanism for overwriting PNG files, they began to look for new vulnerable applications. And they found them, of course: a similar bug was <a href="https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1638222624084951040" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">detected</a> in Snipping Tool, a screenshot utility in Windows 11.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Snipping Tool has exactly the same problem: the app overwrites edited PNG files on top of the original, and when the new file is smaller, some data from the original remains at the end of the file, from which the uncut image can be partially reconstructed.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-snipping-tool-privacy-bug-exposes-cropped-image-content/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this article on BleepingComputer</a> for more details:</p>
<div id="attachment_47653" style="width: 1258px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/03/27154436/windows-11-google-pixel-image-editing-bug-02.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47653" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-47653" src="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2023/03/27154436/windows-11-google-pixel-image-editing-bug-02.jpg" alt="Acropalypse vulnerability in Windows 11 Snipping Tool" width="1248" height="2079"></a><p id="caption-attachment-47653" class="wp-caption-text">Recovery of an image edited with Windows 11 Snipping Tool. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-snipping-tool-privacy-bug-exposes-cropped-image-content/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a></p></div>
<p>Although in this case a smaller part of the original image was restored, the result is still impressive. Note that the problem seems to be confined only to Snipping Tool and only to the Windows 11 version. So users of earlier versions of Windows, or those who prefer to edit screenshots in Paint or a full-fledged graphics editor like Photoshop, aren&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p>The vulnerability in Windows 11 Snipping Tool remains unclosed. But, again, even when an update arrives, it won&#8217;t fix the problem with screenshots that are already out there.
</p>
<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>
If you use Windows 11 Snipping Tool, or have a Google Pixel smartphone (gen 3–7), and you&#8217;ve posted cropped or edited screenshots with passwords somewhere, consider those passwords compromised: change them immediately. Sure, you might struggle to remember every such instance, and in any case there&#8217;s nothing much you can do about it: there do exist <a href="https://github.com/infobyte/CVE-2023-21036" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Python scripts and YARA rules</a> for finding and treating such PNG images, but these are only for techies.</p>
<p>On a final note, here are some tips on how to safely retouch images with sensitive data that you plan to post online or send to someone you don&#8217;t know if you can fully trust:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you prefer to hide your secrets by painting over them or filling the area with solid color, make sure that the opacity is set to 100%.</li>
<li>If you opt for pixelating or smearing, bear in mind that this operation is <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/this-new-tool-can-retrieve-pixelated.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reversible</a>.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re cropping, save the image to a new file — preferably using Photoshop&#8217;s Save for Web tool or an equivalent: such a tool will definitely slice off the unwanted part of the file for the sake of optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lastly, before posting a picture that could spill a bean or two, ask yourself: is posting it really necessary?</p>
