<p>Interoperability will vastly increase the attack surface at every level in the stack ­ from the cryptography up through usability to commercial incentives and the opportunities for government interference.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea in theory, but will likely result in the overall security being the worst of each platform&#8217;s security.</p>

<p>The STAR Labs team (<a href="https://twitter.com/starlabs_sg">@starlabs_sg</a>) demoed a zero-day exploit chain targeting Microsoft&#8217;s SharePoint team collaboration platform that brought them a $100,000 reward and successfully hacked Ubuntu Desktop with a previously known exploit for $15,000.</p>
<p>Synacktiv (<a href="https://twitter.com/Synacktiv">@Synacktiv</a>) took home $100,000 and a Tesla Model 3 after successfully executing a TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) attack against the Tesla-Gateway in the Automotive category. They also used a TOCTOU zero-day vulnerability to escalate privileges on Apple macOS and earned $40,000.</p>
<p>Oracle VirtualBox was hacked using an OOB Read and a stacked-based buffer overflow exploit chain (worth $40,000) by Qrious Security&#8217;s Bien Pham (<a href="https://twitter.com/bienpnn">@bienpnn</a>).</p>
<p>Last but not least, Marcin Wiązowski elevated privileges on Windows 11 using an improper input validation zero-day that came with a $30,000 prize.</p></blockquote>
<p>The con&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-hacked-again-at-pwn2own-tesla-model-3-also-falls/">second</a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-ubuntu-and-vmware-workstation-hacked-on-last-day-of-pwn2own/">third</a> days were equally impressive.</p>
