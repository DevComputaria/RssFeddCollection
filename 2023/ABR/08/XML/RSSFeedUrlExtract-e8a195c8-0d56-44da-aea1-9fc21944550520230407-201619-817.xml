      <title>The Importance of Transparency – Fueling Trust and Security Through Communication</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/importance-transparency-fueling-trust-and-security-through</link>
      <description>Who needs to know ‘What,’ ‘When,’ and ‘How’ to tell them The Challenge There are many challenges to providing and maintaining cybersecurity in today’s connected world. While product developers increasingly consider security as they design and build products, they may not always communicate critical cybersecurity information about their connected products. Information gaps present a challenge to stakeholders—especially customers—who have limited insight into the security processes, functions and features that protect connected products, components, and services. Effective communication is the</description>

      <title>Phishing Resistance – Protecting the Keys to Your Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/phishing-resistance-protecting-keys-your-kingdom</link>
      <description>If you own a computer, watch the news, or spend virtually any time online these days you have probably heard the term “phishing.” Never in a positive context…and possibly because you have been a victim yourself. Phishing refers to a variety of attacks that are intended to convince you to forfeit sensitive data to an imposter. These attacks can take a number of different forms; from spear-phishing (which targets a specific individual within an organization), to whaling (which goes one step further and targets senior executives or leaders). Furthermore, phishing attacks take place over multiple</description>

      <title>Data Analytics for Small Businesses: How to Manage Privacy Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/data-analytics-small-businesses-how-manage-privacy-risks</link>
      <description>Perhaps you’ve been hearing about data analytics, which is being promoted as a way for even small businesses to analyze communications with customers, enhance customer experience, save money, and ultimately improve your brand. However, data analytics can have big privacy implications. You may think of managing privacy risk as protecting sensitive customer information, such as credit cards. As the Venn diagram to the right demonstrates, data security is certainly one aspect of privacy risk, but privacy risks can also arise by means unrelated to cybersecurity incidents. People can experience</description>

      <title>Why Employers Should Embrace Competency-Based Learning in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/why-employers-should-embrace-competency-based-learning-cybersecurity</link>
      <description>There is a growing movement toward increasing the use of competency and skills-based education and hiring practices in both the public and private sectors. For example, the Executive Order on Modernizing and Reforming the Assessment and Hiring of Federal Job Candidates calls upon the Federal Government to “ensure that the individuals most capable of performing the roles and responsibilities required of a specific position are those hired for that position”—resulting in “merit-based reforms that will replace degree-based hiring with skills- and competency-based hiring.” Similarly, the</description>

      <title>Our Quest: Advancing Product Labels to Help Consumers Consider Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/our-quest-advancing-product-labels-help-consumers-consider</link>
      <description>For many decades, consumers have relied on labels to help them make decisions about which products to buy. Sometimes the labels make assertions about what ingredients or components the product uses. (What’s in that peanut butter?) Other times labels claim a level of performance. (How much storage does that laptop have?) These statements may come from the manufacturer or from a third party who has reviewed and perhaps tested the product. (This appliance has been tested to meet specific electrical safety standards) Labels have assisted manufacturers and retailers to help consumers make more</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy: Future Work &amp;amp; Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/differential-privacy-future-work-open-challenges</link>
      <description>In this series of blog posts, we have tried to give an accessible overview of the state-of-the-art in differential privacy. In this final post, we review some of the open challenges in the practical use of differential privacy, and conclude with a summary of contexts where differential privacy is already ready for deployment and what comes next. Setting the Privacy Parameter The impact of the privacy parameter (or privacy budget) ε has been a consistent theme throughout this series. Conceptually, the privacy parameter is simple: smaller values of ε yield better privacy, and larger values yield</description>

      <title>Utility Metrics for Differential Privacy: No One-Size-Fits-All</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/utility-metrics-differential-privacy-no-one-size-fits-all</link>
      <description>In previous posts we discussed different ways to implement differential privacy, each of which offers some trade-off between privacy and utility. But what does “utility” mean, and how do we know we are preserving it? To discuss this topic, we are delighted to introduce another guest author in our blog series, Claire McKay Bowen, Lead Data Scientist for Privacy and Data Security at the Urban Institute. Claire’s research focuses on assessing the quality of differentially private data synthesis methods and science communication.

      <title>Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography to Complement Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/privacy-enhancing-cryptography-complement-differential-privacy</link>
      <description>In previous posts we discussed many aspects of differential privacy: what it is, what it is useful for, and how it is applied to data analysis problems. All of those ideas can be applied once you get your hands on a whole dataset. What if the data you are interested in extracting insights from belongs to mutually distrusting organizations? For example, say you run a pumpkin spice latte stand and are wondering if your pumpkin spice supplier is overcharging you compared to the industry-wide average. You are willing to participate in a study that computes this average, but not comfortable giving</description>
