<html><body><p>Organizations face many challenges regarding cybersecurity, including keeping up with the ever-evolving threat landscape and complying with regulatory requirements. In addition, the cybersecurity skill shortage makes it more difficult for organizations to adequately staff their risk and compliance functions. According to the <a href="https://www.isc2.org//-/media/ISC2/Research/2022-WorkForce-Study/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"  target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >(ISC)2 2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>, the global cybersecurity workforce gap has increased by 26.2%, with 3.4 million more workers needed to secure assets effectively.</p>
<p>Organizations must employ technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), collaboration tools and analytics to cope with the situation efficiently. To that end, ChatGPT can be an enabler for organizational governance, risk and compliance (GRC) functions.</p>
<h2><b>ChatGPT Addresses Typical GRC Use Cases</b></h2>
<p>A significant advancement in natural language processing (NLP) technologies has allowed for more accurate and nuanced language analysis, leading to better and more reliable insights. By leveraging the power of NLP technology, ChatGPT, the AI-based chatbot developed by OpenAI, can generate coherent and relevant responses to a wide range of questions and topics. Some reasons for ChatGPT&rsquo;s popularity include the ability to understand human language and context, tailor responses based on previous conversations and retrieve vast amounts of information. ChatGPT is powered by GPT-3.5-turbo, OpenAI&rsquo;s most advanced language model. OpenAI has also developed various language models with different capabilities and use cases, like Codex, DALL-E, Ada and Davinci.</p>
<p>With ChatGPT, GRC analysts have a valuable tool to use in navigating the world of risk and compliance. Let&rsquo;s explore some of the GRC use cases ChatGPT can address.</p>
<h2><b>Generate Framework, Policy and Procedure Documents</b></h2>
<p>GRC analysts can use ChatGPT to generate draft policy or procedure documents by supplying basic information and guidelines. It can then use its NLP capabilities to create a coherent, well-structured document that meets the company&rsquo;s GRC management requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, GRC analysts can use it to evaluate policy and procedure documents by inputting a completed document into the model. Analyzing policy documents, providing feedback on effectiveness and highlighting areas that might require revision can also support the analyst.</p>
<p>Using ChatGPT for policy and procedure document creation and evaluation saves GRC analysts time while improving the overall quality of the documents.</p>
<p>But while ChatGPT can create the initial draft, analysts must use human judgment and expertise to evaluate and refine it to ensure that the information is appropriate for the company&rsquo;s specific needs and complies with all relevant regulations and standards.</p>
<h2><b>Manage Regulatory Compliance</b></h2>
<p>ChatGPT can be a valuable tool to help GRC analysts manage compliance and minimize the risk of fines and penalties. Recently, Meta <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/global/meta-fined-eu-data-privacy-violation-targeted-ads-1235479011/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"  target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >was hit</a> with $414 million in fines by the European Union&rsquo;s leading privacy watchdog. While traditional methods of managing compliance may still be in use, they may not be able to keep up with the rapidly changing regulatory landscape. Hence, ChatGPT is valuable for the following use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help by reviewing and analyzing vast amounts of data from agencies worldwide. It can filter the data, find the specific requirements applicable to the organization/sector/geography and assess gaps in the existing processes to provide recommendations. This systematic approach can give the organization confidence in its approach to monitoring and maintaining regulatory requirements. For example, an IT organization complying with environmental, social and governance (ESG) regulations can leverage the technology for detailed insight related to the EU&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Directive for data centers or addressing modern slavery and human trafficking disclosure requirements under the UK&rsquo;s Modern Slavery Act.</li>
<li>It can analyze compliance-related communications, such as articles, regulatory filings, emails and chat messages, for potential compliance risks. The model could be trained to detect keywords that indicate potential compliance issues and flag them for further review. However, ChatGPT is a chatbot, not a regulatory compliance tool. While it can analyze and understand text data related to compliance and regulation, it cannot actively monitor a company&rsquo;s compliance or regulatory status.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Enhance Risk Assessment</b></h2>
<p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s vast knowledge of various industries and risk data should be leveraged to identify relevant risk factors. Risk managers can share information, such as incident reports, audit reports and regulatory filings, to identify potential risks. Analyzing this information will help the risk manager evaluate the risk&rsquo;s impact quickly and accurately. For example, ChatGPT could be trained to analyze social media posts related to customer complaints to identify common patterns. It could then assess the likelihood and potential impact of those complaints on the company&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>The platform can also generate risk assessment reports that identify potential risks and provide recommendations for mitigation.</p>
<p>As an AI language model, ChatGPT can also potentially identify risks from network architecture diagrams. It may not be able to analyze the diagram itself, as it is an image, not text. Still, it can analyze textual descriptions and labels within a network architecture diagram to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2><b>Improve Fraud Detection</b></h2>
<p>Fraud is a significant risk for most organizations and is difficult to detect, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. ChatGPT could help process text data looking for potential fraud. A few examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emails: </strong>By analyzing emails, companies can identify patterns of communication that may indicate fraud, such as employees communicating with known fraudulent actors or discussing fraudulent activities.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media: </strong>Social media platforms can be a rich data source for detecting potential fraud. By analyzing social media posts and activity, companies can identify individuals or groups that may be engaging in fraudulent activity and patterns of behavior or language that may be associated with fraud.</li>
<li><strong>Invoices:</strong> Analyzing invoice data helps companies identify suspicious patterns, such as duplicate invoices or invoices from unknown vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Documentation: </strong>Compliance documentation, such as audit reports and certifications, can help identify potential fraud or noncompliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, text data analysis alone is insufficient for comprehensive fraud detection. It is most effective in conjunction with other fraud detection methods, such as data analytics and human expertise.</p>
<h2><b>Support Third-Party Assessment Program</b></h2>
<p>An analyst can leverage ChatGPT for a range of activities in a third-party assessment program:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be trained to provide guidance on assessment criteria and assist third-party assessors in understanding specific assessment requirements. It can provide information on industry best practices for security and compliance, including frameworks such as SOC 2, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</li>
<li>The model can analyze assessment data and identify patterns or trends, like analysis of third-party survey responses or audit findings, to identify common themes or areas where the organization may need to improve its compliance program.</li>
<li>It can conduct risk assessments based on specific criteria, such as risk factors related to a particular industry or region. This can help third-party assessors identify potential risks and provide guidance on implementing security controls to mitigate them.</li>
<li>It can provide ongoing education and training for third-party assessors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Conduct Training and Awareness</b></h2>
<p>With ChatGPT, companies can provide analysts with a more engaging and personalized training experience tailored to their specific needs. The company could create a platform-based compliance training chatbot with which employees and analysts can interact using natural language. The chatbot could be trained on the company&rsquo;s specific compliance policies, procedures and regulatory requirements. This can help improve employee engagement and retention of key compliance concepts while reducing the risk of non-compliance and regulatory violations.</p>
<p>There are many other use cases where GRC professionals can benefit from using ChatGPT. Though the platform provides a wealth of information on security and compliance topics, it is not a substitute for working with qualified professionals, such as auditors, security consultants and legal advisors. Also, the use of ChatGPT and training other OpenAI models come with data privacy risks. Security experts must properly evaluate and mitigate these to take full advantage of ChatGPT.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>The hacker group Lapsus$ (sometimes referred to as LAPSUS$ or simply Lapsus) is a relatively newer organization in the cyber arena. The group began to garner public attention in December 2021 after some successful attacks on major corporations, where even the Department of Homeland Security felt it necessary to spend more time researching this group <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/12/02/cyber-safety-review-board-conduct-second-review-lapsus" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >through the Cyber Safety Review Board</a> (CSRB).</p>
<p>For reference, Lapsus$ is sometimes also referred to as the criminal organization DEV-0537 and appears to have operated primarily using a private Telegram channel. And <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60953527" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >in April</a>, law enforcement arrested seven people in the U.K., where a 16- and 17-year-old faced charges in relation to the attacks.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Lapsus$ has been accused of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3669869/what-happened-to-the-lapsus-hackers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >bold and illogical</a>&rdquo; tactics while still successfully attacking some of the world&rsquo;s largest companies. Pinning the group down has also proved more difficult than expected, despite being dormant since the arrests. Lapsus$ is likely loosely knit and motivated by money, clout and notoriety. They often even <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-nvidia-samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >used polls</a> to determine their next move.</p>
<p>Therefore, keep in mind that &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; does not always mean complex, hyper-focused strategy or intricately planned work. Sometimes, the sophistication comes in the form of obfuscation and lack of any clear structure. Think of decentralization and chaos theory, and remember this nuance as you examine the group.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at some of Lapsus$&rsquo;s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and highlight some of their known behaviors.</p>
<h2>Not Necessarily a Ransomware Group</h2>
<p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs are admittedly still limited, but Lapsus$ developed a reputation for notoriety, using what some industry analysts call a different level of sophistication and unconventional means. Ransomware or not, the group definitively aims to exploit <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/ransomware-attacks-2021-information-meets-emotion/" >emotive responses from victims</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the more novel techniques by the group is the active recruitment of insiders, specifically at &ldquo;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >major mobile phone providers, large software and gaming companies, hosting firms and call centers</a>.&rdquo; The interesting approach here is not without precedent in the pre-cyber world. If you want to increase your chances of a successful crime, turn potential victims into partners. Keep in mind the larger <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/organizational-resilience-geopolitical-socio-economic-trends-threats/" >socio-economic pressures</a> of a worsening economy, and incentives only grow.</p>
<p>This is a modern-day challenge for cyber defenders. It&rsquo;s no longer enough to just protect against technical security challenges. You have to manage the expectations of personnel and be on heightened alert for insiders, who may not even be disgruntled but are looking for means to fill the gaps caused by economic hardship.</p>
<h2>Causing Damage from Within</h2>
<p>Unlike ransomware groups who seek to encrypt and extort using malicious software, Lapsus$&rsquo;s approach goes back to good old fashion tricks: exploit humans. Once a target has been successfully recruited or credentials are compromised, we have seen that Lapsus$ has deployed powerful remote access software to do their damage from within.</p>
<p>After establishing a foothold, the group begins its reconnaissance. This involves mapping out paths through Active Directory, seeking opportunities for lateral movement and gaining escalated privileges; all the expected moves you would expect a malicious actor to use. Once successful, an attacker can lock out legitimate users and compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Similarly, once these privileges have been established and accounts compromised, a group like Lapsus$ can traverse over the organization&rsquo;s virtual private network (VPN), appearing as any other legitimate user.</p>
<p>How would a group gain this type of access? Some methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned, entice insiders, including business partners or suppliers that may have third-party access. Acquiring their credentials gives perceived legitimate access.</li>
<li>Old-fashioned reconnaissance on both the open and dark web to see if active credentials are still available for use. This includes working with other underground/dark web groups to purchase or lease working credentials.</li>
<li>Passwords stealers and unauthorized access of session tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, so many of these methods go back to <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/social-engineering-threats-against-cybersecurity-experts/" >social engineering</a>. As technical controls improve and emerging technologies such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/artificial-intelligence" >artificial intelligence</a> gain wider adoption, cyber defenders should not be surprised that malicious actors are going &ldquo;old school&rdquo; and &ldquo;low tech&rdquo; in their TTP approach. Old tricks work.</p>
<h2>With So Little Known, What Comes Next?</h2>
<p>Curious minds in the industry would certainly be keen to learn the results of the CSRB study. Examining some of the Lapsus$ Telegram exchanges with victim companies almost has a troll-like feeling to them. So until we learn more about the group, what are some protective steps organizations can take?</p>
<p>Do not neglect the basics. With all the new gadgetry, it is easy to forget that a <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/creating-culture-cybersecurity-at-work/" >strong cybersecurity culture is still your best defender</a>. What did we learn from the Lapsus$ attacks, which have gone relatively dormant since the arrests? That &ldquo;hacking the human&rdquo; still produces results. <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/organizational-resilience-insider-threats/" >Money, ideology, compromise and ego</a>; all of these can chew away at your best people.</p>
<p>Appropriate access. Access management is not only about <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/modern-identity-access-management/" >identity</a> and <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/when-digital-identity-and-access-management-meets-physical-security/" >physical</a> access; it is also about <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/how-privileged-access-management-fits-layered-security-strategy/" >privileges</a>. Depending on your architectural structure, the right privileges could grant unfettered access across the entire estate. This begs two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you &ldquo;over granting&rdquo; privileges to persons and groups? There must be a business and security case for privileges, all managed through a <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-management-building-fort-around-worlds-most-valuable-currency/" >risk acceptance policy</a>, procedure and register.</li>
<li>Does your system and data configuration allow unfettered access with the right credentials?&nbsp;In other words, if you have not appropriately segmented your network and segregated your data, you either have to accept the associated risks or, candidly, invest and make it right.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Plan for Future Attacks</h2>
<p>In closing, Lapsus$ will not be the last group to exploit human flaws through a flurry of techniques in order to damage organizations. Unless we are ready to give ourselves up to the machines &mdash;&nbsp;not advised &mdash; we must look beyond technological controls. People must know the security risks and be treated in a manner where there is no incentive for compromise. And finally, security professionals must establish processes that users only access what they really need. With this approach, even if you do get popped, you can at least limit the blast radius.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>The last decade has seen an explosion of IoT devices across a multitude of industries. With that rise has come the need for centralized systems to perform data collection and device management, commonly called IoT Platforms. One such platform, ThingsBoard, was the recent subject of research by IBM Security X-Force.</p>
<p>While there has been a lot of discussion around the security of IoT devices themselves, there is far less conversation around the security of the platforms these devices connect with. This research was undertaken to start those conversations and encourage further interest.</p>
<p>ThingsBoard is an open source IoT platform designed with the intention of supporting as many different types of IoT devices as possible. Founded in 2016, this Ukraine-based organization quickly rose in popularity amongst both IoT enthusiasts and industry professionals. With thousands of active deployments ranging from small IoT developments to city infrastructure monitoring and management, ThingsBoard is one of the more popular open-source IoT platform solutions.</p>
<p>As a result of this project, a vulnerability involving insecure secret key management was discovered. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-26462, can be leveraged to escalate privileges within the system, using the secret key to manipulate the JSON Web Tokens underpinning the authentication system for the platform.</p>
<h2>JSON Web Tokens</h2>
<p>Before diving into the details of what the research found, a brief overview of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is in order. JWTs have become increasingly popular as a means of providing secure, stateless authentication for web and mobile applications. They are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. There are three sections that make up the JWT: header, payload, and signature.</p>
<p><amp-img src="https://images-cdn.welcomesoftware.com/Zz02ZTZmZTFjYWNmZmMxMWVkODY3ZDhhN2NiZWU2ODg0Mw==?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOlsiNmU2ZmUxY2FjZmZjMTFlZDg2N2Q4YTdjYmVlNjg4NDMiXSwiZXhwIjoxNjgwNzIzMjcyfQ.R_xf86oAtfWPZVWX62k8oh0O_l0Q0ZYCi1pRgnrulxw" layout="intrinsic" class="" alt="IoT Platform_1.png" width="700" height="350" lightbox="lightbox"></amp-img></p>
<p>The JWT header contains metadata about the token, such as the encoding method. The payload contains the claims that are being transmitted, such as the User ID, role, and token lifetime. Lastly, the signature is a cryptographic signature used to verify that the contents of the payload are valid and have not been tampered with. This signature is generated using the algorithm specified in the header of the JWT and a secret key that resides on the server.</p>
<p>Protection of this key is critical. Unauthorized access to the key allows for arbitrary modification of claims stored within the payload, which in turn opens the door for unintended use. We will see an example of this in the IoT platform that was the subject of the research, ThingsBoard.</p>
<h2>ThingsBoard</h2>
<p>Like many web applications, ThingsBoard makes use of JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and authorization. These tokens identify the user account and define what tenants that user can access. It is intended that these claims about the user are set by the server which assigns the token and are then protected from tempering through the inclusion of the digital signature. If the signature is valid, any claims included in the payload will be assumed valid and therefore trusted by the server. In cases where a strong secret key is used, this system is generally secure.</p>
<p>However, during a review of the <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >ThingsBoard source code</a>, a static default secret key was discovered.</p>
<p><amp-img src="https://images-cdn.welcomesoftware.com/Zz0yYjMwODUzY2QzZDQxMWVkYTg3OGMyY2Y3YzQ3MGNjZQ==?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOlsiMmIzMDg1M2NkM2Q0MTFlZGE4NzhjMmNmN2M0NzBjY2UiXSwiZXhwIjoxNjgwNzIzMjcyfQ.SewsFDola__AQzook-kx_aIIHVIPbngRZd776v5oXDM" layout="intrinsic" class="" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 12.05.59 PM.png" width="720" height="191.48014440433212" lightbox="lightbox"></amp-img></p>
<p>Using this key, it is possible to re-sign JWTs that have been modified, before sending them back to the server for validation. The signature will appear to be valid, as it was generated using the correct key, and thus the server will trust the claims made in the payload. One such claim made in the ThingsBoard platform is the role of the logged-in user account.</p>

<p>By editing this role value and generating a new, valid signature for the payload, a user can escalate privileges within the platform to the highest level. This grants access throughout the entirety of the platform, including other tenants, users, and devices not affiliated with the original account.<amp-img src="https://images-cdn.welcomesoftware.com/Zz1mNmU3YmZjMGQzZDMxMWVkYWMzY2MyY2Y3YzQ3MGNjZQ==?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOlsiZjZlN2JmYzBkM2QzMTFlZGFjM2NjMmNmN2M0NzBjY2UiXSwiZXhwIjoxNjgwNzIzMjcyfQ.9OU_Cprc3Qn0CcVy1R8KkqkGWGQl-BzxNfZKlUjAvrw" layout="intrinsic" class="" alt="IoT_5.png" width="720" height="220" lightbox="lightbox"></amp-img><amp-img src="https://images-cdn.welcomesoftware.com/Zz1mZDI0NzY5ZWQzZDMxMWVkOTQwNmFlZTRhN2M2MWJjZg==?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOlsiZmQyNDc2OWVkM2QzMTFlZDk0MDZhZWU0YTdjNjFiY2YiXSwiZXhwIjoxNjgwNzIzMjcyfQ.t7U-6htME-Y2KeRwYqCDmhCjmm0Yknpgu5W6EMVRD7g" layout="intrinsic" class="" alt="IoT_6.png" width="720" height="246" lightbox="lightbox"></amp-img></p>
<p>Because ThingsBoard allowed the default key to be used without requiring administrators to change it, and because that default key was also exposed publicly in the configuration files, the door was opened for attackers to gain unauthorized access in excess of what is intended.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IBM X-Force has brought this issue to the attention of the developers, and as of ThingsBoard version 3.4.2 a new system has been implemented. Rather than using a hardcoded default key, ThingsBoard will now generate a random secret key for new deployments and upgrades. There is no patch for earlier versions, so an update to version 3.4.2+ is recommended.</p>
<p>On existing deployments where updating may be a lengthy process, administrators are encouraged to check the secret key and ensure that it has not been left as the default string. This can be done either directly through the <a href="https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/blob/master/application/src/main/resources/thingsboard.yml#L114" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >configuration file</a>&nbsp;or through the System Administrator dashboard.</p>

<p>ThingsBoard is just one among many IoT Platforms which, much like the devices that connect to them, all deserve further research and scrutiny. Adoption of IoT devices in all industries will only continue to grow, and with it the need to ensure security in the platforms managing devices and collecting data. The conversation has been started, what will you do to be a part of it?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>On February 14, 2023, a Russian national and owner of Moscow cybersecurity firm M-13 was<a > found guilty of wire fraud</a>, securities fraud and conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computers.</p>
<p>Vladislav Klyushin was charged along with four other men &mdash; Ivan Yermakov, Nikolai Rumiantcev, Mikhail Irzak and Igor Sladkov. However, Klyushin was the only one arrested and extradited to the United States, while the others remain at large.</p>
<p>The Kremlin-connected businessman&rsquo;s scheme focused on insider trading. By obtaining and using information not known to the general public, it&rsquo;s estimated that Klyushin and his co-conspirators made <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-businessman-made-millions-insider-trading-through-hacking-us-says-2021-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >more than $80 million</a>.</p>
<p>But how exactly did this happen? How did the group break digital locks to capture critical information and gain a stock market advantage? Here&rsquo;s a look at how malicious actors started insider trading, and what it means for organizations.</p>
<h2>How Did Threat Actors Make This Happen?</h2>
<p>This insider attack effort began in 2018 when authorities say Ivan Yermakov &mdash; an employee of M-13 and a Russian intelligence agent charged with interfering in the 2016 U.S. election &mdash; hacked into the computer systems of two vendors used by large companies to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Using the information in reports not yet available to the public, Klyushin and his associates made stock purchases that generated ongoing revenue and minimized potential losses. For example, if quarterly reports showed an uptick in corporate profitability, malicious actors bought stock at a lower price and reaped the benefits as share prices increased once reports went public. This information also helped them avoid the natural downturns that come with stock market investing. If annual reports highlighted revenue loss leading to staff cuts, attackers could cut their losses by selling early at higher prices.</p>
<p>The group placed trades both for themselves and took a cut of the profits to place similar trades for clients.</p>
<h2>What Do These Insider Issues Mean for Organizations?</h2>
<p>For organizations, this insider attack highlights three critical issues: Third-party risk, financial damage and the misuse of specialized knowledge.</p>
<h4><strong>Third-Party Risk</strong></h4>
<p>The insider trading group didn&rsquo;t go after corporate systems to obtain internal data. Instead, they targeted trusted third parties used by organizations to help complete and file quarterly and annual reports. What&rsquo;s more, they didn&rsquo;t take this data to destroy or sell it. Instead, they used it to generate returns on publicly traded markets.</p>
<p>This creates a new concern for businesses, where multiple degrees of separation exist between stolen data and significant outcomes. Consider a scenario where attackers breach an SEC-filing organization while avoiding detection. Malicious actors could spend months quietly viewing quarterly and annual reports, then using that data to generate steady gains in the stock market. If attackers are careful, they could make it seem as though these transactions were merely smart investment strategies rather than the result of stolen data.</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Damage</strong></h4>
<p>While low-volume, individual stock trades using insider knowledge pose minimal risk to organizations, larger-scale efforts could have serious financial consequences.</p>
<p>Consider a company reporting a less-than-stellar fourth quarter to the SEC. If attackers compromise this information and use it to inform trades worth millions or tens of millions, the resulting panic and share sell-off could cause stock prices to artificially plummet ahead of revenue announcements. Once SEC reports are published, stocks may sink even further as worries about the company&rsquo;s financial state intensify.</p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, enterprises see their stock value suddenly drop and then slowly climb back toward the mean. In the worst-case scenario, sudden sell-offs could lead to staff cuts, reputation damage and even business closure.</p>
<h4><strong>Specialized Knowledge</strong></h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an additional concern around the use of specialized knowledge to empower these attacks.</p>
<p>Klyushin and his accomplices weren&rsquo;t simply criminals. They were criminals with in-depth cybersecurity knowledge thanks to their work in the IT security sector. This experience gave them access to both specialized knowledge and a greater understanding of standard security policies. For example, they could access those used to govern relationships with third parties. Equipped with this information, attackers were better able to circumvent detection tools and access data unnoticed.</p>
<h2>Where Can Companies Improve Protective Processes?</h2>
<p>When it comes to improving defense against potential insider trading, it all starts and ends with third parties. A three-pronged approach can help reduce total risk.</p>
<p>First, companies need to vet both current and prospective vendors and partners. This vetting includes an assessment of existing security controls and policies, an examination of any past breaches and their cause and the creation of service-level agreements that lay out vendor and client responsibilities in the event of a breach.</p>
<p>Next is threat assessment: Understanding where current vendor policies and frameworks may put companies at risk. For example, organizations must ensure that data at rest, in transit and in use is effectively encrypted. Otherwise, they may open themselves up to potential compromise. Partner security practices also play a role in this assessment. Do vendor staff have the training to recognize and respond to potential threat vectors?</p>
<p>Finally, companies must deploy tools capable of monitoring security risk at all points along the digital value chain. This approach provides the visibility needed to identify potential threats and take action before a compromise occurs.</p>
<h2>Brokering Bad</h2>
<p>By stealing data and acting as brokers for bad-faith actors, Russian threat actors were able to not only compromise the financial data of large enterprises but leverage this information to line their pockets and those of their associates.</p>
<p>This move away from more traditional smash-and-grab tactics speaks to an evolving threat landscape, one that focuses on quietly leveraging stolen data rather than trying to sell it for profit or hold it for ransom.</p>
<p>The result is a renewed need for corporate focus on third-party protection: Better vendor evaluations, improved threat assessments and increased visibility of third-party services can help companies close the door on insider trading.</p>

<html><body><p>The days when email was the main vector for phishing attacks are long gone. Now, phishing attacks occur on SMS, voice, social media and messaging apps. They also hide behind trusted services like Azure and AWS. And with the expansion of cloud computing, even more Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based phishing schemes are possible.</p>
<p>Phishing tactics have evolved faster than ever, and the variety of attacks continues to grow. Security pros need to be aware.</p>
<h2>SaaS to SaaS Phishing</h2>
<p>Instead of building phishing pages from scratch, cyber criminals are increasingly turning to established SaaS platforms to execute their malware schemes. By utilizing legitimate domains to host their phishing campaigns, it&rsquo;s more challenging for detection engines to identify them. And since SaaS platforms require minimal technical expertise, it&rsquo;s easier for novice hackers to launch attacks.</p>
<p>The number of phishing URLs hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms has increased at an alarming rate. From June 2021 through June 2022, the rate of newly detected phishing URLs hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms has increased by over 1100%, according to <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/platform-abuse-phishing/?ref=hackernoon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Palo Alto&rsquo;s Unit 42</a>.</p>
<p>Cyber criminals take advantage of cloud-based SaaS platforms to launch phishing attacks without ever needing to access the victims&rsquo; on-premises computers or networks, as HackerNoon cyber expert <a href="https://hackernoon.com/cloud-phishing-new-tricks-and-the-crown-jewel" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Zen Chan</a> points out. Chan says that SaaS-based phishing makes it difficult for traditional security measures, such as anti-spam gateways, sandboxing and URL filtering, to detect and flag these malicious activities. With the increasing use of cloud-based office productivity and collaboration tools, attackers can now easily host and share malicious documents, files and malware on reputable domains.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the problem becomes clear when we consider that malicious downloads might originate from platforms such as Google Drive or DropBox. In these places, malware is easy to disguise as a picture, invoice image, PDF or important work file. The problem is that in cloud storage, the files are encrypted, which enables security tool evasion. And the malicious files are only decrypted on the victim&rsquo;s machine, as explained by <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/threat-actors-migrating-to-the-cloud/?ref=hackernoon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >CheckPoint</a> researchers.</p>
<p>Examples of SaaS platforms used in phishing campaigns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>File sharing</li>
<li>Form builders</li>
<li>Website builders</li>
<li>Note-taking/collaboration tools</li>
<li>Design/prototyping/wireframe</li>
<li>Personal branding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phishing Leveraging Azure</h2>
<p>In a recent report, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/26/evolved-phishing-device-registration-trick-adds-to-phishers-toolbox-for-victims-without-mfa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Microsoft&rsquo;s threat analysts</a> detected another type of sophisticated phishing scheme. This campaign employed compromised login information to enroll rogue devices on a targeted network. The infiltrated devices were then utilized to propagate phishing emails. It appears the attacks were successful primarily on accounts that lacked <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication" >MFA security</a>, making them more vulnerable to takeover.</p>
<p>The attackers employed a DocuSign-themed email tactic, which lured recipients to click on a link to review and sign a document, thereby exposing their login information.</p>
<p><amp-img src="https://images-cdn.welcomesoftware.com/Zz1hMDJmMjFjMjkyY2ExMWVkOTVmM2UyZGE3ZTliZTFkZA==?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOlsiYTAyZjIxYzI5MmNhMTFlZDk1ZjNlMmRhN2U5YmUxZGQiXSwiZXhwIjoxNjc0NjA1MjE4fQ.zjjJceQRPkN739ykb4YnAKJ4xIS75FTZ8ddQltciOEo" layout="intrinsic" class="" alt="" width="624" height="441" lightbox="lightbox"></amp-img></p>
<p><em>Source: Microsoft</em></p>
<p>Actors utilized embedded links in the fake DocuSign emails that directed victims to a phishing website. These mimicked the Office 365 login page, complete with pre-filled usernames for added credibility.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s telemetry data revealed that the initial attacks focused on firms in Australia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. It appears that the actors were primarily targeting remote workers, as well as poorly protected managed service points and other infrastructure that may operate outside strict security protocols.</p>
<h2>The Next Stage of the Attack</h2>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s security team was able to detect the threat by identifying unusual patterns in the creation of inbox rules. Attackers added these rules immediately after gaining control of an inbox. Apparently, the attackers had compromised over a hundred mailboxes across multiple organizations, using malicious mailbox rules named &ldquo;Spam Filter&rdquo;. This enabled actors to maintain control over the compromised mailboxes and use them for phishing and other malicious activities.</p>
<p>Using the stolen credentials, the intruders were able to gain access to the victim&rsquo;s email account by installing Outlook on their own machine and logging in using the compromised credentials. From there, the attacker&rsquo;s device automatically connected to the company&rsquo;s Azure Active Directory due to the acceptance of Outlook&rsquo;s first launch experience. Microsoft points out that an MFA policy in Azure AD would have prevented this rogue registration from occurring.</p>
<p>Once the attacker&rsquo;s device accessed the victim&rsquo;s network, the intruders began the second phase of their campaign. They sent phishing emails to employees of the targeted firm, as well as external targets such as contractors, suppliers or partners. As these phishing messages originate from within a trusted workspace, they carry an element of legitimacy, and security solutions are less likely to flag them.</p>
<h2>Phishing Leveraging Amazon Web Services</h2>
<p>Cyber criminals are also using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to bypass automated security scanners and launch phishing attacks, as per <a href="https://www.avanan.com/blog/hackers-build-phishing-pages-using-aws-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Avanan</a>. Actors have leveraged the ability to use an AWS service to create and host web pages using WordPress or custom code. From there, they can send phishing messages that carry the AWS name to corporate email systems. This enables the emails to evade scanners that would typically block such messages and adds an extra layer of legitimacy to deceive victims.</p>
<p>Another recently highlighted <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/22/aws_cloud_phishing/?ref=hackernoon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >phishing campaign</a> leverages AWS and employs unusual syntax construction in the messages to evade scanners. Email services that rely on static Allow or Block Lists to secure email content are not immune to these attacks. These services evaluate whether a website is safe or not. But Amazon Web Services is too large and prevalent to block, so scanners will always mark it as safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for attackers to piggyback on well-known brand names for phishing campaigns. Avanan has reported that attackers have used QuickBooks, PayPal and Google Docs to increase the chances of their messages landing in the inbox.</p>
<h2>Phishing With QR Codes</h2>
<p>Last but not least, Zen Chan also shed light on another type of phishing attack called QRishing. These attacks embed malware links in QR codes included in emails. This makes them difficult to detect for most email security solutions. QRishing can also potentially lead victims to connect to an unsecured WiFi network, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information.</p>
<p>Today, people use QR codes to access menus, check-in for health services and access public or organizational information. But rogue QR codes are also on the rise. Criminals can even print <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hidden-scams-in-malicious-scans-how-to-use-qr-codes-safely" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >malicious QR codes</a> on a sticker to overlay legitimate QR codes.</p>
<p>To make things even more complex, attackers are using social engineering tactics by inserting fake QR codes into phishing text messages (SMishing plus QRishing) or social media platforms. When scanned, these infected codes redirect victims to phishing sites, where they may be prompted to enter login credentials which can then be stolen by the attackers.</p>
<h2>No End to Phishing in Sight</h2>
<p>The phishing attack frenzy does not appear to be letting up soon. Hypervigilance is essential. It&rsquo;s worth it for organizations to train and re-train their teams to spot phishing attempts. Additionally, advanced security solutions, such as <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/companies-zero-trust-lose-data-breach/" >zero trust</a>, will become more prevalent as verification of users, devices, context and permissions will all be needed to keep invaders at bay.</p>

<html><body><p>Understaffed security teams need all the help they can get, and they are finding that help through SOAR.</p>
<p>SOAR &mdash; security orchestration, automation and response &mdash; is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-orchestration-automation-response-soar" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"  target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >defined by Gartner</a> as the &ldquo;technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team.&rdquo; Gartner identifies a SOAR platform&rsquo;s three prime functionalities: Threat and vulnerability management, security operations automation and incident response.</p>
<p>The number of threats coming across the network and endpoints each day overwhelms most organizations. Adding SOAR technology strengthens your overall security posture by <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/leverage-automation-soar-successfully/" >automating the most repetitive and tedious aspects of threat management and incident response</a>.</p>
<h2>The Role of Each Component</h2>
<p>The efficiency of SOAR&rsquo;s security operation comes from each of its components. Collectively, SOAR automates the most mundane and time-consuming tasks in a Security Operations Center (SOC) &mdash; tasks that are absolutely necessary to ensure the highest levels of protection for networks and data, but also tasks that take already overworked security teams from their other duties. Understanding how each piece of the SOAR platform operates will help organizations build the solution that works best for them.</p>
<p>Orchestration connects and simplifies all of the security tools and systems within the infrastructure. It integrates custom-built applications with built-in security tools, so they all work with each other seamlessly. In addition, it connects disparate endpoints, firewalls and behavior analytics. While all this connectivity means more alerts, it also improves the ability to detect potential threats before they become full-blown incidents.</p>
<p>Automation affects security procedures across the SOC. Security automation takes the vast amount of information generated through orchestration and analyzes it through machine learning processes. When performed manually, these tasks were not only time-consuming but also subject to human failures. The number of alerts, both false and positive, overwhelmed security teams and left them little time for other projects. With security automation, SOAR handles manual tasks such as scanning logs and handling ticket requests, vulnerability checks and auditing processes. This allows security teams to address anomalies quickly.</p>
<p>Incident response within SOAR allows security teams to monitor, manage and take action when a potential threat is indicated. The response component also handles post-incident activities such as threat intelligence sharing and case management. Incident response tools collect all the information surrounding the incident and share that information through open-source databases for others to reference to add to their security automation toolkit.</p>

<h2>The Playbook</h2>
<p>Essential to the success of the SOAR automation solution is its playbooks. Like a football coach&rsquo;s playbook, the SOAR playbook outlines the game plan for the security team&rsquo;s incident response. Simply, the playbook is a set of workflows that put incident response into action. Automated systems using AI and ML need predefined sets of procedures to be able to detect anomalies, and the steps to follow whenever an issue occurs. With these defined workflows within the playbook, automation takes over with minimal human involvement.</p>
<p>The playbook not only spells out the entire process of how to handle incidents, but it offers consistency and redundancy. Playbooks are useful in situations such as threat hunting and threat intelligence, as well as vulnerability management. They also offer workload guidance to security team members, providing institutional knowledge about the organization&rsquo;s security processes and incident response.</p>
<p>Included in the playbook will be lists of permissions, tools and network access, potential conflicts with business operations and a defined list of expected results. They aren&rsquo;t static documents and should be updated and revised whenever there are failures in the system. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >guidelines</a> for creating playbooks.</p>
<h2>The Importance of SOAR</h2>
<p>With more endpoints to protect and more data generated, protecting the network has never been more important or more difficult. Security teams face a steady flow of alerts, many of them false positives, and do so with limited staff. The more time the SOC spends addressing alerts, the less time they have to spend on other vital security projects. When this task is handled manually, it sets up the additional risk of human error &mdash;&nbsp;something gets missed, leading to a cyber incident.</p>
<p>The digital transformation, while streamlining so many processes and improving overall productivity, has created a security gap problem. Legacy systems don&rsquo;t easily integrate with new technologies. Security tools become outdated or are siloed. And again, the talent shortage comes into play; these new technologies require specific skills and there just aren&rsquo;t enough people out there with the specific training needed.</p>
<p>SOAR solutions won&rsquo;t fix all your security problems, but the orchestration and automation handle the repetitive and redundant tasks while connecting disparate security systems and data collection. It makes security processes more efficient in real-time. The security team can more accurately identify and respond to incidents without developing alert fatigue.</p>
<h2>The Relationship Between SOAR and SIEM</h2>
<p>Many organizations already deploy security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to detect and manage threats, so they may not see the point of adding another security solution. However, for threat management to be successful, it needs rapid incident response. <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/soar-the-second-arm-of-security-operations/" >SIEM and SOAR don&rsquo;t stand alone</a>; they are more effective at working together.</p>
<p>SIEM is all about detection, but detection alone is not enough. Playbooks for SIEMs are complex and expensive to produce, so the detection layer may not go as deep as it should. SOAR solutions balance this with playbooks and processes that introduce well-defined incident response plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem" >Using SIEM</a> in tandem with SOAR saves time and money. Using the solutions alone means going through one step (detection) and then following it up with the second step (incident response) as separate procedures. Instead, when the SIEM and SOAR solutions run concurrently, the high number of alerts generated through the SIEM are addressed in real-time with the SOAR.</p>
<p>SOAR solutions should be part of an overall security defense system rather than a stand-alone platform. It should complement the other tools in the SOC, just as it should complement, and not replace, humans on the security team. Used in this way, SOAR solutions will augment the SOC with automated and orchestrated incident response.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>In this digital age, it is increasingly important for businesses to be aware of their online presence and data security. Many companies have already implemented measures such as two-factor authentication and strong password policies &ndash; but there is still a great deal of exposure regarding email visibility.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that cyber criminals are always looking for ways to gain access to sensitive information. Unfortunately, emails are a particularly easy target as many businesses do not encrypt or mask their messages. That means anyone with the right skills and tools can intercept and read your emails &mdash; or even alter them.</p>
<p>So this begs the question, should you consider hiding your work emails? Let&rsquo;s discuss the growing risks associated with exposed email addresses and what organizations should consider when deciding on their path forward.</p>
<h2>Exposed Business Email Addresses: A Growing Risk</h2>
<p>With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks, organizations must understand the dangers associated with exposed business email addresses. While traditional threats such as phishing and identity theft remain, businesses must face new threats against data protection.</p>
<p>For instance, recent reports have noted a trend in attackers using leaked emails to access other accounts through reused passwords. This means even if an organization has strong password policies, it can still be vulnerable to hackers gaining access to sensitive information through compromised accounts elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another growing risk is the potential for email addresses to be sold or used in targeted marketing campaigns. While some organizations may not consider this a severe threat, it can still create a meaningful security hole. Using these campaigns, malicious actors can gain access to valuable company data and contacts.</p>
<h2>How Are Businesses Protecting Themselves?</h2>
<p>A few years ago, organizations began recognizing the value of keeping their emails secure from specific applications, websites and vendors. Although this didn&rsquo;t eliminate all risks, it reduced the possibility of a malicious actor gaining access to sensitive information and led to the development of automated email masking solutions.</p>
<p>Now, organizations are starting to implement various strategies to protect their businesses from the potential risks of exposed emails. One such method is hiding email addresses with redirect services. Obscuring email addresses when entering third-party databases ensures malicious actors cannot access a business&rsquo;s confidential information.</p>
<p>Organizations also utilize email authentication protocols to verify that emails from their domains originate from an authorized source. This will help to reduce the chance of spoofed emails entering inboxes, as well as improve deliverability. These measures have succeeded in improving email security and protecting organizations from malicious actors.</p>
<h2>Are Email Redirect Services the Right Answer?</h2>
<p>Email redirect services are a valuable tool for organizations to protect their data from malicious actors. By obscuring emails in databases, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized parties accessing sensitive information. Additionally, email redirect services are relatively easy to implement and cost-effective compared to other cybersecurity measures. While redirects should not be the only answer to secure data protection completely, they can form an essential part of a comprehensive security strategy that includes two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication, educating employees on secure passwords and policy development.</p>
<h2>How to Approach Your Organization&rsquo;s Email Security</h2>
<p>Organizations must carefully consider the risks associated with exposed business emails and take steps to protect themselves. Email redirect services can be a valuable tool; however, it is crucial that organizations also assess their overall security strategy and make sure they are taking all necessary measures to protect their data.</p>
<p>When assessing an organization&rsquo;s email security, it is essential to consider how internal adoption will be achieved. This involves ensuring that all employees, regardless of their technical background, understand the risks involved with exposed business emails and know how to protect their data from malicious actors. While departmentalizing the adoption process to smaller groups that see a larger volume of emails can help make the transition easier, it is essential to ensure that everyone in the organization understands email security. This is achieved through a clear email security policy, communicating it across the organization and training staff on data protection.</p>
<p>While email anonymity plays a significant role in protecting data, it is just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. There are other aspects of cybersecurity that need to be taken into consideration too. Social engineering techniques like those employed in the Lapsus$ attacks on Rockstar Games and Uber require detailed information about an organization&rsquo;s internal processes and job descriptions. Ensuring these details remain confidential is essential for keeping your business safe from cyber threats.</p>
<h2>Protecting Your Business from Email Exposure</h2>
<p>In the end, email security is integral to any organization&rsquo;s data protection strategy. By taking steps to obscure email addresses in databases, enforcing policies that protect sensitive information and educating staff on good password practices, organizations can ensure they are protected against cyber attackers looking to exploit exposed business emails.</p>
<p>To further increase protection, businesses should also use two-factor authentication (2FA) to verify user identities when logging into accounts and invest in secure email gateways which automatically filter out malicious emails before they even reach employees&rsquo; inboxes. Taking these steps can help guard against costly long-term security breaches and protect organizations from modern-day attacks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>The finance and insurance sector proved a top target for cybersecurity threats in 2022. The IBM Security <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence" >X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a> found this sector ranked as the second most attacked, with 18.9% of X-Force incident response cases. If, as Shakespeare tells us, past is prologue, this sector will likely remain a target in 2023. Finance and insurance ranked as the most attacked sector from 2016 to 2020, with the manufacturing sector the most attacked in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<h2>What are the Top Threats?</h2>
<p>The X-Force threat report found that <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/2023-x-force-threat-intelligence-index-report/" >backdoor attacks</a> in the finance and insurance sector were the most commonly observed action on objective, making up 29% of attacks. In fact, backdoor attacks &mdash;&nbsp; the compromise of systems or data by remotely negating or bypassing security measures &mdash; were the most common type of attacker action that X-Force incident responders handled. The next top attack types for this sector, both at 11%, were ransomware (code that blocks access to data or systems until money is paid) and maldocs (files, like word processing documents, spreadsheets or PDF documents that execute malicious code when interacted with).</p>
<p>Why do cyber criminals use these types of attacks against the finance and insurance industry? Because they work. These attacks rely on user carelessness and distraction, allowing an attacker to gain an opening. Backdoor compromises often happen as a result of unpatched vulnerabilities or lacking security measures. Ransomware and maldoc attacks happen when a person clicks on a fake link or opens an attachment they shouldn&rsquo;t. In fact, the report found that in this sector, the top infection vector was spear phishing attachments, used in 53% of attacks. The exploitation of public-facing applications came in second place at 18% of attacks. This is when criminals take advantage of a weakness in an internet-facing computer or program. Clicking on spear phishing links came in third as the initial access vector in 12% of cases.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=RSRWW&amp;utm_id=SI-Blog-CTA-Button-XFTII-2023" >Read the Threat Index</a>
<h2>Geography and Cybersecurity Intertwine</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a geographic factor to threats executed in the finance and insurance sector. Europe saw the highest volume of attacks (33%) against this sector, with Asia-Pacific a close second place at 31%. Why these two regions? First, Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine had an impact. There is a cyber criminal element to modern warfare, and this <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/analytics/ukraine-war-fault-line-cybercrime-forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >war opened a fault line in cyber crime</a>. Threat actor groups resided in both countries, and both have dispersed across Europe in the wake of the conflict. These criminal groups, which in the past often worked together, now frequently fight each other. Many European businesses find themselves in the middle of that conflict.</p>
<p>In Asia-Pacific &mdash; specifically Japan &mdash; there was a spike in Emotet malware in 2022 after a brief hiatus throughout 2021. The X-Force threat report notes that spam campaigns, driven by Emotet, appeared across several sectors, with most cases occurring in manufacturing and finance and insurance.</p>
<h2>The Defensive Posture Required for Cyber Resilience</h2>
<p>The X-Force threat report notes that finance and insurance organizations tend to be further along in both digital transformations and cloud adoption progress relative to other industries. Another sign of maturity is the prevalence of the CISO role in this sector. A <a href="https://www.heidrick.com/en/insights/compensation-trends/2022-global-chief-information-security-officer-ciso-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >2022 Global CISO Survey</a> found that more than two-thirds of CISOs were at companies with annual revenue of $5 billion or more, and they worked most often in financial services and technology and telecom. The maturity within this sector often means that attackers have to work harder to successfully execute attacks against these organizations. That&rsquo;s a possible clue as to why criminals have set their sights on other sectors in recent years.</p>
<p>How exactly do digital transformation and cloud adoption build a defensive posture? It comes down to resilience and speed. Organizations at the mature stage of digital transformation are nimbler and better able to cope with disruption at a faster clip, whether from supply chain woes or ransomware demands. Speed and flexibility are necessary when dealing with cyber criminals, as they have managed to execute their attacks faster than ever. The report notes that ransomware attacks once took criminals two months to execute in 2019. By 2021, that timeline shrank to four days. As attacks come faster, organizations need a proactive approach to cybersecurity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/view-from-davos-the-changing-economics-of-cybercrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Cyber resilience</a> is part of that approach. Cyber hygiene &mdash; the steps and policies organizations put in place to maintain the health of their systems and the security of their users &mdash; is part of that. Removing the silos between security and business has also been necessary to gain resilience. Staying vigilant to threats, particularly those aimed at your sector, is critical for creating a flexible defensive posture that can repel threats and, when necessary, withstand them.</p>
<h2>How Regulations and Standards Affect the Finance and Insurance Sector</h2>
<p>Staying aware of evolving and emerging threats, as well as how to defend against them, is a necessary consideration, no matter your business sector. Becoming a public victim of a breach does reputational and financial damage. However, in the finance and insurance sector, perhaps more than any other, mandated regulations and industry-accepted standards play an outsized role. These standards place an additional burden. Nearly all cybersecurity regulations impact finance and insurance firms specifically, and have now, for decades, serving as a harbinger for other sectors. Let&rsquo;s review just a sampling of the standards and regulations that affect this sector:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PCI DSS: </strong>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard governs how organizations of all sizes and sectors manage credit card transactions. It aims to protect debit and credit card transactions from breaches. Begun in 1999, it&rsquo;s not a new standard, but it is one that is regularly updated.</li>
<li><strong>SOX: </strong>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2002 that governs financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>GLBA: </strong>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. This act requires that financial institutions explain both how they share and protect their customers&rsquo; private information.</li>
<li><strong>PSD2:</strong> The Payment Services Directive was an EU law from 2009 that outlined EU rules for electronic payments like direct debit, credit cards, mobile and online transactions, and credit transfers. Its objective was to make payments between EU countries secure. In 2018, the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) added more consumer protection and security. It also regulates newer modes of online and mobile payments.</li>
<li><strong>New SEC rules: </strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed cybersecurity rules in 2022 that affect <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/sec-proposes-new-cybersecurity-rules-financial-services/" >how financial services firms handle cybersecurity</a>. They hope to finalize the rules sometime in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vigilance in 2023</h2>
<p>As the IBM Security <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence" >X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a> makes plain, cyber threats are not diminishing. In fact, they are getting more prevalent, creative and swift. As a CISO within the finance and insurance sector, the report&rsquo;s writers offer three actions you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="resolved"><strong>Track your assets.</strong> Know what you are protecting, its potential appeal to cyber criminals and when assets are added or subtracted. </span></li>
<li><span class="resolved"><strong>Know your adversaries. </strong>Who is coming after you and why? How sophisticated are they and how will they try to exploit you?</span></li>
<li><span class="resolved"><strong>Manage visibility. </strong>Confirm that you can see into your data sources and know what would indicate the presence of an attacker. Then outline how you would proceed to stop the attack and minimize disruption.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51962" >Download the report</a> for more insights and recommendations and a comprehensive view of the current threat landscape.</p>

<html><body><p><i>This blog was made possible through contributions from Fred Chidsey and Joseph Lozowski.</i></p>
<p>The 2023 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index shows that vulnerability discovery has rapidly increased year-over-year and according to X-Force&rsquo;s cumulative vulnerability and exploit database, only 3% of vulnerabilities are associated with a zero day. X-Force often observes zero-day exploitation on Internet-facing systems as a vector for initial access however, X-Force has also observed zero-day attacks leveraged by attackers to accomplish their goals and objectives after initial access was obtained.</p>
<p>In this post, X-Force will detail an investigation associated with a zero-day attack that occurred less than 24 hours after the release of the zero day &mdash; one of the fastest adoption times for financially motivated cybercriminals identified by X-Force since 2020. This incident is connected to a recent mass <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/clop-goanywhere-attacks-have-now-hit-130-organizations-a-21526" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >ransomware attack</a>, which takes advantage of a vulnerability in Forta&rsquo;s file-transfer tool, GoAnyWhere.</p>
<p>This blog will also explore the relationship between ransomware attack paths and the adoption of zero days by cybercriminals: by analyzing the most commonly used zero-day exploits by cybercriminals observed by X-Force over the last three years, we&rsquo;ve found that the ransomware attack lifecycle is a key driver behind zero-day adoption for cyber criminals.</p>
<h2><b>GoAnyWhere But Laterally</b></h2>
<p>In February 2023, X-Force responded to an incident where a client had received alerts from their security tooling regarding potential lateral movement originating from a server within their network. The client&rsquo;s security team discovered an authorized user account operating on a GoAnyWhere MFT server. Through analysis of existing security telemetry and forensic evidence, X-Force identified evidence of post-exploitation activity and exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 on the GoAnyWhere MFT server.</p>
<p>X-Force uncovered exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 through timeline analysis indicating a common post-exploitation command to download a file from a remote IP address was executed on the GoAnyWhere server at the same time a GoAnyWhere license error log was written referencing the same remote IP address. Upon first exploitation, the attacker attempted to download and execute a malicious payload which would have established a command and control (C2) channel via a Cobalt Strike but the security tooling on the GoAnyWhere server detected and removed the malicious payload. X-Force recovered similar evidence indicating that the attacker attempted to execute Mimikatz through the exploitation of the vulnerability and was prevented.</p>
<p>With security tooling blocking the execution of remote post-exploitation commands, the attacker pivoted to interactive access via remote desktop protocol (RDP) by leveraging the vulnerability to create a new user account and then accessing the server via RDP. With interactive access to the server via RDP, the attacker continued with credential harvesting operations by accessing credential data using Task Manager to dump the contents of the LSASS process.</p>
<p>Following the credential harvesting operations, the attacker began internal reconnaissance focusing on Active Directory using CSVDE and scanning for accessible SMB shares. Comma Separated Value Directory Exchange (CSVDE) is Microsoft Windows utility that enables the user to import and export objects into or from Active Directory.</p>
<p>The attacker pivoted C2 channels by uploading a web shell to the GoAnyWhere server and began executing point-exploitation commands focused on reconnaissance and user account creation. When the web shell was detected and contained, the attacker returned to the server through RDP and performed more credential harvesting activities and leveraged SharpHound to perform additional Active Directory data collections. SharpHound is a component of BloodHound which is an Active Directory reconnaissance tool designed to enumerate and analyze Active Directory relationships and attack paths.</p>
<p>With an understanding of the attacker&rsquo;s access and scope of the incident in place, containment actions were taken to remove the attack from the network completely. Further intelligence gathering of the data collected from the incident indicates that the attacker was a financially motivated attacker focused on ransomware attacks to extort payment.</p>

<h2>Detecting CVE-2023-0669</h2>
<p>CVE-2023-0669 is a remote code injection vulnerability impacting Fortra&rsquo;s GoAnyWhere MFT file transfer software. The vulnerability enables a remote attacker with access to the administrative console to inject pre-authentication commands in the License Response Servlet. Exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 occurs when a remote attacker sends a specially crafted request to the URI &ldquo;/goanywhere/lic/accept&rdquo; to take advantage of an insecure deserialization flaw in the License Response Servlet class. Due to the use of hard-coded keys within the source code of the GoAnyWhere functions, a remote attacker can encrypt and encode arbitrary commands for execution on the target system within the Bundle parameter which is processed by the License Server Servlet without authentication. It is important to note that this exploit requires that the administrative interface for the GoAnyWhere server is accessible to the attacker. At the time of writing this post, X-Force detected over 700 GoAnyWhere servers available on the Internet with nearly 100 GoAnyWhere servers with the default license management ports exposed.</p>

<h2>Threat Driven Approach to Zero Days</h2>
<p>During this incident, the time between the security advisory and the exploitation of CVE-2023-0669 was less than 1 day making it one of the fastest adoption time frames by finically motivated attackers observed by X-Force since 2020. The X-Force Vulnerability and Exploit Database, which has been curating vulnerability and exploit data since 1993 shows that the number of zero days released is increasing year over year, but X-Force observes just a handful of zero days rapidly adopted by cyber criminals each year. It begs to question, &ldquo;why are some zero days rapidly and widely adopted for criminal operations and others not?&rdquo;. Based on the data from the X-Force database and incident response engagements, it appears that that not every zero day is created equal. While every zero day is important and organizations should still devote efforts to patching zero days once a patch is released, there are characteristics of certain zero days that make them more likely to be rapidly and widely adopted by cyber criminals.</p>
<p>The following CVEs were the most rapidly and widely adopted zero days by cyber criminals observed by X-Force since 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-1472 (ZeroLogon)</li>
<li>CVE-2021-26855 (ProxyLogon)</li>
<li>CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207 (ProxyShell)</li>
<li>CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare)</li>
<li>CVE-2022-26925 (PetitPotam)</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0669 (GoAnyWhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2021 X-Force released a blog detailing &ldquo;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/how-ransomware-attacks-happen/" >How Ransomware Attacks Happen</a>&rdquo; and it turns out that the attack path detailed in that post has a direct relationship with zero day adoption by cyber criminals. Analyzing the most widely used zero days, what an attacker can achieve through exploitation, and the incidents in which they were used, indicates that the zero days that enable ransomware operators to quickly and easily obtain their goals and objectives are more likely to be used &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;.</p>
<p>ZeroLogon &mdash; Allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to a domain controller to exploit a NetLogon session and gain domain administrator privilege.</p>
<p>PrintNightmare &mdash; Is a vulnerability affecting the Windows Print Spooler service that enables an attacker to escalate privileges either locally or remotely by loading a malicious DLL which will be executed as SYSTEM.</p>
<p>PetitPotam &mdash; Is a NTLM relay attack that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to take control of an Active Directory domain by triggering a domain controller to relay its credentials to a system controlled by the attacker. With the domain controller NTLM credentials, the attacker can relay them to Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to obtain a DC certificate.&nbsp; The attacker can use the DC certificate request a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) and take control of the entire domain through Pass-The-Ticket attacks.</p>
<p>Because ZeroLogon, PrintNightmare, and PetitPotam allow an attacker to obtain privileged access to Active Directory without credential harvesting or lateral movement, it significantly simplifies the ransomware attack path and as such X-Force observed their use on multiple ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>ProxyShell and ProxyLogon are vulnerabilities that affect on-premises Microsoft Exchange that enable a remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable servers. Microsoft Exchange is an attractive target for attackers because they host business email which can enable internal phishing as well as but also given the tight integration between Exchange and Active Directory, it can also be exploited to move laterally to other high-value systems or access privileged account credentials. According to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/06/24/defending-exchange-servers-under-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" >Microsoft</a>, &ldquo;If compromised, Exchange servers provide a unique environment that could allow attackers to perform various tasks using the same built-in tools or scripts that admins use for maintenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X-Force has observed ProxyShell and ProxyLogon leveraged in multiple ransomware attacks where the attacker was able to obtain domain administrator privileges, exfiltrate sensitive business data, and deploy ransomware directly from the Exchange servers.</p>
<p>Regarding GoAnyWhere, X-Force&rsquo;s observations are that the servers that are exploited tend to be domain-joined Microsoft Windows system that enable the attacker to immediately obtain an opportunity to gain access to high-value systems within Active Directory.</p>
<p>A notable absentee from the widely adopted zero-day list was Log4J. While Log4J gained widespread media attention, X-Force did not respond to many serious finically motivated incidents where Log4J was exploited. It is possible that organizations did a heroic job of patching vulnerable systems, however, given the number of systems still vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 it appears that cyber criminals have not adopted it as widely for another reason. One interesting data point that may explain why Log4J has not been observed in as many incident response engagements is that based on X-Force vulnerability data, the majority of vulnerable Log4J systems are running Linux. Pivoting from Linux to Microsoft Active Directory requires more knowledge, capabilities and falls outside of the normal ransomware attack lifecycle further indicating that the ransomware attack lifecycle is driving zero-day adoption for cyber criminals.</p>
<h2>A Path Forward: Understanding the Attackers</h2>
<p>The path forward for zero-day preparation and management requires organizations adopt a threat driven approach. It&rsquo;s critical that organizations understand which attackers are most likely going to target them, what the attackers&rsquo; goals and objectives are, and how the attackers going about accomplishing them. With this knowledge, organizations will be better prepared to identify which vulnerabilities and zero days are most likely going to be adopted. But prevention alone is no longer enough. It&rsquo;s equally important today to focus on detection engineering &ndash; finding new ways to lengthen attack lifecycles and making it harder for threat actors to execute their objectives. By improving detection and response capabilities, businesses can make it more difficult for attackers to complete their goals even if they are able to gain access through vulnerability exploitation.</p>

<html><body><p>Backdoor access was the most common threat vector in 2022. According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=RSRWW&amp;utm_id=SI-Blog-Inline-XFTII-2023&amp;_ga=2.149406390.1468948635.1678723766-755013818.1675960550" >the 2023 IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index</a>, 21% of incidents saw the use of backdoors, outpacing perennial compromise favorite ransomware, which came in at just 17%.</p>
<p>The good news? In <span class="resolved">67%</span> of backdoor attacks, defenders were able to disrupt attacker efforts and lock digital doorways before ransomware payloads were deployed. The not-so-great news? With backdoor access now available at a bargain price on the dark web, businesses must be prepared to block more break-ins and implement strategies that keep attackers from coming back.</p>
<h2>What is a Backdoor, and How Does it Get Unlocked?</h2>
<p>A backdoor is an additional access route to a system or piece of software. Unlike more familiar front door routes, backdoors aren&rsquo;t subject to typical security checks and screenings. Instead, these doors provide direct access for users who know where they are.</p>
<p>In practice, there are two common ways for backdoors to become unlocked. The first is by design. Software developers may intentionally add a backdoor for ease of access when it comes to feature testing and functional evaluation. These backdoors are legitimate parts of a software release, which means they won&rsquo;t show up as a security concern. If backdoor code is left in place when software is shipped and installed, doors persist across all installed versions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible for attackers to leverage code vulnerabilities that haven&rsquo;t been detected or patched to create their own persistent backdoors. In this case, these doors are virtually undetectable until attackers begin to move in earnest.</p>
<h2>Where to Look for Backdoor Building</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no single part of system infrastructure that lends itself to ideal backdoor building. There are, however, several common points of compromise that security teams should search for evidence of backdoor operations.</p>
<p>First up are operating systems. If attackers can gain (or create) access to key OS functions, they can disrupt every aspect of business operations. Communication systems are next. These could include video and audio conferencing tools, collaboration software that has access to a host of critical data, or even routers that connect office desktops to the interest. Routers are especially worrisome, given their tendency to use default login and password details for access.</p>
<p>Enterprises must also recognize the role of remote work in backdoor break-ins. Consider an employee that works from home part-time and connects to company servers using a VPN. Even if the staff member is diligent in using a secure and encrypted connection, the technologies in their home &mdash; such as internet routers and mobile devices &mdash;&nbsp;offer a potential pathway for attackers to build backdoors and then move laterally to more critical systems.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=RSRWW&amp;utm_id=SI-Blog-CTA-Button-XFTII-2023" >Read the Threat Index</a>
<h2>Keys to the Kingdom? Discovering Doors on the Dark Web</h2>
<p>For many attackers, discovering backdoors or building their own is both time-consuming and expensive.</p>
<p>To streamline the process of security compromise, these malicious actors are turning to the dark web. Offered anonymity by The Onion Router (TOR), skilled attackers and those looking to buy their way into backdoors find common ground. Attackers with backdoor access simply wait until demand spikes, then post their solutions for sale on dark web marketplaces. Not only do these attacks typically come with detailed instructions, but threat actors may also offer technical support for issues that arise.</p>
<p>Solutions such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/threat-intelligence" >IBM&rsquo;s X-Force dark web analysis</a> provide a way for businesses to discover if backdoor builds are available for sale online. By regularly scanning the dark web for this data, companies can proactively identify potential security issues before attackers take action.</p>
<h2>Closing Time: Tools of the Trade</h2>
<p>While regular searches of the dark web can help companies discover potential backdoor risks, this approach isn&rsquo;t enough on its own. The reason is simple: Not all backdoors make their way onto illicit marketplaces.</p>
<p>In some cases, attackers looking for openings stumble across weaknesses or vulnerabilities that allow them to create backdoors, and rather than keeping them to sell, they simply exploit them in the moment. In others, malicious actors may simply hold on to backdoor data until they see an opportunity.</p>
<p>To address this variation in attack approaches, enterprises must take a multi-prong approach to backdoor defense. In practice, this means implementing solutions such as:</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Threat Assessment</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/threat-management" >X-Force strategic threat assessment</a> can help companies get ahead of attack efforts. Equipped with a better understanding of current threat landscapes along with likely threat vectors, organizations can focus their efforts on bolstering specific defenses that limit the risk of backdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong></p>
<p>Another key component in blocking backdoor break-ins is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/penetration-testing" >penetration testing</a>. By partnering with experienced penetration testing teams, companies can discover where and how their networks are at risk &mdash; before attackers do it for them.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Access</strong></p>
<p>Never trust; always verify. This is the central tenant of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust" >zero trust approach</a>. From user behavior analysis to multifactor authentication to secure single sign-on (SSO) and mobile device management (MDM), taking a zero trust approach limits the ability of attackers to compromise systems, even with the assistance of backdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Managed Detection and Response (MDR)</strong></p>
<p>Companies also need to consider what happens if attackers do get through the door. While the aim is to close and lock as many entrances as possible, no security approach is perfect. This means that eventually, cyber criminals will crack the code and crack open the door. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/managed-detection-response" >Advanced MDR</a> tools allow companies to improve incident response and reduce the time between attack detection and remediation.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a connected protective framework that is more than the sum of its parts. For example, while penetration testing can help identify potential backdoors and zero trust access can limit the number of potential users with access, solutions such as MDR shorten the time required for organizations to respond if incidents occur, in turn reducing total risk.</p>
<h2>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back(door)?</h2>
<p>Backdoor attacks are both popular and problematic, given their ability to fly under the security radar. But it&rsquo;s not all bad news. By understanding how and why backdoors open organizations to risk and implementing tools capable of closing the gap, businesses can better block backdoor break-ins.</p>
