      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/300x200_Blog_032523-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="none">Social media platforms often get a hard time by us parents. But a recent announcement by TikTok of industry first screen time limits might just be enough to win you over. On March 1, the social media platform announced that it will automatically impose a 60-minute daily screen time limit to every account belonging to a user that is under the age of 18. How good?? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I hear what you’re thinking – maybe we can cross TikTok off our list of social media platforms that we need to get our head around? But no, my friends – not so fast! Tik Tok’s new screen time limits are all about parental involvement – which is why I am a fan! So, buckle-up because if you have an under 18 on TikTok (and you’re committed to their digital well-being) then my prediction is that you’ll soon know more about this social media platform than you even thought was possible! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How Do The New Screen Time Limits Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Over the coming weeks, every account that belongs to an under 18-year-old will automatically be set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit. Once they’ve clocked up an hour of scrolling, teens will be asked to enter a passcode, which TikTok will supply, to keep using the platform. TikTok refers to this as an ‘active decision’. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, clearly this isn’t quite the silver bullet to all your screen time worries as teens can choose to opt out of the 60-minute limits. But if they do choose to opt out and then spend more than 100 minutes a day on the platform, they will be prompted to set a daily screen time limit. ‘Will that actually do anything?’ &#8211; I hear you say. Well, in the first month of testing this approach, TikTok found that this strategy resulted in a 234% increase in the use of its screen time management tools – a move in the right direction!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">But Wait, There’s More…</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But here’s the part I love the most: TikTok offers Family Pairing which allows you to link your child’s account to yours. And as soon as you enable Family Pairing, your teen is no longer in control of their own screen time. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Now, don’t get me wrong – I am not a fan of the authoritarian approach when it comes to all things tech. I do prefer a consultative ‘let’s work together’ vibe. However, TikTok’s move to involve parents in making decisions about their child’s screen time means that families will need to talk digital wellbeing more than ever before and here’s why&#8230;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Within the Family Pairings settings, parents are able to set screen time limits based on the day of the week which means homework and holidays can be worked around. There is also a dashboard that shows your child’s screen time usage, the number of times the app was opened plus a breakdown of time spent during the day and night. Now, with all this control and information, you’ll be in quite the powerful position so be prepared to be sold hard by your teen on many the benefits of TikTok! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Maybe It’s Time for A Family Digital Contract?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For years I have been a fan of creating a Family Digital Contract which means you get to outline your family’s expectations around technology use. Now the agreement can include time spent online, the sites that can be visited and even the behaviour you expect of your child when they are online. So, if your kids are avid TikTok users then I highly recommend you do this ASAP. Check out the </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fosi.org.mcas.ms%2Fgood-digital-parenting-tool%2Ffamily-online-safety-agreement-ages-13-and-under%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Family Safety Agreement</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> from the Family Online Safety Institute as a starting point but I always recommend tailoring it to suit the needs of your own tribe.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But let’s keep it real – your kids are not always going to comply, remember how you pushed the boundaries when you were young?? And that’s OK if they understand why their actions weren’t ideal and you have a suitable level of confidence that they will get back on track. However, if you have concerns that they need an additional level of structure to ensure their digital wellbeing remains intact then that’s when TikTok’s Family Pairing can work a treat!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It&#8217;s no secret that social media can be incredibly captivating, possibly even addicting, for so many. And it’s not just TikTok – Instagram, Facebook even Twitter has all been designed to give us regular hits of dopamine with each scroll, like and post. And while I know that parental controls are only one part of the solution, they can be very handy if you need to bring your tween’s usage under control.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Remember, Conversations Are King!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But when all is said and done, please remember that the strength of your relationship with your child is the best way of keeping them safe online and their wellbeing intact. If your kids know that they can come to you about any issue at all – and that you will always have their back – then you’re winning!! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, be interested in their life – both online and offline – ask questions – who do they hang with? How do they spend their time? And remember to share your online experience with them too – get yourself a little ‘tech’ cred – because I promise they will be more likely to come to you when there is a problem.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">‘Till next time – keep talking!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The sound of an incoming email, text, or direct message has a way of getting your attention, so you take a look and see what’s up. It happens umpteen times a week, to the extent that it feels like the flow of your day. And scammers want to tap into that with sneaky phishing attacks that catch you off guard, all with the aim of stealing your personal information or bilking you out of your money. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Phishing attacks take several forms, where scammers masquerade as a legitimate company, financial institution, government agency, or even as someone you know. And they’ll come after you with messages that follow suit:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">“You have a package coming to you, but we’re having a problem with delivering it. Please click here to provide delivery information receive your package.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">“We spotted what may be unusual activity on your credit card. Follow this link to confirm your account information.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">“You owe back taxes.

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can see why phishing attacks can be so effective. Messages like these have an urgency to them, and they seem like they’re legit, or they at least seem like they might deal with something you might care about. But of course they’re just a ruse. And some of them can look and sound rather convincing. Or at least convincing enough that you’ll not only give them a look, but that you’ll also give them a click too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s where the troubles start. Clicking the links or attachments sent in a phishing attack can lead to several potentially nasty things, such as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, plenty of phishing attacks are preventable. A mix of knowing what to look for and putting a few security steps in place can help you keep scammers at bay.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What do phishing attacks look like?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How you end up with one has a lot to do with it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s a good chance you’ve already seen your share of phishing attempts on your phone. A text comes through with a brief message that one of your accounts needs attention, from an entirely unknown number. Along with it is a link that you can tap to follow up, which will send you to a malicious site. In some cases, the sender may skip the link and attempt to start a conversation with the aim of getting you to share your personal information or possibly fork over some payment with a gift card, money order, rechargeable debit card, or other form of payment that is difficult to trace and recover.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of social media, you can expect that the attack will come from an imposter account that’s doing its best to pose as one of those legitimate businesses or organizations we talked about, or perhaps as a stranger or even someone you know. And the name and profile pic will do its best to play the part. If you click on the account that sent it, you may see that it was created only recently and that it has few to no followers, both of which are red flags. The attack is typically conversational, much like described above where the scammer attempts to pump you for personal info or money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Attacks that come by direct messaging apps will work much in the same way. The scammer will set up a phony account, and where the app allows, a phony name and a phony profile pic to go along with it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Email gets a little more complicated because emails can range anywhere from a few simple lines of text to a fully designed piece complete with images, formatting, and embedded links—much like a miniature web page. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the past, email phishing attacks looked rather unsophisticated, rife with poor spelling and grammar, along with sloppy-looking layouts and images. That’s still sometimes the case today. Yet not always. Some phishing emails look like the real thing. Or nearly so.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Examples of phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Case in point, here’s a look at a phishing email masquerading as a McAfee email:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-166860" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY.png" alt="" width="228" height="373" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY.png 228w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY-183x300.png 183w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FAKEY-79x129.png 79w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s a lot going on here. The scammers try to mimic the McAfee brand, yet don’t quite pull it off. Still, they do several things to try and be convincing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Note the use of photography and the box shot of our software, paired with a prominent “act now” headline. It’s not the style of photography we use. Not that people would generally know this. However, some might have a passing thought like, “Huh. That doesn’t really look right for some reason.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond that, there are a few capitalization errors, some misplaced punctuation, plus the “order now” and “60% off” icons look rather slapped on. Also note the little dash of fear it throws in at the top of the email with mention of “There are (42) viruses on your computer.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken all together, you can spot many email scams by taking a closer look, seeing what doesn’t feel right, and then trusting you gut. But that asks you to slow down, take a moment, and eyeball the email critically. Which people don’t always do. And that’s what scammers count on.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Similar ploys see scammers pose as legitimate companies and retailers, where they either ask you to log into a bogus account page to check statement or the status of an order. Some scammers offer links to “discount codes” that are instead links to landing pages designed steal your account login information as well. Similarly, they may simply send a malicious email attachment with the hope that you’ll click it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In other forms of email phishing attacks, scammers may pose as a co-worker, business associate, vendor, or partner to get the victim to click a malicious link or download malicious software. These may include a link to a bogus invoice, spreadsheet, notetaking file, or word processing doc—just about anything that looks like it could be a piece of business correspondence. Instead, the link leads to a scam website that asks the victim “log in and download” the document, which steals account info as a result. Scammers may also include attachments to phishing emails that can install malware directly on the device, sometimes by infecting an otherwise everyday document with a malicious payload.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Email scammers may also pose as someone you know, whether by propping up an imposter email account or by outright hijacking an existing account. The attack follows the same playbook, using a link or an attachment to steal personal info, request funds, or install malware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While you can’t outright stop phishing attacks from making their way to your computer or phone, you can do several things to keep yourself from falling to them. Further, you can do other things that may make it more difficult for scammers to reach you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Pause and think about the message for a minute.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The content and the tone of the message can tell you quite a lot. Threatening messages or ones that play on fear are often phishing attacks, such angry messages from a so-called tax agent looking to collect back taxes. Other messages will lean heavy on urgency, like the phony McAfee phishing email above that says your license has expired today and that you have “(42)” viruses. And during the holidays, watch out for loud, overexcited messages about deep discounts on hard-to-find items. Instead of linking you off to a proper ecommerce site, they may link you to a scam shopping site that does nothing but steal your money and the account information you used to pay them. In all, phishing attacks indeed smell fishy. Slow down and review that message with a critical eye. It may tip you off to a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Deal directly with the company or organization in question.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some phishing attacks can look rather convincing. So much so that you’ll want to follow up on them, like if your bank reports irregular activity on your account or a bill appears to be past due. In these cases, don’t click on the link in the message. Go straight to the website of the business or organization in question and access your account from there. Likewise, if you have questions, you can always reach out to their customer service number or web page.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Consider the source.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When scammers contact you via social media, that in of itself can be a tell-tale sign of a scam. Consider, would an income tax collector contact you over social media? The answer there is no. For example, </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fnewsroom%2Fhow-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">in the U.S. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes it quite clear that they will never contact taxpayers via social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. (Let alone send angry, threatening messages.) In all, legitimate businesses and organizations don’t use social media as a channel for official communications. They have accepted ways they will, and will not, contact you. If you have any doubts about a communication you received, contact the business or organization in question directly and follow up with one of their customer service representatives. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Don’t download attachments. And most certainly don’t open them.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some phishing attacks involve attachments packed with malware like the ransomware, viruses, and keyloggers we mentioned earlier. If you receive a message with such an attachment, delete it. Even if you receive an email with an attachment from someone you know, follow up with that person. Particularly if you weren’t expecting an attachment from them. Scammers will often hijack or spoof email accounts of everyday people to spread malware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Hover over links to verify the URL.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On computers and laptops, you can hover your cursor over links without clicking on them to see the web address. Take a close look at the addresses the message is using. If it’s an email, look at the email address. Maybe the address doesn’t match the company or organization at all. Or maybe it looks like it almost does, yet it adds a few letters or words to the name. This marks yet another sign that you may have a phishing attack on your hands. Scammers also use the common tactic of a link shortener, which creates links that almost look like strings of indecipherable text. These shortened links mask the true address, which may indeed be a link to scam site. Delete the message. If possible, report it. Many social media platforms and messaging apps have built-in controls for reporting suspicious accounts and messages.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Go with who you know.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On social media and messaging platforms, stick to following, friending, and messaging people who you really know. As for those people who contact you out of the blue, be suspicious. Sad to say, they’re often scammers canvassing these platforms for victims. Better yet, where you can, set your profile to private, which makes it more difficult for scammers select and stalk you for an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Remove your personal information from sketchy data broker sites.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How’d that scammer get your phone number or email address anyway? Chances are, they pulled that information off a data broker site. Data brokers buy, collect, and sell detailed personal information, which they compile from several public and private sources, such as local, state, and federal records, plus third parties like supermarket shopper’s cards and mobile apps that share and sell user data. Moreover, they’ll sell it to anyone who pays for it, including people who’ll use that information for scams. You can help reduce those scam texts and calls by removing your information from those sites. </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com.mcas.ms%2Flearn%2Fpersonal-data-cleanup%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Our Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">8. Use online protection software.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>

Further, it can steer you away from dangerous websites and block malware and phishing sites if you accidentally click on a malicious link. And overall, strong virus and malware protection can further block any attacks on your devices. Be sure to protect your smartphones in addition to your computers and laptops as well, particularly given all the sensitive things we do on them, like banking, shopping, and booking rides and travel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once phishing attacks were largely the domain of bogus emails, yet now they’ve spread to texts, social media, and messaging apps—anywhere a scammer can send a fraudulent message while posing as a reputable source.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers count on you taking the bait, the immediate feelings of fear or concern that there’s a problem with your taxes or one of your accounts. They also prey on scarcity, like during the holidays where people search for great deals on gifts and have plenty of packages on the move. With a critical eye, you can often spot those scams. Sometimes, a pause and a little thought is all it takes. And in the cases where a particularly cagey attack makes its way through, online protection software can warn you that the link you’re about to click is indeed a trap. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

But those days have long gone. Unless you have been living off the grid and opted out of life completely, having an online presence is now essential. Whether you’re paying bills, booking appointments or renewing your insurance premiums, many companies have made it almost impossible to conduct your business in person, forcing even the most reluctant of us online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, many of us consider ourselves to be proactive in managing just what we share online by using VPNs, not always setting up accounts with online stores and ensuring our social media privacy settings are nice and tight. But unfortunately, managing your privacy online is more complicated than that. In fact, most of us maybe sharing our private information online every day without even knowing. So, in the spirit of keeping you safe – here are three different areas that I suggest you focus on to ensure you know exactly where you are sharing your private information</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Your Everyday Browsing</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Every time you visit an online site, send an email, search for information or basically do anything online, multiple parties collect this information. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP), Wi-Fi network administrator, operating system e.g. Windows or iOS, search engine plus the websites and apps you use will all keep a record of what’s you’re up to – even if you are in Incognito Mode!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This information is often gathered using cookies – small files that are placed on your device by the website that you visit. These are created whenever you visit a website, and they contain data about your visit. Some websites are required by law to advise you if and when they use cookies but if you choose to reject cookies, your browsing experience can become really clunky.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What each of these parties does with your private information varies. Your ISP, for example, can easily put together a pretty accurate profile based on your searching, location and downloads and link this to your IP (unique) address. This data can be held for years – subject to your country’s laws and could potentially be used for surveillance, policing and even advertising. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">You know those annoying pop-up adds that just randomly appear on your devices? Well – that’s adware, software that is designed to generate revenue through advertisements.

Alternatively, hackers can insert it into your system by exploiting a vulnerability in your software – that’s why you need to keep all your software updated!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Cybercrims have mastered the art of capturing our credentials by tricking browsers to share our personal details and here’s how: unsuspecting people are lured to a compromised website that has an invisible form. Autofill identifies that there is a form on the site and then gives up your private information allowing the hacker to collect your credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">A couple things make Android phones attractive to cyber criminals and scammers.

<p><span data-contrast="none">So, just like computers and laptops, Android phones are susceptible to attack. And when you consider how much of our lives we keep on our phones, the importance of protecting them can’t be overstated. Steps truly are called for.

<p><span data-contrast="none">When it comes to viruses and malware on Android phones, malicious apps are often to blame. They’ll disguise themselves in many ways, such as utility apps, wallpaper apps, games, photo editors, and so on.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Google Play does its part to keep its virtual shelves free of malware-laden apps with a thorough submission process as </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.googleblog.com.mcas.ms%2F2021%2F04%2Fhow-we-fought-bad-apps-and-developers.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">reported by Google</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and through its App Defense Alliance that shares intelligence across a network of partners, of which we’re a proud member.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet, bad actors find ways to sneak malware into the store. Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they’ll embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt </span><span data-contrast="none">malicious </span><span data-contrast="none">code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for reviewers to sniff out. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Beyond Google Play, Android allows users to download apps from third-party app stores, which may or may not have a thorough app submission process in place. Moreover, some third-party app stores are actually fronts for organized cybercrime gangs, built specifically to distribute malware. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How do I know if my Android phone has a virus or is infected? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You might spot the signs rather quickly. Sometimes, you might not. Some malware can make your phone run poorly, which may indicate a technical issue, yet it can also be a symptom of a hacked phone. Others work quietly in the background without you knowing it. Either way, both cases provide good reasons to run regular scans on your phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s look at some possible signs:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Sluggish performance, battery drain, and a hot phone </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malware has a way of taking up resources and eating up battery life as it furiously does its work in the background. For example, adware or clicker malware can hijack your phone and tap the central processing unit to run the complex calculations needed to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, thus putting high stress on your device. In a way, it’s like having a second person using your phone at the same time as you are. This can make your phone hot to the touch, like it’s been sitting in the sun, because the stress malware puts on your phone could cause it to overheat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Popup ads suddenly appear on your phone. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Adware is annoying as it sounds, and potentially even more malicious in nature. If popup ads suddenly pepper your phone, it may be malware that distributes ads without your consent, which can generate revenue for rogue developers (they can get paid per view and per click). Worse yet, adware can also collect personal information and browsing history from your phone, which bad actors can then sell—a major invasion of your privacy.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A potential telltale sign that your phone has been compromised is the appearance of new apps that you didn’t download, along with spikes in data usage that you can’t account for. Likewise, if you see calls in your phone&#8217;s history that you didn’t make, that’s a warning as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like an overdraft statement or seeing a suspicious charge your bank statement, this is a possible sign of malware installed on your device and is using it to perform subscriptions scam or premium SMS messages to unsolicited services.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to avoid malware and viruses on your Android phone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Broadly, you can take two big steps toward keeping you and your phone safer from attack. The first is to keep a critical eye open as you use your phone. Malware authors rely on us to trust what we see a little too quickly, such as when it comes time to download that new app or tap on a link in a phishing email that looks legitimate, yet most certainly isn’t upon closer inspection. Slow down and scrutinize what you see. If something seems fishy, don’t tap or interact with it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The second big step is to </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com.mcas.ms%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.wsandroid.suite%26shortlink%3Dmmsandroid%26pid%3DWeb%26c%3DHome%2520page%2520mobile%2520blade%2520-%2520Android%2520CTA%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">use online protection software on your Android phone</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

If an app asks for way more than you bargained for, like a simple game wanting access to your camera or microphone, it may be a scam. Delete the app. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers have put Android phones in their crosshairs. And for some time now. While phishing emails and smishing texts with sketchy links persists as avenues of attack, a popular form of attack comes by way of malicious app downloads. One reason why is that malicious apps disguise themselves so well, as a utility or game you really want on your phone. You’re more apt to tap “Install” when you’re actively shopping for an app than to tap on a link in an unsolicited email or text.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet as with so many of today’s online attacks, a combination of good sense and strong online protection software can prevent viruses and malware from ending up on your phone. Slowing down and putting preventative measures in place goes a long way toward keeping what’s arguably your most important device far more secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/300x200_Blog_Spring_Cleaning.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/300x200_Blog_Spring_Cleaning.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/300x200_Blog_Spring_Cleaning-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Throw open the windows and let in some fresh air. It’s time for spring cleaning.</p>
<p>And that goes for your digital stuff too.</p>
<p>Whether it’s indeed spring where you are or not, you can give your devices, apps, and online accounts a good decluttering. Now’s the time. Cleaning them up can <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs">protect your privacy and your identity</a> because when there’s less lying about, there’s less for hackers to scoop up and exploit.</p>
<p>The reality is that we accumulate plenty of digital clutter that needs cleaning up from time to time. Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bunches of one-off accounts at online stores we won’t frequent again.</li>
<li>Membership in messages board or forums you no longer drop in on.</li>
<li>Plenty of outdated apps and programs that are still sitting on your devices.</li>
<li>Aging files that are no longer relevant, like spreadsheets and records from years ago.</li>
<li>And photos—oh, photos! We have plenty of those, right?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Seven steps for digital spring cleaning</strong></h3>
<p>Together, these things take up space on your devices and, in some cases, can open you up to security hazards. Let’s take a look at how you can clean up in a few steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Review your accounts and delete the ones you don’t use.</strong> Look through your bookmarks, your password manager, or the other places where you store your passwords and usernames. Review the sites and services associated with them critically. If you haven’t used an account in some time, log in one last time, remove all personal info, and deactivate it.</p>
<p>Doing so can keep your email address, usernames, and passwords out of unnecessary circulation. Major breaches <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/shinyhunters-exposes-over-125-million-online-credentials/?hilite=%27shiny%27">like this one</a> happen with unfortunate regularity, and the sad thing is that you may not even be aware that a site you’ve used has been hit. Meanwhile, your name, password, and info associated with that account (such as your credit card) are in the hands of hackers. Limit your exposure. Close those old accounts.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get organized, and safer too, with a password manager.</strong> While <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27">creating strong, unique passwords for each of our accounts</a> is a must nowadays, it can be quite the feat, given all of the accounts in our lives. Here’s where <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/why-do-i-need-a-password-manager/?hilite=%27password%27%2C%27manager%27">a password manager</a> comes in. It can create those strong, unique passwords for you. Not only that, but it also stores your passwords on secure servers, away from hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Along those lines, never store your passwords on your computer or device, like a text document or spreadsheet. Should your device ever get compromised, lost, or stolen, having passwords stored on them are like handing over the keys to your digital life.</p>
<p><strong>3. Clean your PC to improve your performance <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs">(and your security)</a>.</strong> Let’s face it, so many of us are so busy with the day-to-day that cleaning up our computers and laptops is way down the list. However, doing so once a month can keep our devices running stronger for longer and even give you that “new computer feeling,” particularly if you haven’t cleaned it up for some time. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/does-pc-cleaning-improve-performance">Check out our guide for improving PC performance</a>. We will walk you through some straightforward steps that can make a marked difference.</p>
<p>Moreover, part of this process should entail bolstering your operating system and apps with the latest updates. Such updates can not only improve speed and functionality, but they also often include security upgrades as well that can make you safer in the long run. If your operating system and apps feature automatic updates, enable them, and they’ll do the work for you.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Organize and store your photos.</strong> Photos. Now there’s a topic all unto itself. Here’s the thing: Estimates show that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/12-trillion-photos-to-be-taken-in-2017-thanks-to-smartphones-chart-2017-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worldwide we took somewhere around 1.2 trillion photos. </a>And you certainly have your share.</p>
<p>However, your photos may be just sitting there, taking up storage space on your computer or phone, instead of becoming something special like an album, greeting cards, a wall hanging, or popping them into a digital picture frame for your kitchen or living room. And this is where a little spring cleaning can be a bit of fun. For tips on cleaning up your photos, backing them up, and making something special with them.</p>
<p><strong>5. Delete old apps and the data associated with them.</strong> Let’s say you have a couple of apps on your phone for tracking your walks, runs, and exercise. You’ve since stopped using one altogether. Go ahead and delete the old one. But before you do, go in and delete your account associated with the app to ensure that any data stored off your phone, along with your password and user id are deleted as well.</p>
<p>For your computers and laptops, follow the same procedure, recognizing that they also may have account data stored elsewhere other than on your device.</p>
<p>In short, many apps today store information that’s stored and maintained by the app provider. Make sure you close your accounts so that data and information is taken out of circulation as well.</p>
<p><strong>6. Shred your old files and encrypt the important files you’re holding on to.</strong> This bit of advice calls for using comprehensive security software on your devices. In addition to protecting you from viruses, malware, and other cyberattacks on your privacy and identity, it can help you protect your sensitive information as well. Such security software can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>File encryption, which renders your most sensitive files into digital gibberish without the encryption key to translate them back.</li>
<li>A digital file shredder that permanently deletes old files from your computer (simply dropping them into the desktop trashcan doesn’t do that—those files can be easily recovered).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs">Identity theft protection</a> monitors the dark web for your personal info that might have been leaked online and immediately alerts you if you might be at risk of fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Throwing away old computers and tech—dispose of them properly.</strong> When it comes time to say goodbye to an old friend, whether that’s a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet, do so in a way that’s friendly to the environment and your security.</p>
<p>Consider this … what’s on that old hard drive of yours? That old computer may contain loads of precious personal and financial info on it. The same goes for your tablets and phones. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers some straightforward advice in their article about <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-data-you-get-rid-your-computer">protecting your data before you get rid of your computer</a>. You don’t want those old tax returns ending up in the trash unprotected.</p>
<p>When it comes time for disposal, you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into the e-waste disposal options in your community. There are services that will dispose of and recycle old technology while doing it in a secure manner.</li>
<li>Some mobile carriers have turn-in programs that will not only dispose of your tech properly, but they’ll give you a financial incentive too—such as money towards a new device.</li>
<li>Lastly, consider the option of reusing the device. There are opportunities to pass it along to a family member or even donate old devices too. Your old tech may be a game-changer for someone else. Again, just be sure to protect that old data!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As with any spring cleaning, you’ll be glad you did it</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the benefits of your work—that’s what spring cleaning is all about, right? With this little list, you can end up with a digital life that’s safer and faster than before.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s high time of year for online risks here in the U.S. with the onset of tax season, where scammers unleash all manner of scams aimed at taxpayers. The complexity, and even uncertainty, of filing a proper tax return can stir up anxieties like, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Have I filed correctly</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Did I claim the right deductions</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Will I get audited</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Will I get stung with a tax penalty</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> are just a few—and these are the very same anxieties that criminals use as the cornerstone of their attacks.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet like so many scams, tax scams give off telltale signs that they’re indeed not on the up-and-up. You have ways you can spot one before you get caught up in one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers prey on the uncertainty of tax season</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, we’ve learned to watch our step with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), so much so that receiving a notification from the IRS can feel like an unwanted surprise. </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Uh oh, did I do something wrong?</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> However, in reality, </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com.mcas.ms%2Fsites%2Fkellyphillipserb%2F2015%2F04%2F12%2F5-things-taxpayers-are-irrationally-afraid-of-and-shouldnt-be%2F%3Fsh%3D5842a0262954%26McasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">less than 2% of returns get audited</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and most discrepancies or adjustments can get handled easily if addressed promptly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Still, that wariness of the IRS makes for ripe pickings when it comes to hackers, who prey on people’s fear of audits and penalties. Common scams include email phishing attacks, phone calls from crooks posing as IRS agents, texts claiming there’s a problem with our tax software, and even robocalls that threaten jail time for unpaid back taxes. What’s more, fraudsters can take things a step further by committing identity theft and then filing tax claims in other people’s names.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, let’s dig into a list of the top scams winding up on our screens and phones during tax time. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Year-over-year, many of the same scams make the list, yet new ones continue to crop up as scammers try to take advantage of current events. A couple recent examples include email phishing scams centered around Employee Retention Credits, pandemic relief checks, and federal stimulus checks. Additionally, the IRS has warned filers about disinformation that circulates on social media, such as bogus advice that urges filers to alter their W-2 figures for a better refund. With new scams entering the mix every tax season, the Dirty Dozen offers plenty of good advice that can help you steer clear of scams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all know the annoyance of spammy phone calls, whether they’re for phony car warranties, tech support services, or debt collection agencies.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to protect yourself from an identity thief from claiming a return in your name is to file yours before they do. As mentioned, many victims of identity theft find out they’ve been scammed when they receive an IRS notification that their tax claim has already been filed. Simply put, file early.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way you can help prevent someone from filing a return in your name is to request a six-digit Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). Once you receive am IP PIN, the IRS will use it to verify your identity when you file by paper or electronically. It’s good for one calendar year, and you can generate a new one each year for your account. You can request an IP PIN at: </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fidentity-theft-fraud-scams%2Fget-an-identity-protection-pin%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also be aware that scammers want your IP PIN as well. Phone calls, emails, or texts asking for it are scams. Outside of including it when filing your return, the IRS will never ask for it. If you are working with a tax professional, only provide it when it comes time to file.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>March is Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day, and at McAfee, we partnered with McAfee Women in Cyber Security (WISE) Community to organize opportunities to learn from each other, find inspiration in shared experiences, and forge new connections.</p>
<p>Speaker events throughout the month opened the door for discussions about inclusion and equity. With awareness, we can make a difference. Check out what we&#8217;ve been up to.</p>
<h2><strong>We joined a panel discussion: A Leader’s Lens on Equity</strong></h2>
<p>Team McAfee joined a discussion with McAfee leaders. The conversation focused on the challenges women often face and issues of equity. Panelists shared their personal experiences and learning, and we explored how we can embrace and advance equity in our workplace. We discussed what it means to be truly inclusive and how we can continuously improve — we all have a part to play.</p>
<p>Here are just a few snippets from the panelists on how we can embrace equity:</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">If you’re looking to protect them online, you have several ways to go about it. Our new McAfee+ Family plans are one way, where two adults and four children get personalized online protection that they can set up and manage on their own. With your McAfee+ Family plan  a simple invitation, you can rest easy that they’re protected against online scams and other threats.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And threats certainly face us all, and hit older adults hardest.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the following table courtesy of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), you can see the risks that adults faced in 2022. While younger victims reported fraud loss at a higher rate, their median losses were typically smaller than the losses of older adults. By the time victims reach their 70s and 80s, the reporting rate dropped, yet the median losses made a significant leap.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Note that these are reported cases of fraud, and those reported to the FTC.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Moreover, as we’ve shared before in articles about elder scams, older adults may be less willing or able to report a scam. The reasons vary.

The complexity, and even uncertainty, of filing a proper tax return can stir up anxieties like, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Have I filed correctly</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Did I claim the right deductions</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Will I get audited</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Will I get stung with a tax penalty</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> are just a few—and these are the very same anxieties that criminals use as the cornerstone of their attacks.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet like so many scams, tax scams give off telltale signs that they’re indeed not on the up-and-up. You have ways you can spot one before you get caught up in one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Still, that wariness of the IRS makes for ripe pickings when it comes to hackers, who prey on people’s fear of audits and penalties. Common scams include email phishing attacks, phone calls from crooks posing as IRS agents, texts claiming there’s a problem with our tax software, and even robocalls that threaten jail time for unpaid back taxes. What’s more, fraudsters can take things a step further by committing identity theft and then filing tax claims in other people’s names.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As for scam calls that pose as financial services companies or tax preparers, ignore them.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way you can be sure that someone other than the IRS has reached you is if they contact you by text, messaging app, or social media.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another increasingly popular scam on phones is the bogus account alert.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now during tax season, they’ll masquerade as IRS agents or popular tax software companies. Even though the names change, the game remains the same.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Other signs are related to employment, such as getting assigned an Employer Identification Number even though you didn’t request one, discovering that the IRS shows you received income from an employer you didn’t work for, or finding out that someone has claimed unemployment benefits in your name.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your Social Security number ranks at the very top of your most valuable personal information. It unlocks everything from driver’s licenses, photo identification, employment, insurance claims, and of course taxes. Act immediately if you think it’s been compromised. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Six ways you can protect yourself from tax fraud</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) File your tax return A.S.A.P.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to protect yourself from an identity thief from claiming a return in your name is to file yours before they do. As mentioned, many victims of identity theft find out they’ve been scammed when they receive an IRS notification that their tax claim has already been filed. Simply put, file early.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Get an IRS PIN.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way you can help prevent someone from filing a return in your name is to request a six-digit Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). Once you receive am IP PIN, the IRS will use it to verify your identity when you file by paper or electronically. It’s good for one calendar year, and you can generate a new one each year for your account. You can request an IP PIN at: </span><a href="https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&amp;originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov.mcas.ms%2Fidentity-theft-fraud-scams%2Fget-an-identity-protection-pin%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&amp;McasCSRF=8abd891431408f0325b8f79da9d7825e02c864633b4e97933b65096847856cc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also be aware that scammers want your IP PIN as well. Phone calls, emails, or texts asking for it are scams. Outside of including it when filing your return, the IRS will never ask for it. If you are working with a tax professional, only provide it when it comes time to file.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Keeping tabs on your credit report and knowing if your personal information has been compromised in some way can help prevent tax fraud.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">How’d that scammer get your phone number or email address anyway? Chances are, they pulled that information off a data broker site.

While streaming from free sites is less expensive than paying a monthly membership to a legitimate streaming service, you may have to pay more in the long run to reverse the damage caused by unknowingly downloading spyware. If you’re unsure if the sites you visit are safe, a safe browsing tool like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee WebAdvisor</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> will alert you to untrustworthy sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malicious apps are applications that masquerade as legitimate mobile apps but are actually a vessel to download malware onto your mobile device. For example, when </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/squid-game-app-or-mobile-malware-in-disguise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> was all the rage in 2021</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, 200 apps related to the show popped up on the Google Play store.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Avoiding malicious apps requires that you do a bit of research before downloading. Even if you’re using an authorized app store, like Google Play or the Apple Store, apps with hidden malware can pass the vetting process. One way to determine if an app is risky is to look at the quality of its reviews and its number of star ratings. Approach an app with less than 100 ratings with caution. Also, read a few of the reviews. Are they vague? Are they written poorly? Cybercriminals may pad their apps with fake reviews, but they’re unlikely to spend too much time writing well-composed comments. Finally, do a background check on the app’s developer listed in the app description. If they have a criminal reputation, a quick search will likely alert you to it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Perusing the reviews isn’t a guaranteed way to sniff out a malicious app. In 2020, McAfee discovered that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/2020-Mobile-Threat-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">one bad app had more than 7,000 reviews</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. To help prevent malware from taking hold of your device, consider investing in antivirus software. Antivirus software isn’t just for your desktop. Mobile devices benefit from it, too! </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee antivirus</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is compatible with any operating system and offers 24/7 real-time threat protection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Botnets</span></b></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What are they?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A botnet is a vast collection of malware-infected devices controlled by a cybercriminal. The criminal uses their network of bots to proliferate spam or crash servers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malware is a broad term that encompasses dozens of specific strains of malicious software, several of which are capable of recruiting your mobile device to a cybercriminal’s army of bots. Without your knowledge, the criminal can force your phone to message your contact list or divert your device’s computing power to overload a server in a cyberattack. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">All the telltale signs of malware are applicable here if your phone is part of a botnet. A botnet commander grants themselves the highest admin access to any device they take over. That means you may also see new apps on your home screen that you never downloaded or messages sent by text, email, or social media direct message that you never wrote.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Criminals recruiting devices to their botnet can embed the necessary malware anywhere malware typically lurks: in fake apps, dubious streaming and file-sharing sites, phishing emails, risky links, etc. The best way to avoid becoming a member of a botnet is to watch what you click on, stay away from risky sites, and treat any message from a stranger with suspicion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals can conceal their malware within fake software updates that look official. Fake updates often pose as Microsoft updates because of the company’s huge user base. Java and Android operating system updates have also been impersonated in the past. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The common signs of malware apply to fake software updates too. Also, if a fake update was widespread, you’ll likely receive an official correspondence from the software provider issuing a patch.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The best way to avoid being tricked by a fake update is to enable automatic updates on all your devices. When your devices auto-update, you can ignore any pop-up, email, or text that urges you to click on a link to update. Auto-update is a good practice to adopt anyway, as it ensures that you have the latest software, which often means that it’s the most secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another excellent habit that’ll prevent you from compromising your device with a fake software update is to always preview where links will take you. You can do this by tapping and holding the link. Check the hyperlink for typos or for pages that direct away from the organization’s official website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals are getting craftier by the day, employing new tools (like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpt-a-scammers-newest-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ChatGPT</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">) and new strains to trick people and infect mobile devices for their own gains.

AI art turns malicious when people use images to intentionally trick others and gain financially from the trickery.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Revealing their real face and identity could put a criminal catfish at risk of discovery, so they either use someone else’s pictures or deepfake an entire library of pictures.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Fake news propagators may also enlist the help of AI art or a deepfake to add “credibility” to their conspiracy theories. When they pair their sensationalist headlines with a photo that, at quick glance, proves its legitimacy, people may be more likely to share and spread the story. Fake news is damaging to society because of the extreme negative emotions they can generate in huge crowds. The resulting hysteria or outrage can lead to violence in some cases.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before you start an online relationship or share an apparent news story on social media, scrutinize images using these three tips to pick out malicious AI-generated art and deepfake.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Inspect the context around the image.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Fake images usually don’t appear by themselves. There’s often text or a larger article around them. Inspect the text for typos, poor grammar, and overall poor composition. Phishers are notorious for their poor writing skills. AI-generated text is more difficult to detect because its grammar and spelling are often correct; however, the sentences may seem choppy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Evaluate the claim.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Does the image seem too bizarre to be real? Too good to be true? Extend this generation’s rule of thumb of “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet” to include “Don’t believe everything you see on the internet.” If a fake news story is claiming to be real, search for the headline elsewhere. If it’s truly noteworthy, at least one other site will report on the event.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Check for distortions.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">AI technology often generates a finger or two too many on hands, and a deepfake creates eyes that may have a soulless or dead look to them. Also, there may be shadows in places where they wouldn’t be natural, and the skin tone may look uneven. In deepfaked videos, the voice and facial expressions may not exactly line up, making the subject look robotic and stiff.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;335559991&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Boost Your Online Safety With McAfee</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Fake images are tough to spot, and they’ll likely get more realistic the more the technology improves. Awareness of emerging AI threats better prepares you to take control of your online life. There are quizzes online that compare deepfake and AI art with genuine people and artworks created by humans. When you have a spare ten minutes, consider taking a quiz and recognizing your mistakes to identify malicious fake art in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

While it might seem like a given, McAfee was the first cybersecurity company to reach this goal, and that work continues, particularly in a time where pay gaps persist.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And they certainly persist. Stubbornly so. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/">Recent data from Pew Research</a> indicates that women in the U.S. make 82 cents for every $1 men earn, a figure that has only increased by two cents in the last two decades. At the current rate, women overall will not reach pay parity until 2059.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We believe no one should have to wait.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At McAfee, we’re proud to demonstrate our commitment to an equitable and inclusive workplace with our ongoing attainment of pay parity. In 2019, we achieved gender pay parity before adding ethnicity to our analysis a year later. Today we’re proud to say that all McAfee team members are compensated fairly and equally for their contributions, regardless of gender or ethnicity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an equitable environment is part of our DNA and who we are. In fact, half of the McAfee leadership team are female and, together with their male counterparts (including myself), are committed to driving diversity at every level. Whether it’s through our Diversity Impact Analysis, where awards, promotions, or employee programs are analyzed through the lens of equality and equity; or our candidate interviews where a woman is on every panel; or our comprehensive employee benefits and offerings centered around the needs of a diverse workforce — we’re proud of the progress we’re making, while knowing there is still much to do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Countless studies point to the ways <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">diversity across gender and ethnicity correlates with business performance.</a> At McAfee, we do it first and foremost because we simply believe it’s the right thing to do. Achieving and maintaining pay parity is not without its challenges. It takes effort. Ongoing effort. If left unchecked, we know that the pay divide can resurface overtime, whether through our own unconscious biases or other factors, such as fewer women negotiating starting salaries than men. We must be proactive and intentional to maintain parity. This means quarterly analyses, third-party audits to help identify and address potential bias and subjectivity, and immediate action when we identify discrepancies to ensure the divide remains closed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At McAfee, we will continue to shape our hiring practices, talent management practices, internal mobility, promotion and award programs, and other practices in a way that creates an employee experience rooted in equity and inclusion, so that all McAfee team members can do the best work of their lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re honored to play our part in the broader movement toward equality.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite our vastly different life experiences and philosophies, there’s something that people of any age should get behind: identity and online privacy protection. Young or old, cybercriminals don’t discriminate against who they target. In fact, some generations are more prone to certain scams than others.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals can steal identities even from young children who don’t yet have an online presence. Criminals can buy Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of minors on the dark web or gather them through medical record or school system breaches. Those SSNs are valuable to a cybercriminal, because the theft can go undetected for years. Since children aren’t opening credit cards or applying for mortgages, there’s seemingly no reason to keep tabs on their credit and ensure everything is normal. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The best advice to adults to avoid phishing or malicious bugs is this: slow down! Take your time when you receive any message from someone you don’t know or have never met in person. If you feel even an iota of suspicion, don’t engage any further with the sender. Delete the message. If it’s important, the person or organization will follow up. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To fully protect expensive connected devices and the personally identifiable information they store, consider investing in safe browsing, antivirus software, and identity monitoring and restoration services to catch any threats that may have passed under your watchful eye.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Seniors</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cybercriminals often seek out seniors as easy targets for online scams. Because they aren’t digital natives like millennials and Gen Zers, seniors are typically less confident in their online skills. For example, they may not realize that every email in their inbox isn’t necessarily sent by someone with good intentions. What can start out as a friendly online pen pal can quickly spiral into divulging sensitive personal information or sending huge sums of money to a criminal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Whether it be a smartphone or a flip phone, these devices have truly shaped the late 20th century and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. But while users have become accustomed to having almost everything they could ever want at fingertips length, cybercriminals were busy setting up shop. To trick unsuspecting users, cybercriminals have set up crafty mobile threats – some that users may not even be fully aware of. These sneaky cyberthreats include SMSishing, fake networks, malicious apps, and grayware, which have all grown in sophistication over time. This means users need to be equipped with the know-how to navigate the choppy waters that come with these smartphone-related cyberthreats. Let’s get started.</p>
<h3><strong>Watch out for SMSishing Hooks </strong></h3>
<p>If you use email, then you are probably familiar with what phishing is. And while phishing is commonly executed through email and malicious links, there is a form of phishing that specifically targets mobile devices called <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2018/09/26/smishing-the-new-more-dangerous-form-of-phishing.html">SMSishing</a>. This growing threat allows cybercriminals to utilize messaging apps to send unsuspecting users a SMSishing message. These messages serve one purpose – to obtain personal information, such as logins and financial information. With that information, cybercriminals could impersonate the user to access banking records or steal their identity.</p>
<p>While this threat was once a rarity, its the rise in popularity is two-fold. The first aspect is that users have been educated to distrust email messages and the second is the rise in mobile phone usage throughout the world. Although this threat shows no sign of slowing down, there are ways to avoid a cybercriminal’s SMSishing hooks. Get started with these tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always double-check the message’s source.</strong> If you receive a text from your bank or credit card company, call the organization directly to ensure the message is legit.</li>
<li><strong>Delete potential SMSishing</strong> Do not reply to or click on any links within a suspected malicious text, as that could lead to more SMSishing attempts bombarding your phone.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in comprehensive mobile security. </strong>Adding an <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs">extra level of security</a> can not only help protect your device but can also notify you when a threat arises.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Public Wi-Fi Woes  </strong></h3>
<p>Public and free Wi-Fi is practically everywhere nowadays, with some destinations even having city-wide Wi-Fi set up. But that Wi-Fi users are connecting their mobile device to may not be the most secure, given cybercriminals can exploit weaknesses in these networks to intercept messages, login credentials, or other personal information. Beyond exploiting weaknesses, some cybercriminals take it a step further and create fake networks with generic names that trick unsuspecting users into connecting their devices. These networks are called <a href="https://hackablepodcast.com/episodes/the-evil-twin">“evil-twin” networks</a>. For help in spotting these imposters, there are few tricks the savvy user can deploy to prevent an evil twin network from wreaking havoc on their mobile device:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for password-protected networks.</strong> As strange as it sounds, if you purposely enter the incorrect password but are still allowed access, the network is most likely a fraud.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to page load times. </strong>If the network you are using is very slow, it is more likely a cybercriminal is using an unreliable mobile hotspot to connect your mobile device to the web.</li>
<li><strong>Use a virtual private network or VPN. </strong>While you’re on-the-go and using public Wi-Fi, add an <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra layer of security</a> in the event you accidentally connect to a malicious network. VPNs can encrypt your online activity and keep it away from prying eyes.<strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Malicious Apps: Fake It till They Make It </strong></h3>
<p>Fake apps have become a rampant problem for Android and iPhone users alike. This is mainly in part due to <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/mobile-and-iot-security/fake-apps-taking-over-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malicious apps</a> hiding in plain sight on legitimate sources, such as the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. After users download a faulty app, cybercriminals deploy malware that operates in the background of mobile devices which makes it difficult for users to realize anything is wrong. And while users think they’ve just downloaded another run-of-the-mill app, the malware is hard at work obtaining personal data.</p>
<p>In order to keep sensitive information out of the hands of cybercriminals, here are a few things users can look for when they need to determine whether an app is fact or fiction:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check for typos and poor grammar.</strong> Always check the app developer name, product title, and description for typos and grammatical errors. Often, malicious developers will spoof real developer IDs, even just by a single letter or number, to seem legitimate.</li>
<li><strong>Examine the download statistics.</strong> If you’re attempting to download a popular app, but it has a surprisingly low number of downloads, that is a good indicator that an app is most likely fake.</li>
<li><strong>Read the reviews.</strong> With malicious apps, user reviews are your friend. By reading a few, you can receive vital information that can help you determine whether the app is fake or not.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>The Sly Operation of Grayware</strong></h3>
<p>With so many types of malware out in the world, it’s hard to keep track of them all. But there is one in particular that mobile device users need to be keenly aware of called <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/the-not-so-black-and-white-of-grayware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grayware</a>. As a coverall term for software or code that sits between normal and malicious, grayware comes in many forms, such as adware, spyware or madware. While adware and spyware can sometimes operate simultaneously on infected computers, madware — or adware on mobile devices — infiltrates smartphones by hiding within rogue apps. Once a mobile device is infected with madware from a malicious app, ads can infiltrate almost every aspect on a user’s phone. Madware isn’t just annoying; it also is a security and privacy risk, as some threats will try to obtain users’ data. To avoid the annoyance, as well as the cybersecurity risks of grayware, users can prepare their devices with these cautionary steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be sure to update your device.</strong> Grayware looks for vulnerabilities that can be exploited, so be sure to always keep your device’s software up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of rogue apps.</strong> As mentioned in the previous section, fake apps are now a part of owning a smartphone. Use the tips in the above section to ensure you keep malicious apps off of your device that may contain grayware.</li>
<li><strong>Consider a comprehensive mobile security system. </strong>By adding an <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra level of security</a>, you can help protect your devices from threats, both old and new.</li>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The PC Mag review gave McAfee+ a thorough walkthrough with a particular focus on its privacy and identity features, saying, “McAfee+ is now the most complete product in the McAfee line, and its combination of unlimited device protection with identity theft remediation is quite appealing.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

From an entire attack campaign on <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3169413/security/recent-malware-attacks-on-polish-banks-tied-to-wider-hacking-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banks worldwide,</a> to a strain residing <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/medjack3-poses-advanced-threat-to-hospital-devices/d/d-id/1328172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within medical devices</a>, to a variant that has learned to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-discover-self-healing-malware-that-targets-magento-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-heal</a>, the list of malware-based attacks goes on. And as they do, it’s becoming more and more clear that today’s malware has not only become adaptive, but has learned how to spread its wings further than before, to devices beyond laptops and phones, and in a way that creates a longevity behind each cyberattack it spearheads.</p>
<p>However, though it is important to understand the many forms that malware, or malicious software, takes, it’s crucial to first and foremost grasp what it is.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Malware?</strong></h2>
<p>The abbreviated term for malicious software, “malware,” is a generic term used to describe any type of software or code specifically designed to exploit a computer/mobile device or the data it contains, without consent. Most malware is designed to have some financial gain for the cybercriminal, as crooks typically use it to extract data that they can leverage over victims. That information can range anywhere from financial data, to healthcare records, to personal emails and passwords—the possibilities of what sort of information can be compromised have become endless.</p>
<h2><strong>How Malware Spreads</strong></h2>
<p>So how exactly can these cybercriminals get their hands on so much data? Since its birth over 30 years ago, malware has found a variety of vessels to help it enact attacks. This includes email attachments, malicious advertisements on popular sites (malvertising), fake software installations, USB drives, infected apps, phishing emails, and even text messages.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Malware </strong></h2>
<p>Now, these are just a few of the ways malicious software can be delivered–but there are also different kinds of malware itself. To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viruses.</strong> Almost always attached in a file, this malware variant usually comes as a document in an email that holds a virus payload (the part of malware that performs the malicious action). Once the victim opens the file, boom—infected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Worms.</strong> This malware strain doesn’t require user interaction or even a file to attack. Instead, worms have the ability to copy themselves from machine to machine, usually by exploiting some sort of security weakness in a software or operating system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trojans.</strong> This type of malware is the most commonly leveraged by cybercriminals, as of late. Trojans masquerade as harmless applications (for example, those you’d use on your phone), tricking users into downloading and using them. Once up and running, they then can steal personal data, crash a device, spy on the someone’s activities, or even launch a DDoS attack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ransomware.</strong> One of the most profitable, and therefore one of the most popular, of malware types amongst cybercriminals is ransomware. This variant simply installs itself onto a victim’s machine, encrypts their files, and then turns around and demands a ransom (usually in Bitcoin) to return that data to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How You Can Fight Back </strong></h2>
<p>Now that you know what malware is, how it can be delivered, and the many forms it takes, it’s time to learn how you can <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect yourself</a> against it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your operating system and applications updated</strong>. Cybercriminals look for vulnerabilities in old or outdated software to capitalize on, so make sure you install updates as soon as they become available since they can close security holes that may have been exposed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid clicking on unknown links. </strong>Whether it comes via email, a social networking site, or a text message, if a link seems unfamiliar, keep away from it. This especially goes for links that come from someone you don’t know.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be selective about which sites you visit. </strong>Do your best to only use known and trusted sites, as well as using comprehensive security packages such as  <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Ultimate</a>, to avoid any sites that may in fact be malicious without your knowing. <strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Same goes for what apps you download</strong>. When looking for your next favorite app, make sure you only download something that checks out. Read app reviews, utilize only official app stores, and if something comes off as remotely fishy, steer clear.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be alert</strong>. Cybercriminals depend on laziness and inattentiveness–so prove them wrong. Don’t believe manipulative emails, don’t leave your computer unattended, and most importantly, stay educated on the kinds of malware that could come your way.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned, these are big breaches with big companies that we likely more than recognize. Yet smaller and mid-sized businesses are targets as well, </span><a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/10-small-business-cyber-security-statistics-that-you-should-know-and-how-to-improve-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">with some 43% of data breaches involving companies of that size</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Likewise, </span><a href="https://upserve.com/restaurant-insider/pos-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">restaurants and retailers have seen their Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals compromised</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, right on down to neighborhood restaurants. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Staying secure in light of data breaches </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When a company experiences a data breach, customers need to realize that this could impact their online safety. If your favorite coffee shop’s customer database gets leaked, there’s a chance that your personal or financial information was exposed. However, this doesn’t mean that your online safety is doomed. If you think you were affected by a breach, you can take several steps to protect yourself from the potential side effects.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Keep an eye on your bank and credit card accounts </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the most effective ways to determine whether someone is fraudulently using one or more of your accounts is to check your statements. If you see any charges that you did not make, report them to your bank or credit card company immediately. They have processes in place to handle fraud. While you’re with them, see if they offer alerts for strange purchases, transactions, or withdrawals. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Our credit monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can help you keep an eye on this. It monitors changes to your credit score, report, and accounts with timely notifications and guidance so you can take action to tackle identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Monitor your identity with the help of a service</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Breached and stolen information often ends up in dark web marketplaces where hackers, scammers, and thieves purchase it to commit yet more crime. Once it was difficult to know if your information was caught up in such marketplaces, yet now </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-monitoring/path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">an identity monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can do the detective work for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our service monitors the dark web for your personal info, including email, government IDs, credit card and bank account info, and more. This can help keep your personal info safe with early alerts that show you if your data is found on the dark web, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​ From there, you’ll get guidance that you can act on, which can help protect your info and accounts from theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Place a fraud alert</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you suspect that your data might have been compromised, place a fraud alert on your credit. This not only ensures that any new or recent requests undergo scrutiny, but also allows you to have extra copies of your credit report so you can check for suspicious activity. You can place one fraud alert with any of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and they will notify the other two. A fraud alert typically lasts for a year, although there are options for extending it as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Look into freezing your credit if needed </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Freezing your credit will make it highly difficult for criminals to take out loans or open new accounts in your name, as a freeze halts all requests to pull your credit—even legitimate ones. In this way, it’s a far stronger measure than placing a fraud alert. Note that if you plan to take out a loan, open a new credit card, or other activity that will prompt a credit report, you’ll need to take extra steps to see that through while the freeze is in place. (The organization you’re working with can assist with the specifics.) Unlike the fraud alert, you’ll need to contact each major credit reporting agency to put one in place. Also, a freeze lasts as long as you have it in place. You’ll have to remove it yourself, again with each agency. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/security-freeze?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">You can centrally manage this process with our security freeze service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which stops companies from looking at your credit profile, and thus halts the application process for loans, credit cards, utilities, new bank accounts, and more. A security freeze won&#8217;t affect your credit score. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Update your passwords </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique. Many people utilize the same password or variations of it across all their accounts. Therefore, be sure to diversify your passcodes to ensure hackers cannot obtain access to all your accounts at once, should one password be compromised. You can also employ a password manager to keep track of your credentials, such as the one </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you’ll find in comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Consider taking out identity theft coverage </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If the unfortunate happens to you, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-theft-coverage?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">an identity theft coverage &amp; restoration service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can help you get back on your feet. Ours offers $1 million in coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, and stolen funds reimbursement. It further provides support from a licensed recovery expert who can take the needed steps to repair your identity and credit. In all, it helps you recover the costs of identity theft along with the time and money it takes to recover from it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Clean up your personal data online</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can take this step any time, even if you haven’t been caught up in a data breach. The fact is that data broker companies collect and sell thousands of pieces of information on millions and millions of people worldwide, part of </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global economy estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars a year</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. And they’ll sell it to anyone—from advertisers for their campaigns, to scammers who will use it for spammy emails, texts, and calls, and to thieves who use that information for identity theft. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet you can clean it up. Our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personal data cleanup service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can scan some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and, with select products, even manage the removal for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">8. Use online protection software and expand your security toolbox </span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> will offer you the tools and services listed above, along with further features that can protect you online. That includes a VPN to keep your time online more private from online data collection while protecting it from thieves who’re out to steal credit card and account information. It also includes web browsing protection that can warn you of sketchy websites and malicious downloads that look to steal your information. In all, it’s thorough protection for your devices, privacy, and identity. And in a time of data breaches, that kind of protection has become essential.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">And money is what it’s all about. Hackers and scammers generally want your money, or they want your data and personal info that they can turn into money. Creating fraudulent ads, stealing user credentials, or skimming personal information are some of the most common swindles that these apps try. Much of this can happen in the background, often without victims knowing it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">How do these apps end up on people’s phones? Sometimes they’re downloaded from third-party app stores, which may not have a rigorous review process in place to spot malicious apps—or the third-party store may be a front for distributing malware-laden apps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">They also find their way into legitimate app stores, like Apple’s App Store and Google Play. While these stores indeed have review processes in place to weed out malicious apps, hackers and scammers have found workarounds. Sometimes they upload an app that’s initially clean and then push the malware to users as part of an update. Other times, they embed the malicious code so that it only triggers once it’s run in certain countries. They will also encrypt bad code in the app that they submit, which can make it difficult for stores to sniff out. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, our report cites several primary ways how hackers and scammers are turning to apps today:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

But even legitimate communication apps can create an opportunity for scammers. They will use fraudulent messages to trick consumers into clicking on a malicious link, trying to get them to share login credentials, account numbers, or personal information. While these messages sometimes contain spelling or grammar errors or use odd phrasing, the emergence of AI tools like ChatGPT can help scammers clean up their spelling and grammar mistakes, making it tougher to spot scam messages by mistakes in the content. The severity of these Communication threats is also evident in the volume of adults (66%) who have been messaged by a stranger on social media, with 55% asked to transfer money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Work-related apps for mobile devices are great productivity boosters—categories like PDF editors, VPNs, messaging managers, document scanners, battery boosters, and memory cleaners. These types of apps are targeted for malware because people expect the app to require permissions on their phone. Scammers will set up the app to ask for permissions to storage, messaging, calendars, contacts, location, and even system settings, which scammers to retrieve all sorts of work-related information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Malicious apps often target things that children and teens like, such as gaming, making videos, and managing social media. The most common types of threats detected within the gaming category in 2022 were aggressive adware—apps that display excessive advertisements while using the app and even when you&#8217;re not using it. It’s important to make sure that kids’ phones are either restricted from downloading new apps, or that they’re informed and capable of questioning suspicious apps and identifying fraudulent ones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How you can avoid downloading malicious and fake apps</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For starters, stick with legitimate apps stores like</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Google Play and Apple’s App Store, which have measures in place to review and vet apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure. And for the malicious apps that sneak past these processes, Google and Apple are quick to remove malicious apps once discovered, making their stores that much safer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Review with a critical eye.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with so many attacks, hackers rely on people clicking links or tapping “download” without a second thought. Before you download, take time to do some quick research. That may uncover some signs that the app is malicious. Check out the developer—have they published several other apps with many downloads and good reviews? A legit app typically has quite a few reviews, whereas malicious apps may have only a handful of (phony) five-star reviews. Lastly, look for typos and poor grammar in both the app description and screenshots. They could be a sign that a hacker slapped the app together and quickly deployed it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Go with a strong recommendation.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet better than combing through user reviews yourself is getting a recommendation from a trusted source, like a well-known publication or from app store editors themselves. In this case, much of the vetting work has been done for you by an established reviewer. A quick online search like “best fitness apps” or “best apps for travelers” should turn up articles from legitimate sites that can suggest good options and describe them in detail before you download.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Keep an eye on app permissions.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way hackers weasel their way into your device is by getting permissions to access things like your location, contacts, and photos—and they’ll use sketchy apps to do it. So, check and see what permissions the app is requesting. If it’s asking for way more than you bargained for, like a simple game wanting access to your camera or microphone, it may be a scam. Delete the app and find a legitimate one that doesn’t ask for invasive permissions like that. If you’re curious about permissions for apps that are already on your phone, </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-access-to-information-in-apps-iph251e92810/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">iPhone users can learn how to allow or revoke app permission here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9431959?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Android can do the same here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Protect your smartphone with security software.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all that we do on our phones, it’s important to get security software installed on them, just like we install it on our computers and laptops. Whether you go with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that secures all your devices or </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wsandroid.suite&amp;shortlink=mmsandroid&amp;pid=Web&amp;c=Home%20page%20mobile%20blade%20-%20Android%20CTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">pick up an app in Google Play</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mcafee-mobile-security/id724596345#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple’s App Store</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, you’ll have malware, web, and device security that’ll help you stay safe on your phone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) Update your phone’s operating system</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Together with installing security software, keeping your phone’s operating system up to date can help to keep you protected from most malware. Updates can fix vulnerabilities that hackers rely on to pull off their malware-based attacks—it’s another tried and true method of keeping yourself safe and your phone running great too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">ChatGPT is an online software program that uses a new form of artificial intelligence &#8211; generative artificial intelligence &#8211; to provide human style responses to a broad array of requests.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When I asked ChatGPT to describe itself, it replied:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It&#8217;s based on the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) architecture, which is one of the largest and most advanced language models in existence. The model has been trained on a massive corpus of text data from the internet, allowing it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics and questions. It can be used to power various applications such as chatbots, language translation, content generation, and more.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let me simplify – ChatGPT uses generative artificial intelligence to provide ‘human style’ content, language translation, summarisation ability and search engine results within seconds. It can solve maths questions, write jokes, develop a resume and cover letter, write code and even help you prepare for a job interview.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Does It Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">ChatGPT is powered by a large language model, or LLM, meaning it’s programmed to understand human language and create responses based on large quantities of data. It has the ability to remember or ‘log’ context from a user’s previous message and use it to create responses later in the conversation, giving it a human-like feel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Popular is it?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just five days after its release, Chap GPT had signed up 1 million users, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">according to a tweet by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In just two months, it had amassed a whopping 100 million monthly active users making it </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-fastest-growing#:~:text=OpenAI's%20artificial%20intelligence%20chatbot%20ChatGPT,visitors%20it%20had%20in%20December." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the fastest growing application in history</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. And just to give you some context, it took TikTok nine months to reach 100 million users and two and half years for Instagram.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Without doubt, the main reasons for its popularity is the ease of access and its seemingly endless scope of ability. It’s super easy to use – once you’ve </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">set up an account</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, it’s as simple as typing in your request or question into the text box. And there is no minimum age required for users &#8211; unlike many other social media platforms. And because it can assist with any issue from writing a legal brief to answering questions to providing companionship </span><a href="https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-languages-does-chatgpt-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">in almost 100 languages</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a lot of us could easily find a way to use it in our day-to-day lives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some experts believe that the timing of ChatGPT is another reason for its success. It’s widely known that the Renaissance period followed The Black Death in the 14</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Century so ChatGPT could have arrived at a time in history when creativity is surging after 2-3 very long and hard years of living with Covid.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">ChatGPT is still a free service however recently it has introduced a premium version called ChatGPT Plus. For $US20 per month, users will get access to the chatbot even when demand is high with a faster response speed. Priority access to new features will also be made available to new users. While I have never had an issue gaining access to ChatGPT, even in peak times, friends of mine in the US have had to invest in the paid membership otherwise they have to wait till late in the evening to have their questions answered!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft recently announced that it will be incorporating some of the ChatGPT functionality into its Bing and Edge search engines but that it will use a next generation OpenAI model that is more powerful than ChatGPT. If you’re a Microsoft customer, </span><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/bing-users-will-be-able-to-test-out-the-integrated-chatgpt/"><span data-contrast="none">keep a watch on your inbox for an invite</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Google has just unveiled its offering. Called Bard, it’s similar to ChatGPT but the biggest difference is that it will use current information from the web whereas ChatGPT’s data sources are only current as of September 2021 – I did confirm that with my ChatGPT source!! Bard is projected to be ready for use by the end of February 2023. Interestingly, Google was in fact the first to embrace conversational AI through the launch of Lamda (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) in 2021 but it didn’t launch a consumer version which left a wide opening for ChatGPT to be the first offering in the consumer race.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">As a Parent, What Should I Be Concerned About?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s no doubt that ChatGPT will help fuel a curious mind and be a captivating way to spend time online for inquisitive kids however there are a few things us parents need to be aware of to ensure our kids stay as safe as possible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. When ChatGPT Can Do Your Homework</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Without a doubt, using ChatGPT to write your essay, solve a maths problem or translate your French homework, has been the biggest concern for schools, universities, and parents. Some schools have already banned the use of ChatGPT while others are rewriting curriculums to avoid tasks that could be undertaken by ChatGPT. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, it appears that these concerns may be managed with the release of new software that can detect work that has been produced by ChatGPT. Stanford University has just released </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/detectgpt-to-help-teachers-detect-content-generated-using-chatgpt-by-students/articleshow/97438221.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">DetectGPT</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> which will help teachers detect work that was created using the ChatGPT chatbot or other similar large language models (LLMs). </span><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/cheaters-on-notice-chatgpt-creator-releases-ai-detection-tool-20230201-p5ch1v.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ChatGPT has also released its own ChatGPT software detection tool</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> however it does refer to it as ‘imperfect’.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What To Do – Some experts believe we need to work with ChatGPT and that it in fact could be a powerful teaching tool if it’s embraced and used wisely. Regardless of your thoughts on this, I suggest you work closely with your child’s school to understand what their policy is on its use and encourage your kids to follow it accordingly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Inappropriate Content</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even though ChatGPT states that its intention is to ‘generate appropriate and informative responses’, there’s no guarantee that this will always happen. I have spent a considerable time trying to catch it out and I am pleased to report that I couldn’t. It appears that there are certain topics it steers away from and that it does seem to have a good set of boundaries about what questions not to answer or topics to not content on, however don’t rely on these!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What To Do &#8211; If you have concerns, ensure your child has supervision when using ChatGPT.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Chat GPT Doesn’t Always Get It Right</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While ChatGPT’s IQ and scope seems limitless, it isn’t perfect. Not only have there been reports of it being factually incorrect when creating content, its data sources are only current as at September 2021.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What To Do – Double check the content it creates for accuracy but steer your child towards a reliable and safe source for research projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And my final piece of advice – if you haven’t yet used ChatGPT, make yourself a cuppa and give it a whirl. Like everything in the online world, you need to understand how it works if you want to be able to help your kids stay safe. And if you aren’t sure what to ask it – why not a recipe for dinner? Simply enter what you can find in your fridge in the text box and within seconds, you’ll have a recipe!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bon Appetit!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Should you wait until they start high school or until they catch public transport home alone from school? Or, should 10 be the magic age when they become official phone owners? Or do hold off as long as you can until you can no longer bear their moaning that everyone else has one except for them!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How I Made The Decision</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When my boys were younger (and I knew a little less), we had a family ‘understanding’ that when the boys started Year 5, they would receive a (very cheap and likely second hand) phone. Up until Year 5, my boys would go to after-school care. Somehow, turning 10 and entering Middle School meant after-school care wasn’t really that ‘cool’ anymore, so instead they required a phone so they could safely catch the train home by themselves. The fact that they could also use these devices to play games and talk to their friends was of course, only a secondary consideration for them! </span><span data-contrast="auto"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That was how we managed the phone situation but let me assure you, almost every other family we knew had a different approach. Some gifted their offspring the latest iPhones as soon as they were requested, others provided a phone but with no ‘credit’ so the devices could only be used to receive calls. Others chose to wait till Year 7 and beyond and made their kids pay for the phone plan out of their pocket money. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, I’m a big fan of parents choosing what works best – no one knows a child quite like a parent does, right? But the problem is, deciding what’s right can be really overwhelming. So, I’ve put together a list of things to consider when making this all important decision. Once you’ve worked through these points, I am sure you’ll feel more confident to make a decision that works for both you and your child.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Responsible and Savvy Is Your Child?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Having parented 4 very different boys, I am the first to confirm that every child grasps personal responsibility at different stages. Some kids just have a knack for losing things while others have the same lunchbox their entire school career! Some kids just get the consequence of spending money while others spend up big whilst gaming online, blissfully unaware of their bill. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You child’s digital reputation should also be worth considering when making your decision. Some kids understand that their online behaviour forms a key part of their reputation while others will charge forth in a heated online exchange without thinking. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I really believe there is a direct link between social smarts and a positive online experience. When a child can read a situation and instinctively know when to shut it down or withdraw, their online experience will be far more rewarding. If your child is slow to catch on to social cues, they may struggle with posting and communicating online.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Will A Phone Really Help With Safety?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When I was deliberating about giving my eldest son a phone, he really went hard with the safety argument – knowing it would appeal to my parental anxiety. So, I relented but he had to promise to answer when I called. And he did – usually!! But it’s worth pointing out that a device itself doesn’t guarantee safety. If your kids are travelling home from school, they still need to know how to cross the road, not to talk to strangers and to always lock the front door once home. A phone doesn’t teach this. But I personally did find it handy (and anxiety reducing) to be able to give them a quick call to give them a few reminders and ensure all was well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When my younger boys received their phones, tracking apps like </span><a href="https://www.life360.com/intl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Life 360</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> were available. I know, they are controversial but, personally I found these super helpful. Being able to see where they were after school and to ensure they were heading in the right direction on the train, brought me great comfort to me when I was beating away on my keyboard at work. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Could A ‘Dumb Phone’ Or Parental Controls Help?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If, after reading this, you’re thinking that your child really isn’t ready but still love the idea of being able to contact them, why not consider parental controls or a phone with limited features? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Putting age-appropriate boundaries around what your child does on their device is what parental controls will do. If you decide that you don’t want them to download TikTok, play particular games or view certain categories of websites, then this maybe your answer. You can also choose to set limits on their daily screen time and block out times when their phone can’t be used. Check out </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s SafeFamily</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> parental controls for peace of mind.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Or, instead, why not make a ‘dumb’ phone their only option? A basic dumb phone lacks the advanced functionality of most smartphones – think phones before the internet. This means you’ll be able to call and text them but will probably be more relaxed knowing they’re not researching the latest fads on TikTok! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some companies have designed dumb phones for kids that even have built in parental controls. </span><a href="https://www.opelmobile.com.au/our-products/smart-kids-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Open Mobile has a SmartKids Phone</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> with a built-in GPS tracker and SOS button and comes without a camera. It does have internet connectivity but parents can see which apps have been downloaded, restrict specific apps and nominate what days and times apps can be used. A perfect option for a tween or young teenager!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Connection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, before making your final decision, I think it’s essential to think about your child’s sense of connectedness. As adults, we all know that being part of a community and ‘belonging’ is critical to mental health and self-worth. And I would not be doing my job if I didn’t remind you of just how fabulous a phone can be for staying in touch with your people. Just take a moment to remember how essential devices were for survival during Covid lockdowns. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, over to you mums and dads. This is definitely one of the trickiest decisions you’ll make in your parenting journey but don’t forget that you know your child best. You’ve got this!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Scammers will capitalize on any opportunity to fleece a victim, like the holidays with ecommerce scams and tax time with IRS scams. Now, with </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">surging employment figures</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, scammers have turned to job scams that harvest money and personal information from job seekers.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In some ways, the tactics bear resemblance to online dating and romance scammers who hide behind a phony profile and tell their victims a story they want to hear, namely that someone loves them. With job scams, they take on the persona of a recruiter and lure their victims with what seems like an outstanding job offer. Of course, there’s no job. It’s a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These attacks have gained a degree of sophistication that they once lacked. Years prior, scammers relied on spammy emails and texts to share their bogus job offers. Now, they’re using phony profiles on social media platforms to target victims.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Social media platforms have several mechanisms in place to identity and delete the phony profiles that scammers use for these attacks. Of note, </span><a href="https://about.linkedin.com/transparency/community-report#fake-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">LinkedIn’s latest community report cited the removal of more than 21 million fake accounts in the first half of 2022</span></a><span data-contrast="none">:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Likewise, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook/#content-actioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.5 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> in Q3 of 2022 alone, with more than 99% of them acted on before users reported them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Still, some scammers make their way through.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Job scams continue to rise. Here’s what to look out for.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As Steve Grobman, our senior vice president and chief technology officer, was quoted </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/fake-online-recruiters-looking-to-scam-job-seekers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">in an article for CNET</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, the continued shift to remote work, along with remote hiring, has also made it easier for online job scams to flourish. And the figures bear that out.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In 2021, the FTC called out $209 million in reported losses due to job scams. In just the first three quarters of 2022, reported job scam losses had already reached $250 million. While year-end figures have yet to be posted, </span><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/TheBigViewAllSentinelReports/TopReports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the final tally for 2022 could end up well over $300 million</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, a 50% uptick. And the median loss per victim? Right around $2,000 each.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While the promise of work or a job offer make these scams unique, the scammers behind them want the same old things—your money, along with your personal information so that they can use it to cause yet more harm. The moment any so-called job offer asks for any of those, a red flag should immediately go up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s possibly a scam if:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">They ask for your Social Security or tax ID number.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the hands of a scammer, your SSN or tax ID is the master key to your identity. With it, they can open up bank cards, lines of credit, apply for insurance benefits, collect benefits and tax returns, or even commit crimes, all in your name. Needless to say, scammers will ask for it, perhaps under the guise of background check or for payroll purposes. The only time you should provide your SSN or tax ID is when you know that you have accepted a legitimate job with a legitimate company, and through a secure document signing service, never via email, text, or over the phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">They want your banking information.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another trick scammers rely on is asking for bank account information so that they can wire payment to you. As with the SSN above, closely guard this information and treat it in exactly the same way. Don’t give it out unless you actually have a legitimate job with a legitimate company.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">They want you to pay before you get paid.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Some scammers will take a different route. They’ll promise employment, but first you’ll need to pay them for training, onboarding, or equipment before you can start work. Legitimate companies won’t make these kinds of requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Other signs of a job scam—more red flags to look for.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Aside from the types of information they ask for, the way they ask for your information offers other clues that you might be mixed up in a scam. Look out for the following as well:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) The offer is big on promises but short on details.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can sniff out many online scams with the “too good to be true” test. Scammers often make big promises during the holidays with low-priced offers for hard-to-get holiday gifts and then simply don’t deliver. It’s the same with job scams. The high pay, the low hours, and even the offer of things like a laptop and other perks, these are signs that a job offer might be a scam. Moreover, when pressed for details about this seemingly fantastic job opportunity, scammers may balk. Or they may come back with incomplete or inconsistent replies because the job doesn’t exist at all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) They communicate only through email or chat.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Job scammers hide behind their screens. They use the anonymity of the internet to their advantage. Job scammers likewise create phony profiles on networking and social media websites, which means they won’t agree to a video chat or call, which are commonly used in legitimate recruiting today. If your job offer doesn’t involve some sort of face-to-face communication, that’s an indication it may be a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) And the communications seem a little … off.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Scammers now have an additional tool reel in their victims—AI chatbots like Chat GPT, which can generate email correspondence, chats, LinkedIn profiles, and other content in seconds so they can bilk victims on a huge scale. However, AI has its limits. Right now, it tends to use shorter sentences in a way that seems like it’s simply spitting out information. There’s little story or substance to the content it creates. That may be a sign of a scam. Likewise, even without AI, you may spot a recruiter using technical or job-related terms in an unusual ways, as if they’re unfamiliar with the work they’re hiring for. That’s another potential sign.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4) Things move too quickly.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Scammers love a quick conversion. Yet job seekers today know that interview processes are typically long and involved, often relying on several rounds of interviews and loops. If a job offer comes along without the usual rigor and the recruiter is asking for personal information practically right away, that’s another near-certain sign of a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5) You get a job offers on Facebook or other social media sites not associated with job searches.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This is another red flag. Legitimate businesses stick to platforms associated with networking for business purposes, typically not networking for families, friends, and interests. Why do scammers use sites like Facebook anyway? They’re a gold mine of information. By trolling public profiles, they have access to years of posts and armloads of personal information on thousands of people, which they can use to target their attacks. This is another good reason to set your social media profiles on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and other friend-oriented sites to private so that scammers of all kinds, not just job scammers, can’t use your information against you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Further ways you can protect yourself from job scams.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As a job hunter you know, getting the right job requires some research. You look up the company, dig into their history—the work they do, how long they’ve been at it, where their locations are, and maybe even read some reviews provided by current or former employees. When it comes to job offers that come out of the blue, it calls for taking that research a step further. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">After all, is that business really a business, or is it really a scam?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the U.S., you have several resources that can help you answer that question. </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) offers a searchable listing of businesses</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> in the U.S., along with a brief profile, a rating, and even a list of complaints (and company responses) waged against them. Spending some time here can quickly shed light on the legitimacy of a company. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Also in the U.S., you can visit the website of your state’s Secretary of State and search for the business in question, where you can find when it was founded, if it’s still active, or if it exists at all. For businesses based in a state other than your own, you can visit that state’s Secretary of State website for information. For a state-by-state list of Secretaries of State, you can </span><a href="https://search-sos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">visit the Secretary of State Corporate Search page here</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/300x200_Blog_021823.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/300x200_Blog_021823.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/300x200_Blog_021823-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>It all feels so harmless. Who isn&#8217;t even alittle curious which celebrity is their look-a-like or what &#8217;80s song best matches their personality? While some of these fun little quizzes and facial recognition-type games that pop up on social media are advertiser-generated and harmless, others have been carefully designed to steal your data.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/stlouis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Business Bureau </a>(BBB) consumers need to beware with the IQ tests, quizzes that require you to trade information. Depending on the goal of the scam, one click could result in a new slew of email or text spam, malicious data mining, or even a monthly charge on your phone bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the spammy quizzes, scammers also use click bait, that are headlines designed to get your click and your data. Such headlines often promise juicy info on celebrities and may even legitimate human interest stories that claim, &#8220;and you won&#8217;t believe what happened next.&#8221; While some of those headlines are authored by reputable companies simply trying to sell products and compete for clicks, others are data traps that chip away at your privacy.</p>
<p>The best defense against click bait is knowledge. Similar to the plague of fake news circulating online, click bait is getting more sophisticated and deceptive in appearance, which means that users must be even more sophisticated in understanding how to sidestep these digital traps.</p>
<h2><strong>5 Tips to Help You Tame Your Clicks</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just say no, help others do the same. </strong>Scammers understand human digital behavior and design quizzes they know will get a lot of shares. &#8220;Fun&#8221; and &#8220;wow!&#8221; easily goes viral. Refuse to pass on the information and when you see it, call it out like <a href="http://www.fightidentitytheft.com/blog/facebook-quizzes-sharing-your-private-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogger David Neilsen</a> did (right). A scammers goal is access to your data and access to your social pages, which gives them access to your <em>friend&#8217;s data</em>. If you want to find out which Harry Potter character you are most like, just know you will pay with your privacy — so just practice saying no.</li>
<li><strong>Vet your friends.</strong> Gone are the days of hundreds of thousands of &#8220;friends and followers&#8221; to affirm our social worth. With every unknown friend you let into your digital circle, you increase your chances of losing more privacy. Why take the risk? Also, take a closer look at who is sharing a contest, quiz, or game. A known friend may have been hacked. Go through their feed to see if there&#8217;s anything askew with the account.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of click jacking.</strong> This malicious technique tricks a web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, which could result in revealing confidential information or a scammer taking control of their computer.</li>
<li><strong>Be aware of &#8216;Like Farming&#8217; scams.</strong> Quizzes can be part of a scam called &#8220;Like Farming.&#8221; In this scenario, scammers create a piece of legitimate content, then swap it out for something else less desirable once the post has gone viral.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your settings.</strong> Since these quizzes mainly show up on Facebook, start adjusting your settings there. You will be prompted from your Settings to select/deselect the level of permissions that exist. This is one easy way to stop the madness. Another way is to go to the actual post/quiz and click on the downward facing arrow to the top right of the post. Tell Facebook to block these types of ads or posts, or if you are sure it&#8217;s a scam, report the post.</li>
<li><strong>Value your online time. </strong>Click bait is an epic waste of time. When a headline or quiz teases users to click without giving much information about will follow, those posts get a lot more clicks, which moves them up the Facebook food chain. Keep in mind click bait is a trap that A) tricks you B) wastes valuable time and C) edges out content from your friends and Facebook pages that you actually want to see.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our digital landscape is peppered with fake news and click bait, which makes it difficult to build trust with individuals and brands who have legitimate messages and products to share. As you become savvy to the kinds of data scams, your discernment and ability to hold onto your clicks will become second nature. Continue to have fun, learn, connect, but guard your heart with every click. Be sure to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep yor devices protected</a> while you do!</p>

Thanks to the aid of popular AI tools like ChatGPT, scammers can potentially generate anything from seemingly innocent intro chats to full-blown love letters in seconds, all ready to dupe their victims on demand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Tactics like these are typical of “catfishing” in dating and romance scams, where the scammer creates a phony online persona and uses it to lure their victim into a relationship for financial gain. Think of it as a bait-and-hook approach, where the promise of love is the bait, and theft is the hook.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And as explained above, baiting that hook just got far easier with AI. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Sound farfetched? After all, who would fall for such a thing? It turns out that a sophisticated AI chatbot can sound an awful lot like a real person seeking romance.

<p><span data-contrast="none">One-third of the people (33%) thought that a person wrote this letter, 31% said an AI wrote it, and 36% said they couldn’t tell one way or another. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What did you think? If you said that a person wrote the letter, you got hoodwinked. An AI wrote it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The implications are concerning. Put plainly, scammers can turn on the charm practically at will with AI, generating high volumes of romance-laden content for potentially high volumes of victims. And as our research indicates, plenty of people are ready to soak it up.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Of course, the true telltale sign of an online dating or romance scam is when the scammer asks for money. The scammer includes a little story with that request too, usually revolving around some sort of hardship. They may say they need to pay for travel or medical expenses, a visa or other travel documents, or even customs fees to retrieve an item that they say is stuck in the mail. There’s always some kind of twist or intriguing complication that seems just reasonable enough such that the victim falls for it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Scammers will often favor payment via wire transfers, gift cards, and reloadable debit cards, because they’re like cash in many regards—once you fork over that money, it’s as good as gone. These forms of payment offer few protections in the event of scam, theft, or loss, unlike a credit card charge that you can contest or cancel with the credit card company. Unsurprisingly, scammers have also added cryptocurrency to that list because it’s notoriously difficult to trace and recover. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

In fact, in Q3 of 2022 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.5 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Who else will pen a love letter with AI this Valentine’s Day?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Worldwide, we found that 30% of men (and 26% of all adults) said they plan to use artificial intelligence tools to put their feelings into words. Yet, there’s a flipside. We also found that 49% of respondents said they’d be offended if they found out the note they received had been produced by a machine. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So why are people turning to AI? The most popular reason given for using AI as a ghostwriter was that it would make the sender feel more confident (27%), while others cited lack of time (21%) or lack of inspiration (also 21%), while 10% said it would just be quicker and easier and that they didn’t think they’d get found out.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s also worth noting that true romance seekers have called upon AI to kick off chats in dating apps, which might take the form of an ice-breaking joke or wistful comment. Likewise, AI-enabled apps have started cropping up in app stores, which can coach you through a conversation based on contextual cues like asking someone out or rescheduling a date. Some can even create AI-generated art on demand to share a feeling through an image. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It may be better than opening a conversation with an otherwise dull “hey,” yet as our research shows, there are risks involved if people lean on it too heavily—and prove to be quite a different person when they start talking on their own.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">AI is only as good or bad as the way people use it</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s important to remember that an AI chatbot like ChatGPT is a tool. It’s not inherently good or bad. It’s all in the hands of the user and how they choose to apply it. And in the case of scammers, AI chatbots have the potential to do a lot of harm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, you can protect yourself. In fact, you can still spot online dating and romance scams in much the same way as before. They still follow certain rules and share the same signs. If anything, the one thing that has changed is this: reading messages today calls for extra scrutiny. It will take a sharp eye to tell what’s real and what’s fake. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As our research showed, online dating and romance scams begin and end with you. Thinking back to what we learned as children about “stranger danger” goes a long way here. Be suspicious and, better yet, don’t engage. Go about your way. And if you do find yourself chatting with someone who requests money or personal information, end it. Painful as the decision may be, it’s the right decision. No true friend or partner, one you’ve never seen or met, would rightfully ask that of you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Romance scams have been breaking hearts and emptying bank accounts since the advent of online dating in the 1990s. In 2021 alone, the FTC received 56,000 reports of romance scams and losses totaling $547 million. Compared to just four years earlier, total losses increased by 500%.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency romance scams are a relatively new evolution of the scheme. Here’s what you should know and signs that may indicate you’re communicating with a manipulative crypto thief.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2>What Is a Cryptocurrency Romance Scam?</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A cryptocurrency romance scam is an online scheme where a cybercriminal forges romantic relationships through online platforms to trick people into handing over crypto assets. Conversations may begin on social media platforms or dating apps. After a few days, weeks, or – if the criminal is patient – months of communicating, the scammer uses their manufactured romantic bond to guilt their target into sending cryptocurrency. The criminal will often tug on heartstrings with made-up sad stories to explain what they’ll use the money for. They may ask for a few hundred to thousands of dollars’ worth of crypto. Once they’ve received payment, they may continue the charade of a relationship to attempt to weasel more money, or they may “end the relationship” and disappear to try their luck with someone else.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Artificial intelligence text generators like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/chatgpt-a-scammers-newest-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ChatGPT</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> make juggling multiple love scams at once easier and quicker for scammers. Instead of using their brain to think up “heartfelt” proclamations of love, they can ask an AI program to do the work for them. And AI-written love letters are convincing! In </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/reports-and-guides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s Modern Love Report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, 69% of global respondents were unable to tell if a love note was written by a human or a machine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In crypto romance plots specifically, the criminal will ask for payment in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. In general, you should be skeptical of any person or organization that asks for payment in crypto. Cryptocurrency is famously untraceable, meaning that once it hits someone else’s crypto wallet, there’s no way to get it back or ascertain the real identity of the account holder. Unlike a bank account that a real person with a valid Social Security Number must open, crypto does not have such requirements. The anonymity is what makes crypto the preferred payment type of nefarious characters. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2>How to Identify a Crypto Scam</h2>
<p>There are three tell-tale signs of an online crypto dating scam. If you encounter any of these scenarios, begin to ask more probing questions. If you’re unsatisfied with the answers or the person you’re communicating with becomes defensive, you may want to consider blocking this person on your device and removing them from your life.</p>
<h3>1. A fast-moving relationship.</h3>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0">The getting-to-know-you phase of any new relationship is</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0"> exciting and interesting</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0">.

If someone you’ve never met in person tells you they love you after just a few conversations, </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0">be wary of their compliments.</span> <span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193446993 BCX0">Love-at-first-direct-message isn’t real.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW193446993 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3>2. Refusal to meet in person or over video.</h3>
<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">Refus</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">ing or constantly postponing</span> <span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">in-person meetings</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> is a major red flag.</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">In 39% of catfishing </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">incidents</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">, turning down in-person meetups was the ultimate sign that alerted </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">people</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> to </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">the</span> <span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">catfish</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">, according to the Modern Love Report</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">.</span> <span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">C</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">atfish – or someone using fake photos and/or backstor</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">ies</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> to deceive others online</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> – often make</span> <span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">all kinds of excuses to avoid showing their face</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> or even </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">talk</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> on the phone</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0">.

When two people have a deep connection based on genuine love, they’ll make the necessary compromises to</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW131781850 BCX0"> show their real face.</span></p>
<h3>3. Fixation on crypto assets and the future.</h3>
<p>Romance scammers may constantly lament their financial woes and say how they wished money wasn’t a problem. To gain sympathy, they may claim to have a sick family member or pet who needs expensive medical treatment. At this point, the scammer will hope that the target offers to send money, or the scammer may sheepishly request money outright. To keep targets from growing suspicious or resentful, the scammer is often overly thankful and promises to never ask for money again; however, they always do. Never share your <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-a-crypto-wallet-and-how-to-keep-your-wallet-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto wallet private key</a> with anyone, and immediately be on alert if someone you met online and have never met in person asks for payment in crypto.</p>
<h2>Protect Your Assets, Identity, and Heart</h2>
<p>Everyone who’s ever endured a breakup hates this saying for its maddening simplicity, but its message is true: There are other fish in the sea. Literally billions. Everyone deserves a partner who respects their time and needs. If the person on the other side of the screen is taking more than they’re giving, it’s time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>A partner who will never let you down is <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee+ Ultimate</a>. This all-in-one device, privacy, and identity protection service lets you live your best online life confidently.

<p>So, this Valentine’s Day, slow down and evaluate each new match for the robustness of their messages, not their “photo,” “job,” or “grand future plans.” Be careful in that harsh dating world and never settle for mediocre. The perfect person is out there somewhere!</p>

That&#8217;s why it can be tempting to connect to free, public Wi-Fi networks, but you should know that these networks could open you up to some serious risks.</p>
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks often lack a security measure called encryption, which scrambles the information sent from your computer or device to the router so strangers cannot read it. Without this security measure in place, the information you send over these networks can potentially be intercepted by cybercrooks.</p>
<p>This information could include your banking and social media passwords, as well as your identity information. A nosy cybercriminal could also potentially snoop on you by watching which websites you visit, and what you type into web forms.</p>
<p>In fact, it is so easy to steal your information over unsecured networks cybercrooks sometimes set up malicious Wi-Fi hotspots in high-traffic areas, like airports, with the intention of grabbing users’ information.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why if you have to connect when you’re away, you should only use secure and well-advertised Wi-Fi networks. You can usually tell if they use encryption because they require a password to join.</p>
<p>If you have to do something sensitive online, like check your bank account balance or make a purchase, try to stick to webpages that start with “HTTPS” rather than just “HTTP”. The “S” stands for secure and indicates that the site uses encryption to protect your data. You can also look for a green lock icon at the beginning of the browser address, which indicates that the website connection is secure.</p>
<p>If you are on your mobile phone, you can skip the Wi-Fi network altogether and connect using the cellular network. It is somewhat more secure since it’s harder for cybercrooks to sniff out your individual data from others on the network.</p>
<p>If you travel a lot, consider investing in a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a>, which is a piece of software that allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. Anyone potentially trying to snoop on you will only see that you are connected to the VPN, and not what you are doing.</p>
<p>Of course, the most important thing is to remember that using public Wi-Fi is always risky, and requires some extra steps to protect your data.</p>
<h2><strong>Here are some more tips to help keep you safe:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Think twice before connecting to any public Wi-Fi network, especially if it does not require a password to join.</li>
<li>Avoid using free, public computers. Cybercriminals sometimes place compromised computers in legitimate Wi-Fi hotspots with the intention of spreading malware or stealing your data.</li>
<li>Try to save sensitive transactions, like banking and online shopping, for your secure home or work networks.</li>
<li>If you do use a public network, stick to sites that begin with “HTTPS” so you know they are secure. The HTTPS Everywhere browser extension can direct you to encrypted pages when available. Also, look for the green lock icon in the browser’s address bar.</li>
<li>When using your laptop, make sure to turn off “sharing” of your folders and devices so no one else on the network can access them. A quick web search can tell you how to do this on your operating system.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comprehensive security software</a> and keep it up-to-date. If your software includes a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firewall</a>, make sure to enable it.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Safer Internet Day</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> celebrates its 20</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none"> year on February 7</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none"> and focuses on ways we can all protect, empower, and respect all children </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">when they go online</span></a><span data-contrast="none">—and gives us an opportunity to reflect on what that really means.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Consider that for some time now, children have found themselves born into an online world. As soon as they can pick up a toy, they can pick up a phone or tablet too. And they often do, given that they’re growing up in homes where one is practically always in reach. With that, their online life begins.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Learning how to live life online is simply another part of growing up nowadays. And that’s where we as parents play a significant role. Just as in every other aspect of life, they look to us for guidance, encouragement, and new things to see and do online. Safely, too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Children look to their parents and families when it comes to staying safe online.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Children have said as much. In our recent global report entitled “</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-connected-family-study-2022-global.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Life Behind the Screens of Parents, Tweens, and Teens</span></a><span data-contrast="none">,” we asked who is best suited to teach them about being safe online. Children said their parents are the clear winners. Nearly three-quarters of children pointed to parents, almost twice more than teachers at school (39%) and more than twice over for online resources (34%). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, while parents agreed with this, it appears they didn’t always follow through. For starters, parents reported using basic protection on their own computers at a relatively low rate. Even the simplest of security steps scored relatively low despite how relatively easy they are to take. That included using antivirus software (68%), protecting the computer with a password (58%), or sticking to reputable online stores when shopping (50%). These figures dropped yet lower when asked if they took the same precautions for their children on their computers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For example, only 57% of parents said they installed antivirus on their child’s computer and only 44% have their child password or passcode protect their computer, as illustrated by the drops in the chart below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-163800" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/security-implications.png" alt="" width="585" height="212" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/security-implications.png 585w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/security-implications-300x109.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/security-implications-205x74.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This trend extends to smartphones as well. While 56% of parents said that they protect their smartphone with a password or passcode, only 42% said they do the same for their child’s smartphone—a 14% difference. Again, considering how easy it is to create a password or passcode for a phone, and how much of our online lives course through those devices, that figure would ideally come in at 100%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, many parents protect their children even less than they protect themselves. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Children group up quickly online—quicker than you might think</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Everyone loves their smartphone. Children particularly so. While parents placed their smartphone as their top device at 59%, followed by their computer or laptop at 42%, tweens and teens put their smartphone at the top of the at a decisive 74%. Second was their gaming console at 68%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Unsurprisingly, that love for the smartphone pushes children’s internet usage quickly to an adult level at an early age, marking a sort of early mobile maturity where they are exposed to the broader internet full of apps, chats, entertainment, and social media—along with their benefits and risks nearly right away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-163786" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smartphone-usage.png" alt="" width="624" height="237" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smartphone-usage.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smartphone-usage-300x114.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smartphone-usage-205x78.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Taken with the low level of security measures parents place on their children’s phones, we can see how children are going online with a device that’s largely unprotected—in part because their parents leave their smartphones largely unprotected as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Staying safer online takes more than a secure device.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Beyond devices, parents have other concerns about their children as they increasingly spend more time online, particularly as they get older. Some of the top ones include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Increasingly, staying safe online involve more than protecting devices—it revolves around protecting the people who use them. Topics like the ones above are prime examples. They’re about people, not devices.

<p><span data-contrast="none">And that can feel a bit overwhelming to a parent. Luckily, as with other aspects of parenting, you don’t have to think about all these topics all at once.

<p><span data-contrast="none">It starts with asking a few questions. What might be on the horizon for our children as they go online over the next few weeks and months? How can you support them?

Online scammers are ramping up for the big game with all types of schemes designed to rip you off and steal your personal info—but you have several ways you can beat them at their game. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Like shopping holidays, tax season, and even back-to-school time, scammers take advantage of annual events that get people searching for deals and information online. You can include big games and tournaments in that list too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Specific to this big game, you can count on several types of scams to rear their heads this time of year—ticket scams, merchandise scams, betting scams, and phony sweepstakes as well. They’re all in the mix, and they’re all avoidable. Here, we’ll break them down.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Keep an eye out for ticket scams.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As of two weeks out, tickets for the big game on the official ticketing website were going for $6,000 or so, and that was for the so-called “cheap seats.” Premium seats in the lower bowl 50-yard line, sold by verified resellers, were listed at $20,000 a pop or higher. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While the game tickets are now 100% mobile, that hasn’t prevented scammers from trying to pass off phony tickets as the real deal. They’ll hawk those counterfeits in plenty of places online, sometimes in sites like your friendly neighborhood Craigslist. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So if you’re in the market for tickets, there are certainly a few things to look out for:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

These payment methods work like cash, meaning that if you pay a scammer with them, your money is good as gone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Look out for online merch scams.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you plan on enjoying the game closer to home, you may be in the market for some merch—a hat, a jersey, a tee, or maybe some new mugs for entertaining when you host the game at your place. With all the hype around the game, out will come scammers who set up bogus online stores. They’ll advertise items for sale but won’t deliver—leaving you a few dollars lighter and the scammers with your payment information, which they can use on their own for identity fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can shop safely with a few straightforward steps:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Stick with known, legitimate retailers online for your merch.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This is a great one to start with. Directly typing in the correct address for reputable online stores and retailers is a prime way to avoid scammers online. In the case of retailers that you don’t know much about, </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/14147-bbb-tip-black-friday#:~:text=Do%20your%20research.%C2%A0Read%20product%20reviews%20on%20extremely%20discounted%20items.%20It%20could%20be%20a%20cheaper%20model%20or%20brand%20advertised%2C%20and%20not%20what%20was%20expected.%20Check%20BBB.org%27s%20business%20profiles%20of%20the%20stores%20and%20read%20what%20other%20customers%20have%20experienced." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) asks shoppers to do their research and make sure that retailer has a good reputation</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. The BBB makes that easier with </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a listing of retailers you can search</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> simply by typing in their name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you feel like doing extra sleuthing, look up the address of the website and see when it was launched. A visit to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) at </span><a href="http://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ICANN.org</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> gives you the option to search a web address and see when it was launched, along with other information about who registered it. While a recently launched site is not an indicator of a scam site alone, sites with limited track records may give you pause if you want to shop there—particularly if there’s a chance it was just propped up by a scammer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">&lt;h3&gt;Look for the lock icon in your browser when you shop.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Secure websites begin their address with “https,” not just “http.” That extra “s” in stands for “secure,” which means that it uses a secure protocol for transmitting sensitive info like passwords, credit card numbers, and the like over the internet. It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use a secure payment method other than your debit card.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Credit cards are a good way to go. One reason why is the Fair Credit Billing Act, which offers protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards by giving you the right to dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly. Your credit card companies may have their own policies that improve upon the Fair Credit Billing Act as well. Debit cards don’t get the same protection under the Act. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Get online protection.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software will defend</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> against the latest virus, malware, spyware, and ransomware attacks plus further protect your privacy and identity. In addition to this, it can also provide strong password protection by generating and automatically storing complex passwords to keep your credentials safer from hackers and crooks who may try to force their way into your accounts. And, specific to the scams floating around this time of year, online protection can help prevent you from clicking links to known or suspected malicious sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s hard to watch sports these days without odds and stat lines popping up onto the screen, along with a fair share of ads that promote online betting.

Yet it shouldn’t come as a surprise that scam betting sites have cropped up. According to the Better Business Bureau (BBB), they’ve received plenty of complaints. “You place a bet, and, at first, everything seems normal. But as soon as you try to cash out your winnings, you find you can’t withdraw a cent.

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Watch out for phony sweepstakes and prizes too.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As it is every year, you’ll see kinds of sweepstakes and giveaways leading up to the game, plenty of them legitimate. Yet as they do, scammers will try and blend in by rolling out their own bogus promotions. Their aim: to part you from your cash or even your personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A quick way to sniff out these scams is to take a close look at the promotion. For example, if it asks you to provide your bank information to send you your prize money, count on it being a scam. Likewise, if the promotion asks you to pay to claim a prize in some form or other, it’s also likely someone’s trying to scam you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, steer clear of promotions that ask something for something in return, particularly if it’s your money or personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As it is of late, all kinds of scams will try to glom onto the big game this year. And some of the best advice for avoiding them is not to give in to the hype. Scammers prey on scarcity, a sense of urgency, and keyed-up emotions in general. Their hope is that these things may make you less critical and more likely to overlook things that would otherwise seem sketchy or too good to be true. Staying focused as you shop, place a wager, or otherwise look to round out your enjoyment of the big game is some of your absolute best defense against scammers right now, and any time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

But online protection looks a little different for everyone, because everyone goes online a little differently.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">we’re introducing our McAfee+ Family plans</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> online protection that protects each family member with their own login, all based on their online risks and activities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like so many things in family life, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t always do the trick. For example, a movie night with an award-winning film that’s “R” rating may be fine for mom and dad but not for the kids. And music? CoComelon works great for playdates, but not for dinner dates. Yet everyone in the family wants the same thing. To enjoy themselves. It just looks different from person to person. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The same goes for online protection. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all need protection when we go online. Yet different family members may need different kinds of protection depending on their age, interests, and what they do online. So, staying safer calls for a personalized approach, one that’s tailored to the things they do online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The larger idea that inspired our family plans is this—you should have absolute confidence that everyone you care about has the protection they need. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That can get a little tricky when you think it through.

<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Editor’s Note: We often speak of online scams in our blogs, ones that cost victims hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This account puts a face on one of those scams—along with the personal, financial, and emotional pain that they can leave in their wake. This is the story of “Meredith,” whose aunt “Leslie” fell victim to an emerging form on online elder fraud. Our thanks to James for bringing it forward and to “Meredith’s” family for sharing it, all so others can prevent such scams from happening to them.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Embarrassing. Simply embarrassing.” She shook her head. “It’s too raw. I can’t talk about it right now. I need time.”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Her aunt had been scammed. To the tune of $100,000 dollars. My colleague—we both work in the security industry—felt a peculiar sense of loss.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I work in this industry. I thought I’d done everything right. I’ve passed on enough warnings to my family and friends to ensure they’d avoid the fate of the scammed.  Simply because I’m in this industry does not imply my circle is always aware of all the threats to them, even if I do my best to teach them.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“My mental state, recently, borders on shame; this feeling, you know? How could someone working in my industry have something like this happen to a family member?” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I told her many people working in other industries cannot control what happens to people in their families </span><span data-contrast="auto">even if people in that industry had knowledge that could have helped them or otherwise avoided a problem altogether.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I know, but this simply should never have happened! My aunt is one of the smartest, most conscientious people I know, and she fell for this. It’s crazy and I can’t wrap my head around it.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My colleague, let’s call her Meredith (not her real name as she’s a bit ashamed to know this happened to a family member), told me the beginnings.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s call her aunt Leslie.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Her story unfolds, the overall picture a pastiche of millions of people in the United States today. Her aunt is retired, bored, lonely, and isolated. She feels adrift without something to occupy her time; she was looking for companionship, connections, someone (anyone) to talk to. Her feelings intensified during the pandemic. She morphed into perfect prey for scammers of what is now known as the “Pig Butchering Scam.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The term “Pig Butchering” has a visceral and raw feel to it, which falls right in line with how brutal this scam can be. It’s a long con game, where the scammer befriends the victim and encourages them to make small investments through the scammer, which get bigger and bigger over time. The scammer builds trust early with what appear to be small investment wins. None of it is legit. The money goes right into the scammer’s pocket, even as the scammer shows the victim phony financial statements and dashboards to show off the bogus returns. Confidence grows. The scammer wrings even larger sums out of the victim. And then disappears. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It was a targeted attack that started innocuously enough with a “fake wrong number”. An SMS arrives. A text conversation starts. The scammer then apologizes but tells Leslie someone gave them the number to initiate the text.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The scammer then uses emotional and psychological techniques to keep Leslie hooked.  “How are you, are you having a nice day?” Leslie, being bored and interested, engages willingly.    </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The scammer asks to talk directly, not via text: and a phone conversation ensues.  The scammer proceeds to describe—in very soothing detail—what they are doing, helping people, like Leslie, invest their “hard-earned money” into something that will make them more money, to help them out in retirement.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, it is too good to be true. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The craziest part of all of this is my aunt refuses—to this day—to believe she’s been scammed!”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">She still thinks this scammer is a “friend” even though the entire family is up in arms over this, all of whom beg her aunt to “open her eyes.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“My aunt still thinks she’d going to see that money again, or even make some money, which is crazy. The scammers are so good at emotional intelligence; really leveraging heartstrings and psychological makeup of the forlorn in society. My aunt finally agreed to stop sending more money to the scammers, but only after the entire family threatened to cut her off from the rest of the family. It took a lot to get her to stop trusting the scammers.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Meredith feels this is doubly sad as the aunt in question is not someone they’d ever imagine would in this predicament. She was always the upright one, always the diligent and hardworking and the best with money. She is smart and savvy and we could never imagine her to be taken by these people and taken so easily. It boggles the mind.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">She did start to change in the last few years. And the pandemic created a weird situation. Retirement, loneliness from loss of a partner, and the added burden of the pandemic created a perfect storm for her to open herself up to someone willingly, simply for the sake of connection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“No one deserves this. It has rocked my family to the core. It is not only about the money, but we’ve found family bonds stretched. She believes these random people, these scammers, more than she believes her own family. Have we been neglectful of our aunt? Does she no longer put her faith in people she knows, rather gives money to complete strangers?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Being a security professional does not provide magical protection. We are more aware of scams and scammers, and how they work, and what to look for, and we try to do all we can to keep our family aware of scams out there in the big wide world, but we are human. We fall short.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Diligence is action. Awareness is action. Education is action.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We need to be better, all of us, at socializing risky things. We need to consistently educate our family and friends to protect themselves, not only via security software (which everyone should have as default) but by providing tips and tricks and warnings for things we all need to be on the lookout. This is not a one-time thing. The cliché holds true: “If you see something say something.” Repetition helps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In today’s world, the need for protecting people’s security, identity, and privacy is critical to keeping them safe. Scammers long stopped focusing on attacking only your computer. Now focus more than ever on YOU: your identity, your privacy, your trust. If they get you there, they soon get your money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As for contributing factors to scammers success with their victims, such as loneliness, isolation, and boredom, they all have remedies.  Make connections with your loved ones, especially those easily tagged as vulnerable, those you feel might be at risk. Reach out. It may be hard sometimes due to distance and other factors but make it a point to connect. There is a reason these scammers are succeeding. They are stepping into roles of companions to people who are desperate for connection.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most people are greatly saddened at seeing other people being “taken.” Let’s work together to help stop the scammers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

And that data tells a story. The story of you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The websites, apps, and services you use throughout the day all collect data. They may collect data about your behaviors, interests, and purchases—along with what you’re doing, for how long, and where, largely without your knowledge. They may also collect personal information, information you provide, such as health records, your Social Security Number, banking info, your driver’s license number, and more. This can include further health data, such as the kind that gets tracked from a smart watch or wearable device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“So what?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I’ve heard plenty of people say exactly that about data collection. And plenty of others simply resign themselves to the reality of data collection. “What’s out there is already out there.” They feel like there’s not much they can do about it. If anything at all. And does it really matter?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It absolutely matters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That is, it matters if you hate spam calls and texts. If you’re worried about identity theft. If you’re worried that practically anyone can purchase a detailed picture of your personal information from an online data broker and use it as they like.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Indeed, your data tells the story of you. And plenty of others are interested in your story. Businesses and advertisers for one, so they can market to the most targeted of your needs and interests. Yet also hackers, scammers, spammers, and thieves—and in extreme cases, stalkers as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While it’s true that you cannot control how each byte of data about you and your family is shared and processed, you’re not helpless! In many cases, you can control how you share your data by taking a few steps. Your data is precious, and you deserve to be selective about who you share it with.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s the reason you’ve seen McAfee roll out so many protections for your privacy and identity, with several more to come. While there are so many tools for data collection today, so are the tools for you to take control.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Looking at our own McAfee+ online protection plans, they offer you identity theft and fraud protections such as Personal Data Cleanup, identity monitoring, along with credit monitoring, a VPN that can help keep your online activity remain more private, $1M in identity theft coverage and support from an identity restoration specialist … the list goes on. These are tools everyone can benefit from in the face of the current threats out there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The evolution of McAfee+ reflects the nature of online threats today. Increasingly, the target is you—your privacy, your identity, and all the things that they unlock. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Three things you can do right now that help make you more private online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Use a complete security platform that includes a VPN, password manager, and web protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another simple yet powerful step is to protect your devices with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This will help defend you against the latest virus, malware, spyware, and ransomware attacks plus further shield your privacy and minimize web tracking (think advertisers) with a VPN. In addition to this, it will also create and store strong, unique passwords, plus offer web protection that can help steer you clear of sketchy websites that may try to steal your data.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Review your privacy settings for the devices, platforms, and apps you use</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Start with the devices and apps you use most. Different devices and apps will have their own privacy settings, so give them a look and see what your options are. You may be surprised to find how you can limit which information advertisers can use to serve up ads to you. You may find that some apps have GPS tracking turned on, even though they don’t need it to function. All of this adds up to data that companies may collect, share, or resell—depending on their privacy policy. Again, start with the devices and apps you use most then expand from there. It’s also a good opportunity to delete apps you don’t use anymore—along with the data associated with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) Clean up the personal data posted about you online </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One major privacy leak comes at the hands of online data brokers, companies that collect and resell volumes of exacting personal information about millions of people. In fact, they make up a multi-billion-dollar industry that spans worldwide. Additionally, there are so-called “White Pages” and “people finder” sites that post information like names, addresses, and other public records that anyone can access. With all this information collected in a central location that’s easily searched and accessed, these sites can be an ideal resource for hackers, spammers, and thieves. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s Personal Data Cleanup can help you take control</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. It scans high-risk data broker sites and lets you know which ones are selling your data, and depending on your McAfee+ plan, it can remove it for you too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Yes, you can take control of your privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet you can take even more control of your privacy. As part of our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/reports-and-guides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Safety Series</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, we have </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/guides/gd-digital-privacy-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">an entire guide dedicated to the topic of online privacy, the McAfee Digital Privacy Guide.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> It shows you ways that you can take control of your digital privacy, insight into what information you may be creating, and how you may be passing it along—whether you know it or not.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, your privacy is your own.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The best way to avoid being fooled by AI-generated text is by being on high alert and scrutinizing any texts, emails, or direct messages you receive from strangers. There are a few tell-tale signs of an AI-written message. For example, AI often uses short sentences and reuses the same words. Additionally, AI may create content that says a lot without saying much at all. Because AI can’t form opinions, their messages may sound substance-less. In the case of romance scams, if the person you’re communicating with refuses to meet in person or chat over video, consider cutting ties. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>The popularity of AI-based mobile applications that can create artistic images based on pictures, such as the “Magic Avatars” from Lensa, and the OpenAI service DALL-E 2 that generates them from text, have increased the mainstream interest of these tools. Users should be aware of those seeking to take advantage to distribute Potential Unwanted Programs (PUPs) or malware, such as through deceptive applications that promise the same or similar advanced features but are just basic image editors or otherwise repackaged apps that can drain your data plan and battery life with Clicker and HiddenAds behaviors, subscribe you to expensive services that provide little or no value over alternatives  (Fleeceware), or even <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/instagram-credentials-stealers-free-followers-or-free-likes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steal your social media account</a> credentials (FaceStealer).</p>

<p>Dozens of apps surface daily claiming to offer AI image creation. Some of them might be legitimate or based on open-source projects such as Stable Diffusion, but in the search for a free application that produces quality results, users might try new apps that could compromise their privacy, user experience, wallet and/or security.</p>
<p>The McAfee Mobile Research Team recently discovered a series of repackaged image editors on the Google Play app store which presented concerning behaviors.  McAfee Mobile Security products help protect against such apps, including those classified as Android/FakeApp, Android/FaceStealer, Android/PUP.Repacked and Android/PUP.GenericAdware.</p>
<p>McAfee, a member of the <a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Defense Alliance</a> focused on protecting users by preventing threats from reaching their devices and improving app quality across the ecosystem, reported the discovered apps to Google, which took prompt action and the apps are no longer available on Google Play.</p>
<p>We now discuss various types of privacy and/or security risks associated with the types of apps recently removed from the app store.</p>

<h2>Fleeceware</h2>
<p>Fleeceware refers to mobile apps that use various tactics to enroll users into subscriptions with high fees, typically after a free trial period, and often with little or no value to the subscriber beyond cheaper or free alternatives. If the user does not take care to cancel their subscription, they continue to be charged even after deleting the app.</p>
<p>“Toonify Me”, which is no longer available on the Play Store, cost $49.99 per week after 3 days – almost $2,600 per year – for what <span class="TextRun SCXW39860132 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart CommentHighlightPipeRest CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">featured</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0"> AI-generated illustrations </span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">in the app description</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">,</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0"> but</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0"> was</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0"> a</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">nother</span> <span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">repackaged</span> <span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">version of the same image </span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">editor</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0"> functionality </span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">found within </span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">“NewProfilePicture” and “Pista – Cartoon Photo Effect”</span><span class="NormalTextRun CommentHighlightPipeRest SCXW39860132 BCX0">.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW39860132 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p>In this case, the “Toonify Me” app did not allow feature access without enrolling in the subscription, and the “CONTINUE” button which initiated the subscription was the only option to tap in the app once it was launched.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When new types of apps become popular and new ones appear on the market to offer similar features, users should act with caution to avoid becoming victim to those wanting to exploit public interest.</p>
<p>When installing an app that causes you doubt, make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the pricing and other terms carefully</li>
<li>Check those permissions requested are reasonable with the purpose of the app</li>
<li>Look for consistently bad reviews describing unexpected or unwanted app behavior</li>
<li>Verify if the developer has other apps available and their reviews</li>
<li>Consider skipping the app download if you aren’t convinced of its safety</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if an app is legitimate, we also encourage users to look closely before installation at any available privacy policy to understand how personal data will be treated.  Your face is a biometric identifier that’s not easy to change, and multiple pictures might be needed (and stored) to create your model.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence tools will continue to amaze us with their capabilities and probably will become more accessible and safer to use over time.  For now, keep in mind that AI technology is still limited and experimental, and can be expensive to use – always consider any hidden costs.  AI also will bring more challenges as we discussed on the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/security-news/mcafee-2023-threat-predictions-evolution-and-exploitation/">2023 McAfee Threat Prediction</a> blog.</p>
<h2>IDENTIFIED APPS</h2>
<p>The following table lists the application package name, hash sum SHA256, the minimum number of installations on Google Play, and the type of detected threat. These apps were removed from Google Play, but some may remain available elsewhere.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some possible signs of hacking software on your Mac include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Maybe you’ve seen some of the signs we mentioned earlier. Is your device operating slower, are web pages and apps harder to load, or does your battery never seem to keep a charge? These are all signs that you could have malware running in the background, zapping your device’s resources.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like the performance issues above, malware or mining apps running in the background can burn extra computing power (and data). Aside from sapping performance, malware and mining apps can cause your computer to run hot or even overheat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you find apps you haven’t downloaded, along with messages and emails that you didn’t send, that’s a red flag.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malware can also be behind spammy pop-ups, changes to your home screen, or bookmarks to suspicious websites.

Antivirus protects your devices, whereas identity and privacy protection looks after you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Online threats have evolved, so has online protection software. While malware and viruses will always be a threat and antivirus will always be needed to counter that threat, today’s hackers, scammers, and thieves increasingly target you. They’re after your personal info, online banking accounts, financial info, and even your social media accounts, so that they can commit identity theft and fraud in your name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

Personal data from public sources that can include records about you that involve bankruptcies, real estate sales, and birth records. It’s also gathered from private sources, like the health and wellness apps you use, the shopping record on your supermarket discount card, who you chat with in messaging apps, and so on. This information can end up with data brokers who’ll sell it to anyone, like background checkers, advertisers, private investigators, and practically anyone who wants to know more, lots more, about you. And that includes hackers, scammers, and thieves. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

While Macs have strong protections built into them, they may not offer the full breadth of protection you want, particularly in terms of online identity theft and the ability to protect you from the latest malware threats.

And that’s truer today when it comes to life online as cybercriminals use the internet to steal financial or personal data for their personal gain—otherwise known as identity theft. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This is a criminal act and can affect your credit score in a negative way and cost money to fix. It can also affect employment opportunities since some employers conduct a credit check on top of drug testing and a criminal history check. Identity theft victims may even experience an impact to their mental health as they work to resolve their case.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This could include private details like your birth date, bank account information, Social Security number, home address, and more. With data like this, an individual can adopt your identity (or even create a fake identity using pieces of your personal profile) and apply for loans, credit cards, debit cards, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You don’t have to be kept in the dark, though. The good news is that being able to recognize the signs of identity theft means you can act quickly to intervene and minimize any effects in case it happens to you. You can also protect yourself by using preventive measures and engaging in smart online behavior. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Steps to take if you think your identity has been stolen</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:210,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There are several signs that your identity has been stolen, from a change in your credit score to receiving unfamiliar bills and debt collectors calling about unfamiliar new accounts. It may be an unusual charge on one of your cards, however small. Or </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you may use a credit monitoring service like ours and receive an alert of suspicious activity</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. However it comes to your attention, you can act fast to minimize what happens.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p aria-level="3"><span data-contrast="none">File a police report</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:210,&quot;335559740&quot;:450}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Start by contacting law enforcement to file a report. Your local police department can issue a formal report, which you may need to get your bank or other financial institution to reverse fraudulent charges. An official report assures the bank that you have been affected by identity fraud and it’s not a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Before going to the police, gather all the relevant information about what happened. This could include the dates and times of fraudulent activity and any account numbers affected. Bringing copies of your bank statements can be useful. Also, make note of any suspicious activity that could be related. For example, was your debit card recently lost or your email hacked? The police will want to know.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p aria-level="3"><span data-contrast="none">Notify the company where the fraud occurred</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:210,&quot;335559740&quot;:450}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You should also notify any businesses linked to your identity theft case. Depending on the type of identity theft, this could include banks, credit card companies, medical offices, health insurers, e-commerce stores, and more. Similarly, a fraudster may assume your identity to gain access to health care services, such as medical checkups, prescription drugs, or pricey medical devices. For instance, if someone uses your health insurance to get prescription drugs from a pharmacy, make sure to alert the pharmacy and your insurer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p aria-level="3"><span data-contrast="none">Ask credit reporting agencies to issue a fraud alert</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:210,&quot;335559740&quot;:450}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A common consequence of identity theft is a dip in the victim’s credit score. For example, a cybercriminal may take out new lines of credit in the victim’s name, accrue credit card debt, and then not pay the balance. For this reason, contacting the credit monitoring bureaus is one of the most important steps to take in identity theft cases.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There are three main agencies in the U.S.: TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. You can get a free credit report from each agency every 12 months via AnnualCreditReport.com. Check the report and note all fraudulent activity or false information and flag it with the relevant bureau’s fraud department. You should also initiate a fraud alert with each agency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A fraud alert requires any creditors to verify your identity before opening a new line of credit. This adds an extra layer of security. An initial fraud alert lasts for 90 days. Once this expires, you can prolong your protection via an extended fraud alert, which will remain valid for seven years. You can notify one of the big three bureaus to set it up. They are then required to notify the other two bureaus.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A credit freeze is another smart move, which you can do through each of the three major credit bureaus. You can either call them or start the process online. This prevents people from accessing your credit report. Lenders, creditors, retailers, landlords, and others may want to see your credit as proof of financial stability. For example, if someone tries to open a phone contract under your name, the retailer may check the credit report. If there is a credit freeze in place, they won’t be able to view it and won’t issue the contract. If you need to allow someone access to your credit report, you can temporarily lift the freeze. And depending on your plan, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/security-freeze?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can issue a credit freeze or an even more comprehensive security freeze right from the McAfee app</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Identity theft is often linked with leaked or hacked passwords. Even if you aren’t sure whether your passwords have been compromised, it’s best to play it safe. Change passwords to any affected accounts. Make sure to use strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts with a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols. A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password manager included with comprehensive online protection software can do the work for you</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> by creating and securely storing them for you. Further, if there’s a chance to activate two-factor authentication on your accounts go ahead and use it as it makes accessing accounts with a stolen password more difficult.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:420}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Realizing that you’ve become a victim carries plenty of emotion with it, which is understandable—the thief has stolen a part of you to get at your money, information, or even reputation. Once that initial rush of anger and surprise has passed, it’s time to get clinical and get busy. Right away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Think like a detective who is building—and closing—a case. That’s exactly what you’re doing.

<p><span data-contrast="none">This form of attack is particularly dangerous for people who re-use passwords across their accounts, as hackers can steal a password from one account and use it to access others.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The email went on to say that PayPal </span><span data-contrast="auto">reset the passwords of the affected accounts and will require affected users to establish a new password the next time they log in to their accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It takes time for companies to discover breaches and other illegal activities on their networks. The activity may have occurred days, weeks, or even months before it was discovered. Thereafter, it takes yet more time for companies to investigate the attack, determine the method of entry, what was affected, and to what extent—not to mention update their security measures as needed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is typical of such attacks. Time passes before victims get notified. And yet more victims may be identified as investigations continue, leaving hackers with a relatively large window of opportunity to do harm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given the nature of the PayPal attack, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself in its aftermath, which involves a combination of preventative steps and some monitoring on your part.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Given that passwords were involved, changing your PayPal password is a must. (As stated, PayPal will require you to do so.)

<p><span data-contrast="auto">While a strong and unique password is a good first line of defense, enabling two-factor authentication across your accounts will help your cause by providing an added layer of security.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">PayPal offers two-factor authentication as an option, and you can enable it by logging into your account settings and then clicking on the “Security” tab.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you spot unusual or unfamiliar transactions on your bank or credit card statements, follow up immediately. That could indicate improper use.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you are contacted by PayPal, make certain the communication is legitimate. Bad actors may pose as PayPal to steal personal information. Do not click on links sent in emails, texts, or messages. Instead, go straight to the PayPal website or contact them by phone directly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">An identity monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can monitor everything from email addresses to IDs and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft.​ Personal information harvested from data breaches can end up on dark web marketplaces where it’s bought by other bad actors so they can launch their own attacks. McAfee’s monitors the dark web for your personal info and provides early alerts if your data is found on there, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​ We also provide guidance to help you act if your information is found.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When personal information gets released, there’s a chance that a hacker, scammer, or thief will put it to use. This may include committing fraud, where they draw funds from existing accounts, and theft, where they create new accounts in a victim’s name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another step that customers can take is to place a credit freeze on their credit reports with the major credit agencies. This will help prevent bad actors from opening new lines of credit or take out loans in a victim’s name by “freezing” their credit report so that potential creditors cannot pull it for reference. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your Social Security or tax ID number is one of the most precious pieces of personal information you have.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Not all data breaches make the news. Businesses and organizations, large and small, have all fallen victim to them, and with regularity. The measures you can take here are measures you can take even if you don’t believe you were caught up in the PayPal breach. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Data breaches typically make the news when it affects a large company and generally only after they discover and release word of it. This means you might not hear about a breach until weeks or even months after your stolen info has been in circulation on the dark web. The measures you can take here can mitigate the damage of such attacks, even if you don&#8217;t think you were caught up in a specific breach. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, you have every reason to act now rather than wait for additional news. Staying on top of our credit and identity has always been important, but given all the devices, apps, and accounts we keep these days leaves us more exposed than ever, making protecting ourselves a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

We’re sending money with payment apps. We’re doing our banking. And we’re using them to set the alarm, turn our lights on and off, see who’s at the front door, and for some of us, even start our cars. The smartphone is evolving, and in many ways, it’s become the “universal remote control” of our lives. And that means it needs protection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Truly, think about all that you do from the palm of your hand. Your phone connects you to so many essential things, it’s tough to think what the day would be like without it—or worse yet, if your phone got stolen or lost. Maybe you know the feeling. That rising panic when you misplace your phone and then the relief you feel when you find it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet you have plenty of ways you can protect yourself and your phone, not only from loss and theft but from hacks and attacks too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Install an online protection app </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> can protect your phone in the same ways that it protects your laptops and computers. Installing it can protect your privacy, keep you safe from attacks on public Wi-Fi, and automatically block unsafe websites and links, just to name a few things it can do. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Set your apps to automatically update</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Updates do all kinds of great things for gaming, streaming, and chatting apps, like add more features and functionality over time. Updates do something else—they make those apps more secure. Hackers will hammer away at apps to find or create vulnerabilities, which can steal personal info or compromise the device itself. Updates will often include security improvements, in addition to performance improvements. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Much the same goes for the operating system on smartphones too.

<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Use a lock screen with a passcode, PIN, facial recognition, or pattern key</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Fewer people use a lock screen than you might think. A finding from </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-connected-family-study-2022-global.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">our recent global research</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> showed that only </span><span data-contrast="auto">56% of adults said that they protect their smartphone with a password or passcode. The problem with going unlocked is that if the phone gets lost or stolen, you’ve basically handed over a large portion of your digital life to a thief. Setting up a lock screen is easy. It’s a simple feature found in both </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-a-passcode-iph14a867ae/15.0/ios/15.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">iOS</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079129?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Android</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> devices.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">So what happens if your phone actually ends up getting lost or stolen? A combination of device tracking, device locking, and remote erasing can help protect your phone and the data on it. Different device manufacturers have different ways of going about it, but the result is the same—you can you’re your phone, prevent others from using it, and even erase it if you’re truly worried that it’s in the wrong hands or simply gone for good. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Steer clear of third-party app stores</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One way hackers work their way into smartphones is through malicious apps that pose as photo editors, VPNs, and games—yet are loaded with malware that spy on your activity or steal account information. Google Play and Apple’s App Store have measures in place to review apps to help ensure that they are safe and secure. Granted, cybercriminals have found ways to work around Google and Apple’s review process, yet they’re quick to remove malicious apps once discovered. Yet third-party app stores and websites likely have no such protections in place. In fact, some third-party sites may intentionally host malicious apps as part of a scam. Stick with the official app stores for a far safer phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Truly, we hold so much in the palm of our hand. Our smartphones connect us to our friends and family, work and livelihoods, banking and finances, and even our homes and the smart devices in them. It’s no exaggeration to say that a good portion of daily life courses through our smartphones. And when we look at them that way, it puts the importance of protecting them in a whole new light. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Homeowners invest in high fences. You may even cover the PIN pad when you type in your secret four-digit code at ATMs. Privacy is key to going about your daily life comfortably in your surroundings. Why shouldn’t privacy also extend to your digital surroundings? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Connect All Your Devices to a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An easy way to instantly boost the privacy of your every online move is to always connect to a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">virtual private network</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (VPN). A VPN scrambles your connected device’s internet session, meaning that it’s impossible for a cybercriminal to eavesdrop on your online comings and goings. VPNs are especially crucial for when you connect to public Wi-Fi networks or networks for which you cannot vouch for their security. Cybercriminals often lurk on public Wi-Fi networks at hotels, coffee shops, and libraries and pounce on users who connect their devices without the protection of a VPN.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Digital privacy not only implies remaining hidden from nefarious eyes, but also from the prying eyes of pesky advertisers. A VPN can assist with that too! When you have a VPN enabled, it confuses advertisers and targeted ads. The less information they have, the more privately you can surf online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Know Where You Stand</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To improve your online privacy, it’s important to first know how safe you currently are. When you can identify your weakest digital privacy habits, you can make targeted improvements to them. Luckily, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/protection-score.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Protection Score</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can help you do just that! Protection Score is a helpful privacy tool that rates your current digital safety. Then, based on your score, the tool offers suggestions on how to boost your score.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For instance, Protection Score searches for your </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) on the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/the-dark-web-a-definitive-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">dark web</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If it finds a copy of your government ID or your financial records on a dubious site, your score will tank. While it may be alarming to have a low Protection Score, you can feel good that you’re making positive waves, hopefully before a cybercriminal takes advantage of your PII and uses it to steal your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are several easy ways to boost your score that require very little effort but have a huge payoff. Connecting to a VPN and running an antivirus scan on your device are just two things you can do and each only takes a few seconds. Changing your habits and turning your online safety around doesn’t have to be overwhelming! In some cases, there are services that’ll even do the work for you, like the service we’ll talk about next.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Clean Up After Your Bad Digital Habits</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To round out your privacy protection toolbox, consider signing up for </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This service is a great companion to Protection Score. While Protection Score identifies all the areas where you can improve your security, Personal Data Cleanup is a service that will remove your information from the web’s riskiest sites. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Did you know that, on average, a person has their PII for sale on 31 sites? Plus, 95% of people haven’t even given their permission and have their personal information for sale on </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/mcafee-personal-data-cleanup-your-partner-in-living-a-more-private-online-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data brokerage sites</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Data brokerage sites are legal and anyone can buy your information. Online advertisers are the usual clients, but a cybercriminal can jump in and buy valuable PII, as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Deck Out Your Protection Toolbox With McAfee+ Ultimate</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You should care about data privacy every day not just when the calendar reminds you on Data Privacy Day. Take the steps and invest in the right solutions to shore up your online defenses. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is an all-in-one service that includes unlimited VPN, Protection Score, a full-service Personal Data Cleanup, and 13 other high-quality identity, privacy, and device security tools. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Online protection software. Antivirus. The two words get used interchangeably often enough. But sure enough, they’re different. And yet directly related when you take a closer look.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The term “antivirus” has been with us for decades now, dating back to the first software that was designed to prevent computers from getting malware—malicious code, like viruses, that would lock up computers, scramble data, or otherwise damage computers and the data on them. Prime examples of these early types of malware include 1999’s “Melissa” virus spreads by infected email attachments and the even more devastating </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/04/this-20-year-old-virus-infected-50-million-windows-computers-in-10-days-why-the-iloveyou-pandemic-matters-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">“ILOVEYOU” virus that incurred billions in damages worldwide</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There’s a good reason why people default to the word “antivirus” so easily. Viruses have been on our collective minds for some time. And computer purchases have often been accompanied by the question, “Do you have antivirus for your computer?” By and large, the notion of antivirus has become pretty much engrained.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet look ahead to today and you can see how dramatically things have changed since those early days. We still need antivirus, that’s for sure. But it takes far more than that to live life safely online right now. And that’s where online protection software comes in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is online protection software?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Online protection software protects you. It includes antivirus, yet it further protects your identity and privacy in addition to your devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The way we use our computers, tablets, and phones nowadays shows the reason why we need such broad protection. We conduct so much of our lives online. We bank, we shop, we plan our finance online. We also run portions of our homes with smart devices and smart speakers. Increasingly, we track our health and wellness with connected devices too—like workouts on our phone and biometrics with consumer-grade and even medical-grade devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">All of this creates data. Data about who we are, what we’re doing, when we’re doing it, how often, and where. That’s precious information. Private information. Personal information. And understandably, that needs to be protected. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Put simply, today’s threats have evolved. While viruses and malware remain a problem, today’s bad actors are out for the bigger games. Like stealing personal and financial info for identity theft. Moreover, organizations large and small collect data from your devices and the things you do on them, personal data that many share and sell for profit. Some of this data collection gets quite exacting, compiled from a broad range of public sources that can include records like bankruptcies, real estate sales, and birth records—plus private sources that can further include your shopping habits, the people you chat with, and what your daily travels look like based on location information captured from your smartphone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you find yourself surprised by this, you’re not alone. Tremendous volumes of data collection activity occur without people’s knowledge or consent.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Now as to why anyone would want any of that kind of data about you, consider the multi-billion-dollar industry of online data brokers. They compile thousands of data points from millions of people and put these vats of data up for sale to anyone who’ll buy them. That could be advertisers, potential employers, private investigators, and background checkers. And it could be bad actors as well who could use your own data to spam, harass, impersonate, or otherwise harm you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Today’s online protection software protects you from today’s threats</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once, so many of these intrusions on our privacy and identity were difficult to spot, let alone prevent. For example, your personal info gets caught up in a data breach and winds up posted for sale on the dark web. How are you to know that before it’s too late and thief racks up umpteen charges on your debit card? Also, with dozens and dozens of data brokers out there, how do you track down which ones have information posted about you and then request to have it taken down? And what if online identity theft happens to you and you’re faced with the time and dollar costs it involves to set things right?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So just as online threats have evolved, so has online protection software. We go about so much of our day online, and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">online protection like our own McAfee+ helps you do it more privately and more safely</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It’s quite comprehensive, and the various plans for McAfee+ include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

That reflects how times have changed. Once it was enough to protect our devices from viruses and malware. Now we have to protect ourselves as well.

So much so that </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/260811/social-network-penetration-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">over 56% of the global population are social media users</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to some degree or other. With all that sharing, conversing, and information passing between family and friends, social media can be a distinct digital extension of ourselves—making it important to know how you can protect your social media accounts from hacks and attacks. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond the sheer number of people who’re on social media, there’s also the amount of time we spend on it.  </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">People worldwide spend an average of 147 minutes a day on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. With users in the U.S. spending just over two hours on social media a day and users in the Philippines spending nearly four hours a day, that figure can vary widely. Yet it’s safe to say that a good portion of our day features time scrolling and thumbing through our social media feeds.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given how much we enjoy and rely on social media, now’s a fine time to give your social media settings and habits a closer look so that you can get the most out of it with less fuss and worry. Whether you’re using Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or whatnot, here are several things you can do that can help keep you safe and secure out there:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Set strong, unique passwords</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Passwords mark square one in your protection, with strong and unique passwords across all your accounts forming primary line of defense. Yet with all the accounts we have floating around, juggling dozens of strong and unique passwords can feel like a task—thus the temptation to use (and re-use) simpler passwords. Hackers love this because one password can be the key to several accounts. Instead, try a password manager that can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Go private</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting, which can help protect your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be critical of the invitations you receive. Out-and-out strangers could be more than just a stranger, they could be a fake account designed to gather information on users for purposes of cybercrime, or they can be an account designed to spread false information. There are plenty of them too. In fact, in Q3 of 2021 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.8 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Reject such requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Think twice before checking in</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nothing says “there’s nobody at home right now” like that post of you on vacation or sharing your location while you’re out on the town. In effect, such posts announce your whereabouts to a broad audience of followers (even a global audience, if you’re not posting privately, as called out above). Consider sharing photos and stories of your adventures once you’ve returned. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. The internet is forever</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s a famous saying for a reason. Whether your profile is set to private or if you are using an app with “disappearing” messages and posts (like Snapchat), what you post can indeed be saved and shared again. It’s as simple as taking a screenshot. If you don’t want it out there, forever or otherwise, simply don’t post it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Watch out for phishing scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re increasingly accustomed to the warnings about phishing emails, yet phishing attacks happen plenty on social media. The same rules apply. Don’t follow any links you get from strangers by way of instant or direct messengers. And keep your personal information close. Don’t pass out your email, address, or other info as well. Even those so-called “quiz” posts and websites can be ruses designed to steal bits and pieces of personal info that can be used as the basis of an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Also keep an eye out for scams of all kinds</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sadly, social media can also be a place where people pull a fast one. Get-rich-quick schemes, romance cons, and all kinds of imposters can set up shop in ads, posts, and even direct messages—typically designed to separate you from your personal information, money, or both. This is an entire topic to itself, and you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/quizzes-and-other-identity-theft-schemes-to-avoid-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">learn plenty more about quizzes and other identity theft scams to avoid on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">8. Review your tags</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some platforms such as Facebook allow users to review posts that are tagged with their profile names. Check your account settings and give yourself the highest degree of control over how and where your tags are used by others. This will help keep you aware of where you’re being mentioned by others and in what way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">9. Protect yourself and your devices</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Security software can protect you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from clicking on malicious links while on social media while steering you clear of other threats like viruses, ransomware, and phishing attacks. It can look out for you as well, by protecting your privacy and monitoring your email, SSN, bank accounts, credit cards, and other personal information. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/id-theft-faq?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With identity theft a rather commonplace occurrence today</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, security software is really a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">10. Check your Protection Score and see how safe you are</span></b></h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGTbCDVwUkI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

It’s an industry first, and it works by taking stock of your overall security and grading it on a scale of 0 to 1,000. From there, it calls out any weak spots and then walks you through the steps to shore it up with personalized guidance. This way, you’re always in the know about your security, privacy, and personal identity on social media and practically wherever else your travels take you online.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most digital bad habits seem insignificant; however, the more bad habits you have that pile-up, the more at risk your PII and your identity can be. Check out this list of three common habits that you should consider breaking today and why.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Volunteering too much information.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you sign up for new online shopping accounts, some companies ask for your birthday, your age, your middle name, and primary and secondary phone numbers and email addresses. While it might be nice to receive a special coupon on your birthday, you may want to reconsider volunteering unnecessary private details. To compromise you can sign up with a nickname and leave your birth year blank. That way, if a cybergang ever breaches the company, the criminals won’t get far with your personal details. To steal an identity and ruin someone’s credit, sometimes all it takes it a full name, birthday, and phone number.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Oversharing on social media.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do you post your every thought and movement on social media? While curating the perfect online profile can be fun, it can also be dangerous to your online safety. For instance, posting “get to know you” quizzes are a gold mine for social engineers and cyber criminals, as the results often reveal potential password inspiration, security question answers, and your likes and dislikes. From here, criminals can take educated guesses at your passwords or tailor a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/its-social-media-day-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-from-social-engineering-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social engineering scheme</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that’s most likely to fool you. Consider setting your social media profiles to private and blocking followers you don’t know personally. Or, just keep parts of your life a mystery to the wider world.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Reusing passwords</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We can all agree that increasingly strict </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-often-should-you-change-your-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password requirements</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are leading to longer and more complex passwords that are confusing to cyber criminals and to the rightful account holders, too! It’s tempting to reuse passwords to reduce the burden on your memory, but this puts your valuable PII in danger. Password and username combinations are often information that’s leaked in company breaches. In what’s called a brute force attack, a cybercriminal can plug that same pairing into hundreds of websites and wait for a hit. Since unique passwords for all your dozens of accounts is imperative, entrust their safekeeping to a password manager. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

That made itself clear at CES this year, which makes a strong case for your security.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The more things we connect, the more data we create. Data about ourselves that companies and others collect, share, and sell—where we are and what we’re doing, along with what we buy, watch, and search for. And today, we’re creating more of it and in more exacting detail. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We connect our homes with smart devices that create data about our comings and goings, and we connect ourselves with smart glasses and watches, rings, and things that track our health, our sleep, and wellness overall. Meanwhile, we have virtual reality and augmented reality hardware companies that want a place on your face with headsets and experiences that will take you into the metaverse.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Walking the floor of this year’s CES, you’ll see all these things, and plenty more. Yet central to it all is one thing—you. Specifically, your privacy and identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As technology evolves so rapidly and brings new ways of experiencing our world, it’s an exciting time. It’s also a somewhat uncertain time. What data will these devices create? Who’ll collect it? What will they do with it? And importantly, what can you do to protect yourself? Questions about your security are very much on our minds, and they’re on yours too. You’ve told us as much. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s where we come in. Just as the floor of CES showcases the evolution of life online, we’re evolving online protection as well. McAfee+ represents that next step—a product line that gives you a full slate of online protection that covers your privacy, identity, and devices so you can enjoy life online with confidence.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the center of that online life is you, and our definition of online protection has become quite expansive as a result.

We see how it can prevent the wrong people from getting their hands on data and info too. And we see how our industry-first Protection Score can show you how safe you are—and offer guidance that can make you safer still. In all, we see it as an online companion, one that removes uncertainty and gives you a feeling of security. Because you truly are secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, protection today demands this comprehensive approach because we go about so much of our day online. McAfee+ reflects that reality. And with that, the various plans for McAfee+ include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The official 40th birthday of the internet serves as a timely reminder that while it is a fantastic place, we must practice good digital hygiene to safeguard our privacy and identity so we can protect ourselves from the latest threats. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since its widely recognized creation on January 1</span><span data-contrast="auto">st</span><span data-contrast="auto"> 1983, the internet has since transformed economies and the everyday lives of people. From social media, memes, and viral videos to smart homes, online shopping and even cloud computing, the internet entertains, educates, and connects us. Above all, it will continue to play a crucial role in human civilization for many generations to come.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet with the good comes the not-so-good. Wherever people gather, cyberthieves gather too. The internet is no exception. As the evolution of the internet continues, cybercriminals are evolving in tandem, looking for new and inventive ways, such as using </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/13/ai-has-bigger-role-in-cybersecurity-but-hackers-may-benefit-the-most.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Artificial</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> Intelligence to exploit its features. </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With over five billion people accessing and using the Internet in 2022</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, that’s over 60% of the world’s population potentially at risk. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, while we celebrate the internet’s 40th birthday, it’s also a good reminder to take stock of the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">latest online threats</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and ensure our digital hygiene is up to scratch for the year ahead. When we do this, we can take full advantage of the incredible opportunities the internet affords us. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The new year is a great moment to reflect, reset, and consider </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">your personal online safety and protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Stay vigilant against the latest threats and scams and use dedicated and robust online protection software such as </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-gb/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.mcafee.com/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">our newly released McAfee+ plans</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—which comes with important features like identity monitoring that can spot your personal info on the dark web and personal data cleanup that can help remove your personal info from data broker sites that will sell it to companies and crooks alike. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s also a time to keep a fresh eye out for scams and phishing attacks. If that email, text, or message you received looks too good to be true, or you feel that the sender is trying to pressure you into doing sharing info or sending money, it’s always best to double check that the source is legitimate. These are often indicators that a scam is afoot.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Four easy things you can do today to improve your safety online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond using online protection software and keeping your guard up, you can take several other steps that can make you immediately safer than you were before. Here are four strong suggestions that will get you started:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">MFA is an excellent way to frustrate cybercriminals attempting to break into online accounts. MFA means that users need more than a username and password to log in, for example, a one-time code sent to private email, text, or through an authentication app utilizing face or fingerprint scans. This adds an extra layer of security as the cybercriminal has to access the device, email, or biometric reader to get into someone’s online account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) Set strong passwords and consider a password manager</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts are a must</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It’s always important for people to understand that reusing passwords is just as risky as using “password123” and puts online accounts at risk. A tactic known as “credential stuffing” is where a cybercriminal attempts to input stolen usernames and password combinations in dozens of random websites to see which door it opens. It is also important to consider using password managers which can create and safeguard all passwords in one secure desktop extension or mobile phone app.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) Update your apps, operating systems, and devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Updating software is vital to the security of a device. These updates include security patches that cyber experts have created to foil cybercriminals. The more outdated the software is, the more time criminals have had to work out ways to infiltrate and steal information within them. Moreover, updates often include new and improved features, which makes a strong case for keeping things current.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Recognise and report phishing</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing is when a scammer sends texts or emails that appear to be from trusted sources like your favourite online clothing store, employer or, as we’re seeing during the cost-of-living crisis, energy firms, or banks. They do this to encourage people to share personal information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing attempt</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> has been recognised it is vital that they are not engaged with, links are left unopened, and the potential scam email is not forwarded along to another person. Before the message is deleted, it is vital that the sender is blocked and that the message is marked as junk and reported. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you think that you have entered your credit card details onto a phishing website, contact your bank or credit card issuing company immediately. Report your personal information as stolen, and you may want to request that your existing card be canceled depending on the circumstances.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Staying safer still in 2023—and then some</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Online protection is part mindset, part prevention, and part action. While the steps above mark a start, they’re just that. There’s plenty more you can do, and when taken in batches, the steps you take can really add up to an exceptional level of protection. The question is, where to start?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/reports-and-guides.html"><span data-contrast="none">Our McAfee Safety Series</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can get you moving in the right direction. It’s a set of guides that cover a range of important security topics and that show you several straightforward things you can do that will make you safer. They range from phishing and privacy to online shopping and safer online media. In all, they can help you spot scams, hacks, and attacks—and potentially prevent them in the first place. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I encourage you to grab the first one that looks interesting to you. What you learn can put you several steps ahead of the hackers, scammers, and thieves out there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

With that, we have your back. And here’s why. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., reported cases of identity theft continue to rise. </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20half%20of,for%20the%20six%2Dmonth%20period." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">In the first half of 2022</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported more than 600,000 cases of identity theft, with more than 230,000 of those reported cases involving credit card theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And that’s just what’s been reported in the U.S. Far more crime goes unreported, and </span><a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/content/Javelin-2021-Identity-Fraud-Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">it is estimated that the cost of identity theft and fraud goes well into the billions of dollars</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet behind each stat is a person, a family, and a household that dealt with anything from a financial headache to a major life event no thanks to identity theft and fraud. Accordingly, we’re seeing to it that every person has the tools to prevent this from happening to them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s a little bit about our approach. We looked at some of the key areas where people’s private information can be vulnerable and rolled out a set of features and services that can help make you safer than before. They’re all part of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+, our latest line of comprehensive online protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Depending on your plan and location, the following offer protections that can look after you, your privacy, and your identity—along with your devices and the things on them too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Connect safely with a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unsecured networks can leave us vulnerable, like when we use public Wi-Fi. What’s at issue is that a cybercriminal can potentially capture your login credentials and other personal information as you use a public network in a hotel, airport, coffee shop, library, and so forth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, we made sure to include a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to keep your information protected from prying eyes. It does this easily by detecting when you’re on a public network and automatically turning on your VPN. The VPN then scrambles or encrypts, your data as it flows over the network. Unlike some VPNs that require advanced settings to shield your data, our app offers seamless security.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Dark web monitoring</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that data breaches large and small continue to occur with more regularity than any of us would like, always-on monitoring of your private information is key.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether one of your personal accounts is hacked–or worse–another website somehow gets ahold of your data and subsequently gets breached, your data may end up on the dark web. This is where cybercriminals buy and sell information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To detect these dangerous leaks, we included dark web monitoring, which alerts you if your log-in credentials have been exposed. It can even provide you with a link to the site that uses those credentials when the information is available. This allows you to swiftly reset your passwords, mitigating the risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Personal data cleanup</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We&#8217;ll scan some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. We’ll also provide guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and with select products, we can even manage the removal for you. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Identity theft insurance and recovery support</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Recovering from identity fraud or theft can be expensive. Not to mention time consuming. We’ll help relieve the burden with $1M coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Should the unfortunate happen to you, we have your back. In several ways. We offer licensed recovery experts who can work with you any time, around the clock, all year long. These pros can use a limited power of attorney to do the heavy lifting for identity recovery, taking all necessary steps to repair identity and credit. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Ransomware coverage</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our all-new ransomware coverage is now available, ready to help just in case—all backed by expert advice to help you find the quickest and best possible path to recovery. In addition to eligibility for up to $25,000 in reimbursement due to ransomware losses, our team of experts can help you, determine the severity of a ransomware attack and learn what immediate action steps you can take. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Protection score</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Knowing your safe and staying that way just got far simpler. With a colorful view, you can see exactly what your Protection Score is at a glance, which compiles your overall levels of security, privacy, and identity theft protection. Better yet, if it spots gaps in your protection, it guides you through straightforward fixes that can make you safer than before.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s an industry first, and something we all deserve—the ability to clearly see exactly how secure you are and to quickly shore up your protection whenever it’s needed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Credit monitoring</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Everyone has credit, and everyone needs to protect it. McAfee’s Credit Monitoring does just that. Whether the suspicious change in your report is big or small, we can help you detect it—and take the right steps to correct it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Credit freeze</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can put proactive protection in place by stopping unauthorized access to existing credit card, bank, and utility accounts or from new ones being opened in your name. Security freezes stop companies from looking at your credit profile, which halts the application process for loans, credit cards, utilities, new bank accounts, and more. A security freeze won&#8217;t affect your credit score. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Ease of use</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also on our list, we wanted to make personal protection easy to use and available across all your compatible devices. So, whether you’re out with just your phone, or at home working at your PC, you have access to your protection, and can even pick up where you left off on a different device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">It’s about enjoying the internet</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ultimately, that’s what any of us want—to enjoy the internet with confidence, knowing that whatever it is we’re doing online is secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The way we use the internet continues to evolve. After all, it wasn’t long ago that the idea of using a phone to see who’s at the front door may have seemed a bit odd. Let alone having a little chat with the speaker on your kitchen counter. Yet that’s where we are today. And as the internet evolves, so will we. The protection we offer will cover your increasingly connected life in whatever shape that takes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">No question about it. We’re committed to protecting you, your privacy, your identity, and certainly your devices too—and making all of it simple.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s to a happy and secure year!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Guide-Protecting-Credit.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Guide-Protecting-Credit.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Guide-Protecting-Credit-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="none">It has a way of sneaking up on you. Credit theft and fraud. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Maybe it’s happened to you. Maybe it’s happened to a friend or family member. There’s a call from the bank, a notification in your financial app, or a charge on the statement that’s beyond explanation. Someone else has tapped into your funds. Or worse yet, someone stole your identity and took out a loan in your name. You find out only after it’s happened.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That’s the trick with credit theft and fraud. People typically discover it after the damage is done. Then they’re left picking up the pieces, which can cost both time and money. Not to mention a potential knock to their credit score.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, you can help keep it from happening to you. Our recently published Credit Protection Security Guide breaks down several ways. Here we’ll get into a quick introduction on the topic and show how you can prevent against credit theft and fraud better than ever before.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protecting yourself from credit theft and fraud</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s an unfortunate reality in the world we live in today</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Credit theft and fraud are something we all need to look out for, particularly as we increasingly shop and conduct our finances online, potentially exposing that information to thieves. </span><a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/card-industry-faces-400b-in-fraud-losses-over-next-decade-nilson-says/611521" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Some figures</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> estimate that for nearly every $100 in purchases made with debit and credit cards worldwide, somewhere around 7 cents can be stolen or fraudulent. As you can imagine, that figure adds up quickly, to the tune of more than $28 billion globally each year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The flipside is this: today we have plenty of tools that make protecting our credit far easier than they ever were before. Up until now, that called for a time-consuming and sometimes rather manual process. You had to check credit separately with the different bureaus, place locks and freezes the same way, scan each credit report closely for suspicious activity, and so forth.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Now, online protection software can take much of that work off your hands. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive protection like McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> has plans that offer credit monitoring, identity monitoring, and even identity theft protection &amp; restoration—all quickly spotting any changes, notifying you if your personal information pops up on the dark web, and providing $1 of coverage toward restoring your credit along with the help of a licensed recovery pro if the unexpected happens to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Leaving less of a trail for thieves to follow</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another thing online protection can do for you removes your personal information from those “people finder” and data broker sites. Identity thieves lean on those sites because they contain valuable information that they can piece together to commit theft and fraud in someone else’s name. If you think about your identity as a big jigsaw puzzle, these sites contain valuable pieces that can help complete the picture—or just enough to take a crack at your credit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In fact, personal information fuels </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global data trading economy estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars a year</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Run by data brokers that keep hundreds and even thousands of </span><a href="https://sites.sanford.duke.edu/techpolicy/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/08/Data-Brokers-and-Sensitive-Data-on-US-Individuals-Sherman-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data points on billions of people</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, these sites gather, analyze, buy, and sell this information to other companies as well as to advertisers. Likewise, these data brokers may sell this information to bad actors, such as hackers, spammers, and identity thieves who would twist this information for their own purposes. In short, data brokers don’t discriminate. They’ll sell personal information to anyone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Getting your info removed from these sites can seem like a daunting task. (Where do I start, and just how many of these sites are out there?) Our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup can help by regularly scanning these high-risk data broker sites</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for you and info associated with you like your home address, date of birth, and names of relatives—along with other detailed information about you that could include marriage licenses, voter registration and motor vehicle records, even real estate records too. It identifies which sites are selling your data, and depending on your plan, automatically requests removal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Take control of your credit</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">How things have changed. Even as thieves have gotten savvier in the digital age, so have we. Collectively, we have a growing arsenal of ways that we can keep on top of our credit and protect ourselves from credit theft and fraud. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our Credit Protection Security Guide breaks it all down in detail. In it, you’ll learn more about how thieves work, ways you can secure your credit online and off, how to monitor and lock it down, plus protect your mobile wallets too. It’s thorough. Yet you’ll find how straightforward the solution is. A few changes in habits and a few extra protections at your side will go a long way toward prevention—helping you avoid that call, text, or notification that your credit has been compromised.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, you can take control of your credit and make sure you’re the only one putting it to good use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Recognise-Online-Scam.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Recognise-Online-Scam.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/300x200_Blog_Recognise-Online-Scam-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s been a particularly busy and colourful week, scam-wise in our household. Between 4 family members, we’ve received almost 20 texts or emails that we’ve identified as scams. And the range was vast: from poorly written emails offering ‘must have’ shopping deals to terse text messages reprimanding us for overdue tolls plus the classic ‘Dear mum, I’ve smashed my phone’ and everything in between.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s no doubt that scammers are dedicated opportunists who can pivot fast. They can pose as health authorities during a pandemic, charities after a flood or even your next big love on an online dating platform. And it’s this chameleon ability that means we need to always be on red alert!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Big An Issue Are Scams in Australia?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), </span><a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/scams-robbed-australians-of-more-than-2-billion-last-year"><span data-contrast="none">Aussies lost a record amount of more than $2 billion in scams in 2021</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. And that was with record levels of intervention from the government, law enforcement agencies and the private sector. The most lucrative scams were investment scams ($701 million) followed by payment redirection scams ($227 million) and then romance scams which netted a whopping $142 million.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But the psychological trauma that is often experienced by victims can be equally as devastating. Many individuals will require extensive counselling and support in order to move on from the emotional scarring from being a victim of hacking.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, with scammers putting so much energy into trying to lure us into their web, how can we stay one step ahead of these online schemers and ensure we don’t become a victim?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What You Can Do To Stay Ahead Of The Scammers</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there are no guarantees in life, there are a few steps you can take so that you can quickly recognise an online scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Slow Down</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’ve received a text message, email or call that you think is a scam, don’t respond. Take your time. Slow down and pause. If it’s a call, and you’re not sure – hang up! Or if it’s a text or email &#8211; delete it! But if you are concerned that it might be legitimate, call the company directly using the contact information from their official website or through their secure apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Think First</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you are being asked to share your personal information or pay money either via a text or phone call, take some time to think. Does it feel legitimate? Do you have a relationship with this organisation? Remember, scammers are very talented at pretending they are from organisations you know and trust. If in doubt, contact the company directly via their official communication channels. Or ask a trusted friend or family member for their input. But remember, NEVER click on any links in messages from people or organisations you don’t know – no exceptions!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. If Concerned, Act Fast! </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do not hesitate to take action if something feels wrong. If there are any transactions on your credit card or bank statements that don’t look right, call your bank immediately. If you think you may have given personal information to scammers, then act fast. I recommend calling </span><a href="https://www.idcare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ID Care</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> &#8211; Australia and New Zealand’s national identity and cyber support service. They are a not-for-profit charity that provides support to individuals affected by identity and cyber security issues.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ReportCyber</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is another way of notifying authorities of a scam.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’ve all heard that ‘prevention is better than a cure’ so taking some time to protect yourself before a scammer comes your way is a no-brainer. Here are my top 5 things to do:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

With many of us living busy lives and not taking the time to think critically, it’s inevitable that some of us will become victims. And remember if you’re offered a deal that just seems too good to be true, then it’s likely a scam! Hang up or press delete!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

That January 1</span><span data-contrast="auto">st</span><span data-contrast="auto"> promise looks different to everyone: snacking less often, going to the gym more often, drinking more water, drinking less soda, etc. This year, instead of a juice cleanse subscription, opt for a healthier habit that’s not an unappetizing shade of green: follow this digital detox, instead! In three easy steps, you can make great strides in </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">improving your digital wellness</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Update</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are various aspects of your digital habits that you should consider updating for a more private and safer online life. For starters, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/this-world-password-day-heres-how-a-password-manager-can-simplify-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">update your passwords</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Do you reuse the same password for multiple online accounts? Doing so puts your </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) at great risk. For example, if a business with which you have an online shopping account is breached by a cybercriminal, your login and password combination could make it on the dark web, through no fault of your own. Then, through a brute force attack, a criminal could use that same password and username combo to walk into your banking or tax filing accounts.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Remembering unique, complicated passwords and passphrases for your dozens of online accounts would be impossible. Luckily, there’s software that remembers them for you! It’s called a password manager, which acts as a vault for all your login information. Just remember one master password, and you can be confident in the security of your accounts and never have to deal with the hassle of forgetting passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another aspect of updating you should adopt in 2023 is making an effort to always upgrade to the latest software updates on all your devices. The easiest way to do this is to turn on automatic updates. From there, you don’t need to take any further action! Apps and operating systems (like Apple, Android, and Windows) often release updates to patch security vulnerabilities. When you run outdated software, there’s a chance a cybercriminal could take advantage of that security gap.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, make sure that you keep updated on the latest security headlines. Consider setting up news alerts to notify you when a breach occurs at a company that you frequent or have an account with. Speed is often key in making sure that your information remains safe, so it’s best practice to have your finger on the pulse on the security news of the day.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Connect</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A new year digital detox can be a whole family affair. Connect with your family, anyone connected to your home network, and your </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/how-to-talk-to-your-grandparents-about-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">elderly relatives</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to get everyone on the same page with security best practices. Here are some common online security snags people of all ages encounter:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Social media oversharing.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Everyone has an oversharer on their newsfeed. Alert your family members of the dangers of posting too much about their personal life. When someone takes those “get to know you” quizzes and posts their answers, cybercriminals can use that post to take educated guesses at your passwords. Additionally, social engineers can tailor </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/its-social-media-day-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-from-social-engineering-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social media scams</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to specific people in order to increase the chances of tricking someone into sending money or sharing valuable personal or banking details.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Falling for phishing.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While spam filters catch a lot of phishing emails, phishers are getting smarter by the day and are making their attempts more and more believable. Connect with your loved ones and make sure they know how to recognize phishing emails, texts, and social media direct messages. Telltale signs of a phishing message include: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re ever unsure if a message is a phishing attempt, the best course of action is to just delete it. If the “sender” is a well-known institution, follow up with a phone call using the official customer service number listed on their website. The phisher may also claim to be someone you know personally. In that case, give the loved one in question a phone call. It’s a good excuse to reconnect and have a nice conversation!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Visiting unsafe sites.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the quest for free streams of the latest new show or movie, people often encounter unsafe sites that hide malware, spyware or other types malicious links and programs. Some types of malware can jump from one device to others connected to the same home Wi-Fi network. That’s why it’s important to make sure everyone under your roof practices excellent digital security habits. One wrong click could sink an entire household. Consider signing up your family for a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser.html"><span data-contrast="none">safe browsing extension</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that can notify you when you stray onto a risky site. So, instead of putting your device at risk during movie night, connect with your friends or loved ones over one copy of a safely and officially purchased version.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Balance</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with any new health regimen, immediately zooming from zero to a hundred will likely be overwhelming and result in failure. The same goes for adopting new digital safety habits. If you try to do too much at once, all the security measures you put in place will likely get in the way of your daily online activities. The more inconvenient it is, the more likely you may be to cut corners; thus, negating all the progress you’ve made.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Being cybersafe doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy your connected devices to the fullest. It just means that you may need to act with more intention and slow down before volunteering personal details online or clicking on links. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

(Yes, there’s a day for that.) Today is an excellent day to share downloading best practices to keep all your devices safe from malicious content. It’s tempting to download “free” shows, movies, and video games, but the consequences of doing so can be quite expensive. All it takes is for one malicious download to compromise your identity or leak your banking information to cybercriminals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Luckily, there are a few ways to </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">keep your devices and personally identifiable information (PII) safe</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Here’s how!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Dangers of Downloading Dubious Content</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How many streaming services do you subscribe to? Two? Ten? No matter how many premium entertainment subscriptions you have, the hottest new show always seems to be on the channel you can’t access. This is a common scenario that often drives people to download episodes from websites that claim crystal-clear, safe downloads. In actuality, these sites could harbor malware, spyware, or </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">other types of malware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that lurk in the shadows until an unsuspecting person downloads them to their desktop, tablet, or cellphone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/how-to-quickly-remove-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Malware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which stands for malicious software, often hides behind legitimate-looking links or downloadable content. It’s only until it’s on your device that you realize there&#8217;s a criminal hiding behind it. For example, earlier in 2022, a ransomware program (a type of malware) </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/ransomware-masquerading-as-microsoft-update-targets-home-computers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">disguised itself as a Microsoft system update</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The criminal behind the scheme then threatened leaking or permanently deleting sensitive files if the person didn’t pay the ransom.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once malware infects one device, some malware programs can infect an entire home network and spread to other connected devices.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> From there, the cybercriminal can steal the online shopping, banking, or personal details of a whole household and either sell their findings on the dark web or keep it for themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, while downloading entertainment for free is appealing to people on a budget, it’s better to avoid doing so altogether. The risk isn’t worth it. Consider scheduling a watch party with a friend or family member who has the subscription service you’re seeking. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you suspect you’ve been affected by identity theft, acting quickly is key to stopping the thief and repairing the damage. Here are the definitive five steps of identity remediation, or the process of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">restoring and protecting the privacy of your identity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Freeze Your Credit</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With a stolen identity in hand, thieves can open new lines of credit or apply for large loans using someone else’s excellent credit score for leverage. If undetected, fraudsters can run up huge bills, never pay them, and in turn, ruin the credit score that you spent years perfecting. When you suspect or confirm that your identity has been compromised and you’re in the United States, alert the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/credit-lock-and-credit-freeze-which-service-is-best-for-you-both/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Freezing your credit</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> means that no one (not even you) can open a new credit card or bank account. This prevents criminals from misusing your identity. Initiating a credit freeze is free and it doesn’t affect your credit score. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. File a Report</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you suspect a criminal has stolen your identity, file a report with the Federal Trade Commission. Its </span><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">official identity theft website</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> includes a form for you to detail the circumstances. From there, the FTC will investigate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s important to file a report because law enforcement can get involved and hopefully stop the criminal from striking again. Also, an official document from law enforcement or the FTC may help your bank and the credit bureaus resolve the damage.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Change Your Passwords and Credit Cards</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whenever a company with which you have an account is breached, the first step you should take is to quickly change your password. The same goes for when your identity is compromised with the added step of getting in touch with your banks and asking their fraud department to issue you new credit and debit cards and put them on alert for possible suspicious charges.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Having unique passwords for all your accounts is crucial to keeping them secure. For instance, if one of your accounts is breached and a cybercriminal lifts that username and password combination, they may then attempt to use it on other sites. To ensure you have strong passwords and passphrases for every site, consider using password manager software. Password managers are incredibly secure and make it so you only have to remember one password ever again. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Collaborate With Credit Bureaus</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to freezing your credit, you may have to sync up with each bureau to remedy any damage the identity thief may have done to your credit. Each bureau’s fraud department is very familiar with these scenarios, so their customer service department is experienced and more than willing to help you work through it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Sign Up for Credit Monitoring</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you’ve cleaned up the immediate mess made by an identity thief, it’s important to continuously monitor your identity in case the thief is biding their time or pieces of your PII are still circulating on the dark web. Plus, the headache of one compromised identity incident is enough for someone to never want it to happen again. Identity monitoring is a very thorough process that will give you peace of mind that you’ll be protected and can enjoy your online life safely. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These five steps, while important, can be tedious. It may require a lot of patience to sit on hold and sift through all the relevant forms.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/300x200_MythBusting.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/300x200_MythBusting.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/300x200_MythBusting-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">The number of new viruses grows every day. In fact, McAfee registers an average of 1.1 million new malicious programs and potentially unwanted apps (PUA) each day, which contributes to the millions and millions already in existence. While there is no way to know when or how cyberattacks will occur, it’s clear that antivirus software is one of the best ways to ensure you, and your devices, are safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite its proven strengths, some long-standing myths question the effectiveness of antivirus. To set the record straight, we’ve debunked five of the most common </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">antivirus software </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">myths, so you can rest assured that you are safely navigating the evolving cyber landscape.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Myth 1: Antivirus software slows down your device</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We expect a lot from our devices—faster performance every time the latest model is released. As a result, many are reluctant to install apps or software that may jeopardize device performance, including antivirus software.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many believe that antivirus software will slow down your devices. However, contrary to popular belief, quality antivirus software can improve device performance by using advanced optimizations. It’s this simple: antivirus software conducts regular system-wide scans to identify and prevent viruses and improve performance without compromising efficacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To run these scans, antivirus software requires system resources, which is where this myth originates. If you download or operate more than one antivirus program or download the wrong version for your system, then yes, your device will slow to a crawl. That is why it is essential to install one high-quality antivirus software that meets all your devices’ system requirements. Additionally, best-in-class antivirus software can be set to run during specific hours to avoid delays during the busiest times of your day.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Myth 2: Antivirus software only protects against a few viruses</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The number of malware strains and potentially unwanted applications (PUA) increases every year. It is understandable why people might think that antivirus software cannot protect against them all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, antivirus software can provide extensive protection against the majority of malicious programs. It does so in two ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li data-leveltext="%1)" data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1)&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">It protects you from existing threats based on an extensive list of known threats, which is updated regularly (a good reason to set your software to update automatically rather than manually).</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="%1)" data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1)&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">It protects you from entirely new threats with behavioral detection and machine learning to detect, isolate, and eliminate zero-day digital threats (brand new threats that haven&#8217;t been seen before). This approach integrates deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to emulate human-like reasoning and accurately detect threats. In addition, behavioral heuristic-based detection finds new viruses by assessing known malicious behavior, such as abnormal application demands and instructions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, a known list of threats paired with the unique capabilities of machine learning, data science, and AI for advanced threat detection enable antivirus software to protect against a wide range of existing and evolving threats.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Myth 3: Independent third-party test results are useless</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Can you imagine grading your own driving test? You could omit the dreaded three-point turn and pass with flying colors, but the result wouldn’t be as accurate as that of an unbiased evaluator. This same concept applies to evaluating the efficacy of computer security. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s easy for a company to set up a test environment where they highlight all the excellent capabilities of their antivirus software and gloss over its shortcomings. It’s equally as easy for a company to commission a third-party to conduct a custom test painting the company in a good light. However, the results will not be as comprehensive or accurate as those from an independent third-party. Additionally, they also will not provide a comparative analysis with other company offerings to help users draw their own conclusions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Independent third-party test results offer a more thorough </span><a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/june-2022/mcafee-total-protection-26.0-221312/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">evaluation of antivirus software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. They also do a better job at evaluating security features. Furthermore, ISO-certified independent third parties lend transparency and credibility to the techniques used and ensure that evaluations align with industry standards.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Myth 4: Apple products can’t get viruses</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There is a common belief that Apple products are protected against viruses because cybercriminals often target Windows and Android operating systems. However, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/can-apple-computers-get-viruses/?hilite=%27viruses%27%22%20\" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are just as vulnerable to viruses as any other computer or smartphone. Regardless of your device or operating system—macOS, iOS, Windows, or Android—if it connects to a network, it’s susceptible to viruses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Windows and Android</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> have long been the dominant operating systems for computers and smartphones. That’s why macOS and iOS have, up until recently, been the lesser focus for cybercriminals. The problem is that cybercriminals want to spread their viruses to the platforms with the largest customer base which just so happens to be Windows and Android. As Apple products continue to grow in popularity, cybercriminals will continue coming out with more viruses specifically targeting Macs, iPhones, and other </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/apple-ios-attack-underscores-importance-of-threat-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">iOS devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Myth 5: You are 100% protected if you have antivirus software</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Antivirus software is not a guarantee of protection against all viruses. Some malware can and will slip through. This is where antivirus software’s ability to detect and remove malware comes in. Ours comes with a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html#:~:text=Virus%20Protection%20Pledge,your%20money%20back.**?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Virus Protection Pledge</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which provides a 100% guarantee we’ll remove viruses on your devices, or we’ll give you your money back, all as part of your automatically renewable subscription.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, viruses and malware are just one form of attack that hackers and bad actors will wage on their victims. They’ll also make attempts at identity theft or likewise try to invade your privacy—with the intent of stealing passwords, account information, and personal information, which could drain your debit cards, damage your credit, or otherwise impersonate you for their financial gain.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In this way, antivirus is just one form of protection. To truly stay safe as possible online, you need online protection software that looks after your identity and privacy as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+ Ultimate offers our most comprehensive coverage</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, with </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Fact vs. Fiction: Know what antivirus software can do for you</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is necessary to bust common myths about antivirus software to protect yourself and your family from cyberthreats. By educating yourself and selecting a best-in-class antivirus software that’s further bolstered by identity and privacy protection, you will be well on your way to implementing an effective protection strategy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

But the holiday season can also be a little overwhelming when you’re the one ‘in charge’. Whether it’s prepping for the inevitable influx of new devices, buying the gifts or booking the holiday – there are a lot of online safety considerations to workshop in addition to how you’re going to stuff the turkey and decorate the tree!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, with the Christmas spirit running through my keyboard, I hereby share with you my top tips to help you keep you and your family safe online this holiday period.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Have a Safety Plan for ALL New Devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all know that Santa loves technology so it’s inevitable that your family members may find a new device or two under the tree this year. So, as soon as they have unboxed their shiny new item, I recommend on insisting on a few steps to both protect the device and its new owner:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Change the default passcode or set up a new one immediately</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Check for software updates – these ensure that any bugs or weak spots are addressed</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Choose a ‘back-up’ solution. If it’s an iPhone, iCloud can work. I’m a fan of </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/official-site?_tk=paid_sem_goog_biz_b&amp;_camp=1018334780&amp;_kw=dropbox|e&amp;_ad=431524417428||c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAqOucBhDrARIsAPCQL1YBewHRfiIUAvrdG3PC4hzdCPn4tC1bt_uyRzcnntzfKhJ6aLRLFJYaAg9vEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Dropbox</span></a> <span data-contrast="auto">as it works so well on both phones and laptops.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Invest in a security solution. If you already have a premium subscription to an online security solution like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> then you’ll likely be able to add the new devices (phones, tablets or laptops) to your family plan. If not, consider investing. Not only will it protect devices from viruses and phishing attacks, but it will also help you locate it if it ever gets misplaced- very common occurrence in my household!     </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Online Shopping</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Getting to the bottom of the Christmas gift list takes time particularly if you are ‘lucky’ enough to get COVID before Christmas, like myself! While there are still some retailers guaranteeing delivery before Christmas – including Amazon until Christmas Eve (phew!) – you might need to focus on gift cards if you don’t want to face the hordes at the shops. Regardless of what you buy, please follow the following online shopping tips to avoid being cyberscrooged this year:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="4" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Only buy from trusted retailers – even if it costs a few more dollars</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Book Your Holiday From a Reputable Online Site</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I don’t think there would be anything more disappointing than anticipating a holiday only to have it not happen. Or, to be scammed while preparing for it. With holiday makers having to jump through more hoops thank to COVID requirements, many experts are predicting scammers will be turning their attention to creating fake COVID verification sites, designed purely to extract personal details from unsuspecting holiday makers. So, if you’re booking a holiday, or doing your admin for it, please do the following:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Take a moment to verify – check the website URL to ensure it leads to where you expect before clicking and paying.

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Be Careful What You Share Online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With so many of us busting with excitement to be travelling this holiday season for the first time in a few years, it’s inevitable that we want to share online. But, please think before you post. Checking in to airports or hotels online is really a way of alerting the online world to the fact that your house is likely unattended! And please make sure your kids understand this too. I appreciate there’s a lot of kudos for sharing holidays snaps in the moment but encourage your offspring to wait until you get home before sharing. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_122122.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_122122.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_122122-191x129.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">For many Aussies, identity theft was always something that happened to other people. People on TV, usually. But the recent spate of data breaches at Optus, Medibank and Energy Australia has made many of us pay far more attention than ever to one of the fastest growing crimes in our country. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the </span><a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/criminal-justice/cybercrime-identity-security/identity-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Department of Home Affairs</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, 1 in 4 Aussies will be the victim of identity theft over the course of their lives with an annual economic impact of more than $2 billion. And with the financial fallout from the recent data breaches only just starting to be counted, these statistics will no doubt increase dramatically next year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Actually Is Identity Theft?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft is when a cybercriminal gains access to your personal information to steal money or gain other benefits. Armed with your personal info, they can apply for real identity documents in your name but with another person’s photograph. This enables them to then apply for loans or benefits in your name, sign up for memberships or even apply for credit cards.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And it goes without saying that the financial and emotional fallout from identity theft can be huge. Since the Optus and Medibank hacking stories broke just a few months ago, there has been multiple stories of Aussie families who have had their identities stolen and who are in a world of pain. This </span><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/melbourne-family-loses-40k-from-suspected-identity-theft-after-optus-data-breach-20221104-p5bvj3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Melbourne family who have had over $40,000 stolen from ATM withdrawals alone is just one example</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Do You Mean By Personal Information?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your personal information is any piece of information or data that can confirm who you are or how to find you. It may be a single piece of information, or several pieces used together. It’s often referred to as personally identifiable information (PII). So, it includes your name, parents’ name, address, date of birth, phone numbers, email address, usernames/passwords or passphrases, bank account details, school or university attended, location check-ins even RSVPS for events.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Every time you register with a new shopping site or social media platform, you will be asked to share some personally identifiable information. However, what you share may be stolen or even misused – just think about the recent list of Australian companies who had their customers’ private information stolen by hackers. So that’s why you need to ensure you are only sharing your information with trusted online sites and take every possible step to protect your personal information online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How To Protect Your Online Identity</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there are no guarantees in life, there are steps you can take to ensure your online identity is as safe as possible. Here are my top 5 tips:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Use Multi-Factor Authentication When It’s Offered – Always!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) is a no-brainer because it makes a hacker’s life a lot harder. In short, it requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account or app. This might be a text, email or even a code generated by an authentication app. So, even if a hacker has your password and username, they still need that final piece of information before they can get their hands on your account!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Use A Different (and Complex) Password On Every Account</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now this may take a bit of work to set up but using a unique and complex password on every account is one of the best things you can do to protect your online identity. And here’s the rationale &#8211; if you use the same password on all your accounts and your login details are stolen then hackers have access to all the accounts that are accessed with that password. Yikes!!! So, a unique password for each account is a great measure. I love using a password manager to make this process a little easier. Not only do they generate complex passwords, but they remember them too! All you need to do is remember your Master Password which needs to be extremely complex!!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Keep Your Devices and Software Updated &amp; Backed-Up</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Updates are most commonly about addressing security weaknesses. And yes, I know they can be a pain but if you ignore them, you are essentially making it easier for hackers to find their way into your life via weak spots. And don’t forget to ensure your security software remains updated too!  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I always recommend keeping a backup of all your important info in case something goes wrong. This should include all your photos, key documents and all your personally identifiable information. A hard drive works well but saving to the cloud is also a good option. I once dropped a hard drive and lost treasured family photos, so the cloud is my personal preference.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Stay Ahead of The Threats &#8211; Invest in a Security &amp; Identity Protection Solution </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all know knowledge is power so investing in top notch security and identity monitoring software will help keep you ahead of threats. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, McAfee’s new all in one privacy, identity and device protection solution is a fantastic way for Aussies to protect themselves online. It features identity monitoring and a password manager but also an unlimited VPN, a file shredder, protection score and parental controls. And the Rolls Royce version called McAfee+ Advanced, also offers subscribers additional identity protections including access to licensed restoration experts who can help you repair your identity and credit, in case you’re affected by a data breach. It also gives subscribers access to lost wallet protection which help you cancel and replace your ID, credit cards if they are lost or stolen.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Only Use Secure Wi-Fi or a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Public, unsecured Wi-Fi can make life so much easier when you’re out and about but it’s also a tried and tested way for scammers to access your personal information. Unsecured Wi-Fi is free Wi-Fi that is available in public places such as libraries, cafes, or shopping centres. So, instead of using Wi-Fi, just use the data in your phone plan. Or alternatively invest in a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that cleverly encrypts everything you share on your device.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">About 2 months ago, I embarked on a project to clean up my online life. I’m working through the list of sites I have accounts with and am closing those I no longer use, I’m also doing a huge password audit to ensure they are all unique to each site and are super complex, thanks to my password manager. Now, I’m not quite done yet, but things are in better shape than they were. Why not consider doing the same? With the holiday season fast approaching, why not dedicate a little of your poolside time to practicing a little cyber hygiene.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Till next time, keep those identities safe!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

At least when it comes to keeping it more private and secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Without question, smart home devices have truly stormed the marketplace. We’ve gone from a handful of relatively straightforward things like connected lights, outlets, and cameras to a wide range of fully connected household appliances like refrigerators, stoves, and laundry machines. You can even water your garden with smart devices, which check for soil moisture, weather reports, and for what you’re watering.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Further new technologies like the Matter protocol aim to make them all work more reliably and easily—with a new networking standard that allows different devices from different platforms to work together. Something they couldn’t do before and something that likely kept people from adding to their connected home because of compatibility issues. No more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It&#8217;s exciting, as it should be. Yet the security and privacy measures for these devices hasn’t quite kept up with all this rapid development and expansion. Not across the board, anyway. Security isn’t always built into these devices. In some cases, it’s so poorly handled that it makes some devices prone to attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, you can absolutely enjoy a smart home and all the comforts and conveniences that come along with it. Safely. Just a little extra effort from you makes it possible. And you don’t need to be any kind of whiz to pull it off. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Why security for your smart appliances and smart devices counts</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For starters, the old security adage holds true for smart homes and devices: “If it’s connected, it must be protected.” Any connected device can provide a hacker with an inroad to your home network and the data and devices on it. So even that seemingly innocent smart wall outlet that you use to run your living room lamps could be a target. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In fact, we’ve seen instances where a little outlet created a big security issue, such as one </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/hackers-can-use-popular-smart-plugs-to-break-into-your-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">report</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> where an unsecure plug used poor factory passwords and didn’t use secure encryption to communicate with the household router. The result—hackers could obtain login credentials to a victim’s entire home network.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another old security adage is that your home network is only as secure as your weakest device. In the above case, that was a poorly designed smart outlet—at least from a security standpoint.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Now consider a highly connected smart home with a dozen or so smart devices. Maybe some of those have great security built in and are backed by manufacturers that update them regularly for ongoing security. And maybe some of those other devices, not so much. Again, just one poorly secured device in that mix could jeopardize your connected things, along with the data you keep on them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Privacy for smart appliances and smart devices counts too</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On the topic of data, we often talk about privacy policies and how they’re not all created equal. Depending on the app, device, and operating system—along with any settings you have control over too—may determine what information a company collects, keeps, and shares about you and your usage. Moreover, it may determine what they or other third parties might do with that data as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Put simply, not every company treats your personal data the same way. Some may sell it to data brokers for profit or share it with third parties like insurance companies, government agencies, law enforcement, and others according to </span><a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2020/five-common-privacy-problems-in-an-era-of-smart-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">findings published by some industry groups</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Still others may not sell that data, yet they will share it with third parties for analysis or use it to fuel their own advertising campaigns or advertising platforms they own. And of course, there are others who collect and analyze the bare minimum and keep that data to themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Consider once more that smart home filled with a dozen or so smart devices. That likely means several different data privacy policies are in play as well, each handing the data created by that home in different ways. And in ways that you may or may not be fully aware of, given that privacy policies are often notoriously long reads, sometimes filled with legalese. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Without question, privacy is another consideration for your smart home.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">You have more control over your smart home security and privacy than you might think</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can do plenty of things that can make your smart devices more private and more secure than they were when they came out of the box. And as mentioned above, the steps are all rather straightforward. Our Smart Home Security Guide lays it out for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s part of the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/resources/reports-and-guides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Security Guide Series</a>, and in it you’ll get a closer look at how you can protect a smart wall outlet, along with that smart coffeemaker, door lock, refrigerator and more. It covers the basics of protection, how to shop for more private and secure smart devices, plus a section that talks specifically about smart speakers and protecting your privacy while using them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, our Smart Home Security Guide is here to help. The truth is that security isn’t always included with smart home devices. Not right out of the box anyway. Just like with your computers, smartphones, and other devices, the best security relies on you. With a handful of steps, you can enjoy your smart home with confidence.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

You can also use your phone for browsing online, looking up everything from your favorite recipes to your most-read media </span><span data-contrast="auto">webpages</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While being able to browse whenever and wherever you want is convenient, you might prefer that your phone doesn’t save all your online searches. For example, if you frequently let other people use your phone, you may not want them to have access to a history of your Google searches. In this case, you can use </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/private-browsing-vs-vpn-which-one-is-more-private/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">private browsing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or &#8220;</span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto">.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This allows you to browse online without leaving any trace of your browsing activity on your mobile phone. Configuring your phone to use </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can give you greater confidence while surfing online, as you’ll enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your browser history isn’t recorded on your device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This article explains what </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is and how you can set it up on your mobile phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">What is I</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">ncognito Mode</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> allows you to browse online without leaving certain data on the device you’re using. Also referred to as </span><span data-contrast="auto">private browsing mode</span><span data-contrast="auto">, it makes sure there’s no record of your </span><span data-contrast="auto">search engine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> history, websites you visited, and even login details (and related passcodes) on that device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As soon as you close the incognito </span><span data-contrast="auto">web browser window</span><span data-contrast="auto">, any cookies are erased and all these details disappear instead of being saved.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That said, if you leave an incognito </span><span data-contrast="auto">browser window</span><span data-contrast="auto"> open on your phone — and then hand your phone to someone else — they’ll be able to see the activity. So, if you want to make the most of </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto">, make sure to close the </span><span data-contrast="auto">browser window</span><span data-contrast="auto"> after every surfing session. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Further, if you actively </span><span data-contrast="auto">bookmark</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a page, it will be saved — even if you’re in </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Read on for some more caveats surrounding </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and the extent of privacy it gives you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Is </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">incognito mode</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none"> really </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">private browsing</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">?</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s important to note that </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">private browsing mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is a </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">device</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">-specific privacy measure. It makes sure that your search and web </span><span data-contrast="auto">browsing history</span><span data-contrast="auto"> isn’t visible on the device itself. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, your traffic and activity are both still visible to third parties beyond your device, such as your network admin, </span><span data-contrast="auto">internet service provider</span><span data-contrast="auto"> (</span><span data-contrast="auto">ISP</span><span data-contrast="auto">), and the websites and </span><span data-contrast="auto">search engines</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that you visit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Viewing </span><span data-contrast="auto">in private</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also won’t disguise your unique IP address from these parties. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> further doesn’t secure your device against cyberthreats like hackers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That said, there are plenty of other tools you can use to safeguard your device against cybercriminals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> helps to secure your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Wi-Fi</span><span data-contrast="auto"> connection, shield you from malicious websites or links, and detect malware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Can I Get I</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">ncognito Mode</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> on my Phone?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You may already be familiar with </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through your computer. For example, many people set up </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through browsers like </span><span data-contrast="auto">Mozilla</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Firefox</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Google Chrome</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Safari</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Microsoft Edge</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or Internet Explorer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> isn’t just for computers — you can also use it on your phone’s web browsing apps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to turn on </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The steps to setting up </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> are fairly straightforward. That said, it depends largely on which type of device you have. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Again, remember to close your browser’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">private tabs</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when you’re done surfing. This makes sure that cookies are deleted and the private session is safely hidden from your device’s history.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Do certain apps offer </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The above steps can help you set up </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Apple</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">Android phone</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s browser. However, you probably use your phone for much more than browsing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You might have apps for watching videos, getting driving directions, listening to music, and more. And the tips above will only protect your privacy when using the phone’s browser — not apps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That said, some apps offer their very own in-app </span><span data-contrast="auto">incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Examples include YouTube, Google Maps, Spotify, and Instagram. Other apps simply offer the option of private sessions, requiring you to log in with a dedicated username and password if you’re going to use the app. These include Whatsapp, Dropbox, Amazon, PayPal, and Evernote. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some of these apps can even be configured so they’re only unlockable with touch ID or face ID.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Enhance Your Device’s Security</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Browsing in incognito or private mode on your phone allows you to surf online without leaving any trace of your </span><span data-contrast="auto">search history</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on that specific device. However, it doesn’t block third parties like your </span><span data-contrast="auto">internet service provider</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or network administrator from seeing what websites you’ve visited. Only your phone is affected.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Incognito mode</span><span data-contrast="auto"> also doesn’t protect you against potential cyberthreats, like malware.

Read more about Brenda’s McAfee’s journey, what a day in the McAfee sales team is like, and what her superpower is.</em>​​​​​​​</p>
<h2><strong>Embracing opportunities </strong></h2>
<p>When I started my professional career, I was in technology but one of the few women there at the time. A colleague encouraged me to join the Canadian Information Processing Society as a volunteer. I was just exploring, but it turned out to be a career-builder.</p>
<p>After some time, I joined the Society’s board – my first board appointment ever. Suddenly I was in a leadership position and people were looking to me to make decisions, especially the CIOs and other executives who were on the board with me. I embraced the opportunity, and the expectations they had of me shaped the professional I am today.</p>
<h2><strong>A day in the McAfee Sales team</strong></h2>
<p>I knew about McAfee from some people who had already worked there and was intrigued by the premise of protecting families online. This was a chance to do what I loved at a bigger scale. And after my interviews, I knew it was the right move!</p>
<p>I am part of the North American Sales team that acquires customers through partnerships with big box retailers throughout North America. Together with our partners, we help customers see the value of McAfee.</p>
<p>In sales, you are constantly interacting with people. Each day is different: one moment I’m planning with partners on how to jointly protect their customers and families online. The next, I’m working will McAfee colleagues on sales strategies and business planning. My days are a steady mix of conference and video calls to collaborate, plan, and connect.</p>
<p>Every day, I get to work with so many great people. On top of that, we’re using our powers for good! Everyone, partners and colleagues alike, are all inspired by our ultimate mission: to protect people and their families. I keep going back to the people – but what a fabulous community of colleagues and partners we work with globally​! I also love the birds-eye view I get across all McAfee’s business units. In order to make good on the promises we make to our partners, I collaborate every day with so many key stakeholders across our entire business.</p>
<p>And now that my children are adults, I&#8217;m finding more time for exercise, like Peloton or F45 cross fit. I&#8217;m also taking piano classes, and I just wrapped a one-night-a-week downhill skiing program with one of my daughters!</p>
<h2>​​​​​​​​​​​​​<strong>Flexibility, WISE and meeting global teams </strong></h2>
<p>McAfee lets you be flexible in getting your job done and taking on other projects. I am so grateful that I can help others through activities such as WISE (the McAfee Women In Security community). It’s important to do something outside of your day job because it makes your world bigger.</p>
<p>I work with some really great women on the WISE board. We are so supportive of each other. Board work is outside of our normal day jobs and sometimes we want to do things we haven’t done before. We put our heads together to figure it out quickly, divide up the work, and get it done!</p>
<p>I’ve also been very fortunate to be able to meet with many customers, partners, and colleagues face-to-face. This has allowed me to learn and grow, not only in my career but also in the Diversity and Inclusion space. The more you know about someone, the better partner and ally you can be.</p>
<h2>​​​​​​​​<strong>​​​​​​​My superpower </strong></h2>
<p>Over my career, I’ve built up my superpower: building relationships. I choose to be positive and empathetic, which helps me develop strong working relationships. I also keep in touch with people I’ve worked with over the years, whether they are peers, customers, or younger professionals I’ve mentored.</p>

Without having to tally totals at the table or fumble with crumpled bills, you and your companions can spend less stress and more time on the fun at hand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are various payment apps available, and the company that may first come to mind is PayPal. PayPal is regarded as a safe platform where security and strong encryption are a priority; however, a recent and advanced phishing scam is putting PayPal users at risk of giving up large sums of money and their personally identifiable information (PII).</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s look at this “triple-pronged” PayPal phishing scam and review some tips to help you identify and proceed should you encounter it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. The Email</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The typical part of this three-sided scam is the phishing email component. According to one source, the phishing email comes from a legitimate-looking PayPal service email address. Luckily, the typos, odd punctuation, extra spaces, and grammar errors in the body of the email give away that it is a phishing attempt. Remember, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/support/?locale=en-US&amp;articleId=TS101810&amp;page=shell&amp;shell=article-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing emails</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are often worded poorly or have errors. Large companies, especially ones like PayPal, have teams of content experts vetting all automated messages for such mistakes, so several mistakes in an email should set off your alarm bells. Proceed with caution and do not click on any links in the message.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The email also included wording that encouraged the user to act quickly or be charged a lot of money. That’s another trademark of phishing emails: urgency. Take a deep breath and make sure to reread carefully all emails that “require” a quick response. Don’t be scared by dire consequences. Phishers rely on people to rush and not give themselves time to listen to their better judgement.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. The ‘One-ring’ Phone Scam</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The PayPal phishing email included a support phone number that claimed it was toll free. In actuality, it was an international phone number. So, if the recipient of the phishing email didn’t quite believe the message but wanted to follow up, the scam could catch them with what’s called a one-ring phone scam.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> This occurs when someone unknowingly calls an international phone number and then gets charged by their phone company for the long-distance call.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The best way to avoid one-ring phone scams is to never call a number you don’t recognize. Always go to an organization’s official website to find their contact information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. The Fake Fraud Hotline</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The third dimension of this PayPal scam was the international phone number in the phishing email connected the caller directly with the scammer who posed as the PayPal fraud department. The “customer service representative” then asked prying personal and financial questions to glean enough PII to break into a PayPal account or compromise the caller’s identity. This is the most damaging part of the scam. An excellent customer support team may be able to reimburse you your lost money; however, once your personal details are in nefarious hands, you can’t take them back.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to never calling numbers you haven’t verified, never give out passwords and never give out more personal information than you need to. Even in legitimate customer service calls, it’s not rude to ask why the representative requires the information they’re asking for. In a fake call, questions like that may fluster the scammer, so keep an ear tuned to their tone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">For Peace of Mind, Partner With McAfee</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, our best advice for handling suspicious emails is to delete them. If it’s truly important, the sender will contact you again.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In short, the answer is “no.” Which is a good thing, as your name and address are in fact part of the public record. Anyone can get a hold of them. However, because they are public information, they are still tools that identity thieves can use.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you think of your identity as a jigsaw puzzle, your name and address are the first two pieces that they can use to build a bigger picture and ultimately put your identity at risk.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, let’s look at some other key pieces of your identity that are associated with your name and address—and what you can do to protect them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For starters, this information is so general that it is of little value in of itself to an identity thief. Yet a determined identity thief can do a bit of legwork and take a few extra steps to use them as a springboard for other scams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, with your name and address a thief could: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Research public databases for further pieces of information about you. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are volumes of public information that are readily available should someone want to add some more pieces to your identity jigsaw puzzle, such as: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., </span><a href="https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/public-records-archival-data/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the availability of such information will vary from state-to-state and different levels of government may have different regulations about what information gets filed—in addition to whether and how those reports are made public</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Globally, different nations and regions will collect varying amounts of public information and have their own regulations in place as well. More broadly, though, many of these public databases are now online. Consequently, accessing them is easier than the days when getting a hold of that information required an in-person visit a library or public office. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Get yet more personal information about you from online data brokers.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thieves can gain additional information about you from other online sources, such as data brokers. And data brokerage is a big business,</span> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global economy estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars a year</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. What fuels it? Personal information, representing thousands of </span><a href="https://sites.sanford.duke.edu/techpolicy/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/08/Data-Brokers-and-Sensitive-Data-on-US-Individuals-Sherman-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data points on billions of people</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> scraped </span><span data-contrast="none">from public records, social media, smartphone apps, shopper loyalty cards, third-party sources, and sometimes other data broker sites as well. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The above-the-board legal intent of data broker sites is to sell that information to advertisers so that they can create highly targeted campaigns based on people’s behaviors, travels, interests, and even political leanings. Others such as law enforcement officials, journalists, and others who are conducting background checks will use them too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the dark side, hackers, scammers, and thieves will buy this information as well, which they can use to commit identity theft and fraud. The thing is, data brokers will sell to anyone. They don’t discriminate. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Send you phishing attacks and scams by physical mail. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing attacks aren’t just for email, texts, and direct messages. </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-avoid-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">In fact, thieves are turning to old tricks via old-fashioned physical mail</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. That includes sending phony offers or by impersonating officials of government institutions, all designed to trick you into giving up your personally identifiable information (PII).  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What might that look like in your mailbox? They can take the form of bogus lottery prizes that request bank information for routing (non-existent) winnings. Another favorite of scammers are bogus tax notifications that demand immediate payment. In all, many can look quite convincing at first blush, yet there are ready ways you can spot them. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">many of the tips for avoiding these physical mail phishing attacks are the same for avoiding phishing attacks online, which we outline in detail here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Redirect your physical mail, essentially committing mail fraud. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Recently, I’ve seen a few </span><a href="https://www.whec.com/news/in-depth-mail-forwarding-scams-on-the-rise/6152637/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">news stories like this</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> where thieves reportedly abuse the change-of-address system with the U.S. Postal Service. Thieves will simply forward your mail to an address of their choosing, which can drop sensitive information like bank and credit card statements in their mailbox. From there, they could potentially have new checks sent to them or perhaps an additional credit card—both of which they can use to drain your accounts and run up your bills. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Postal Service has mechanisms in place to prevent this, however. Among which, the Postal Service will send you a physical piece of mail to confirm the forwarding. So, if you ever receive mail from the Postal Service, open it and give it a close look. If you get such a notice and didn’t order the forwarding, visit your local post office to get things straightened out. Likewise, if it seems like you’re missing bills in the mail, that’s another good reason to follow up with your post office and the business in question to see if there have been any changes made in your mail forwarding.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting your good name (and identity too) </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while your name and address are out there for practically all to see, they’re largely of little value to an identity thief on their own. But as mentioned above, they are key puzzle pieces to your overall identity. With enough of those other pieces in hand, that’s where an identity thief can cause trouble. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Other crucial pieces of your identity include:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your Social Security Number or tax ID number: </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with the biggest one. This is the master key to your identity, as it is one of the most unique identifiers you have. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/how-to-report-identity-theft-to-social-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">As I covered in my earlier blog on Social Security fraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a thief can unlock everything from credit history and credit line to tax refunds and medical care with your Social Security or tax ID number. In extreme cases, they can use it to impersonate you for employment, healthcare, and even in the event of an arrest.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can protect your Social Security Number by keeping it locked in a safe place (rather than in your wallet) and by providing your number only when absolutely necessary. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer-cyber-awareness/how-to-report-identity-theft-to-social-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">For more tips on keeping your number safe, drop by that blog on Social Security fraud I mentioned</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your passport and driver’s license: </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thieves have figured out ways of getting around the fact that IDs like these include a photo. They may be able to modify or emulate these documents “well enough” to pull off certain types of fraud, particularly if the people requesting their bogus documents don’t review them with a critical eye. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself in this case means knowing where these documents are at any time. (With passports, you may want to store those securely like your Social Security or tax ID number.) Also be careful when you share this information, as the identifiers on these documents are highly unique. If you’re uncomfortable with sharing this information, you can ask if other forms of ID might work—or if this information is really needed at all. Also, take a moment to make copies of these documents and store them in a secure place. This can help you provide important info to the proper authorities if they’re lost or stolen.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your card and account information: </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/data-breach-security-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With data breaches large and small making the news</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (and many more that do not), keeping a sharp eye on your accounts is a major part of identity theft prevention. We talk about this topic quite often, and it’s worth another mention because protecting these means protecting yourself from thieves who’re after direct access to your finances and more.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Secure your digital accounts for banking, credit cards, financials, and shopping by </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts that you change every 60 days</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Sound like a lot of work? </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Let a password manager do it for you, which you can find in comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. By changing your strong passwords and keeping them unique can help prevent you from becoming a victim if your account information is part of a breach—by the time a crook attempts to use it, you may have changed it and made it out of date. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Extra steps for extra identity protection  </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to protecting the core forms of identity mentioned above, a few other good habits go a long way toward keeping your identity secure. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Install and use online protection software</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By protecting your devices, you protect what’s on them, like your personal information. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software can protect your identity in several ways</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, like creating and managing the strong, unique passwords we talked about and providing further services that monitor and protect your identity—in addition to digital shredders that can permanently remove sensitive documents (simply deleting them won’t do that alone.) Further, it can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-monitoring/path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">monitor your identity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">monitor your credit</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, further protecting you from theft and fraud.</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Shred your stuff</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity theft where thieves dig through trash or go “dumpster diving” for literal scraps of personal info in bills and statements, has been an issue for some time. You can prevent it by shredding up any paper medical bills, tax documents, and checks once you’re through with them. Paper shredders are inexpensive, and let’s face it, kind of fun too. Also, if you’re traveling, have a trusted someone collects your mail or have the post office put a temporary hold on your mail. Thieves still poach mail from mailboxes too. </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Go paperless</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Getting statements online cuts the paper out of the equation and thus removes another thing that a thief can physically steal and possibly use against you. Whether you use electronic statements through your bank, credit card company, medical provider, or insurance company, use a secure password and a secure connection provided by a VPN. Both will make theft of your personal info far tougher on identity thieves. </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Use a VPN</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A VPN is a Virtual Private Network</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a service that protects your data and privacy online. It creates an encrypted tunnel to keep you more anonymous online by masking your IP address, device information, and the data you’re passing along that connection. In this way, it makes if far more difficult for advertisers, data brokers, and bad actors to skim your private information—in addition to shielding your information from crooks and snoops while you’re banking, shopping, or handling any kind of sensitive information online. </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Monitor your accounts</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Give your statements a close look each time they come around. While many companies and institutions have fraud detection mechanisms in place, they don’t always catch every instance of fraud. Look out for strange purchases or charges and follow up with your bank or credit card company if you suspect fraud. Even the smallest charge could be a sign that something shady is afoot. </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Check your credit report</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is a powerful tool for spotting identity theft. And in many cases, it’s free to do so. In the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">requires the major credit agencies to provide you with a free credit check</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> at least once every 12 months. </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/credit-reports-score/order-credit-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Canada provides this service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://moneyaware.co.uk/2017/05/how-to-get-your-credit-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the UK has options to receive free reports as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, along with several other nations. It’s a great idea to check your credit report, even if you don’t suspect a problem. </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Remove your personal data from data broker sites</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If the thought of your personal info being bought and sold puts you off, there’s something you can do about it. Our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> service can scan some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites, and with select products, it can even manage the removal for you. ​</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your name and address are just two pieces of a larger puzzle </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While thieves need more than just your name and address to commit the overwhelming majority of fraud, your name and address are centerpieces of the larger jigsaw puzzle that is your overall identity.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And the interesting thing is your puzzle gets larger and larger as time goes on. With each new account you create and service that you sign into, that’s one more piece added to the puzzle. Thieves love getting their hands on any pieces they can because with enough of them in place they can try and pull a fast one in your name. By looking after each piece and knowing what your larger jigsaw puzzle looks like, you can help keep identity thieves out of your business and your life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

No, we don’t mean apps of the mozzarella stick and potato skin variety, but your mobile apps that let you order dinner, hail a taxi, stay connected to your friends, and entertain you for hours with silly videos.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Did you know that there are hundreds of apps on the Android and Apple app stores whose only aim is to steal your passwords? In 2022, Meta identified more than 400 fake apps disguised as various utilities that targeted users to weasel Facebook login and password combinations.</span><span data-contrast="none">1</span><span data-contrast="none"> Malicious apps also regularly masquerade as photo editors and wallpapers but their real purpose is to run malware in the background of the mobile device, such as this </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/squid-game-app-or-mobile-malware-in-disguise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span data-contrast="none">Squid Game</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> app from 2021</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Little-known apps aren’t the only ones you have to be wary of either. The biggest companies are also falling to cybercrime. For instance, more details recently came to light about a breach at </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/57-million-users-compromised-in-uber-leak-protect-your-digital-privacy-and-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Uber that leaked the PII of 57 million users</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Plus, the popular mobile payment service, Cash App had the personal details of 8.3 million current and former users leaked.</span><span data-contrast="none">2</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">5 App Security Tips to Bring With You into 2023</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">To keep your cellphone free of malicious software and your PII and password secure, take these five mobile security tips with you into the new year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Delete old apps.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The new year is as good a time as any to unload any unnecessary baggage, emotional, literal, or in this case, digital. Go through your phone and delete the apps you haven’t used in the last six months. Make sure to completely delete your account with that app and not just hide it from your homepage. The smaller your digital footprint, the less at risk your PII is of being compromised in a breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Carefully vet new apps.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Before you download any new app, it’s a good idea to conduct some background research on it. How many detailed reviews does it have? Who is the app developer? A phony app usually reveals itself through its lack of reviews. Consider apps with less than 50 reviews fishy. Skim the reviews for specific details and typos. If it’s lacking in detail but brimming with typos and grammatical mistakes, it could signal a fake. This research should take about five minutes, so don’t worry; it shouldn’t be too much of an inconvenience, and that time will be well spent.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Stay on top of security news.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just like it’s a good idea to keep on top of global news, set up news alerts for cybersecurity breaches. If a company falls to a cybercriminal, the alert will give you the valuable time you need to act quickly to either delete your account or change your password.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Use unique passwords.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For every online account, it is essential to create a unique password or passphrase. That way, if you do get hacked through an app or get tricked by a fake one, you don’t have to worry about cybercriminals using that password to walk into your other accounts. Password managers are an excellent way to keep all your passwords secure and free up your brain space for things other than dozens of passwords.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5. Share as few personal details as possible.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When you sign up for a new app, you can expect to give it a username, a password, and maybe your first name; however, if it has optional fields for your full birthday or your address, consider leaving those blank. The less information the company has about you, the less that can end up in cybercriminals’ hands if the app is breached.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Enjoy Safe Mobile Apps in 2023</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The first step to better cyber habits is arming yourself with the knowledge of the threats that are out there. The best advice here is to slow down, observe and think about your next move every time you download a new app. The signs of a fake are usually not difficult to spot. Then, once you’re confident in its legitimacy, limit the amount of PII you share with it. In this digital world we live in, consider everyone susceptible to a breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">To give you peace of mind, supplement your great habits with a tool, like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, that will cover all your bases and be your partner to live your best private life online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">This year saw the continued evolution of scams, which is unlikely to slow down, as well as greater adoption of Chrome as an operating system. It also saw the introduction of AI tools that are easy and accessible to virtually anyone with a phone or laptop, which will continue to have significant implications, as will the fluctuating popularity of cryptocurrency and the emergence of “Web3.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Advances such as these have set the stage for 2023, which will continue to reshape our interactions with technology—advances that bad actors will try to exploit, and in turn, us. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet as the threat landscape continues to evolve, so do the ways we can protect ourselves. With that, we share McAfee’s threat predictions for 2023, along with insights and advice that can help us enjoy the advances to come with confidence.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">AI Goes Mainstream and the Distribution of Disinformation Rises</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By Steve Grobman, Chief Technology Officer</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Humans have been fascinated by artificial intelligence (AI) for almost as long as we’ve been using computers. And in some cases, even fearful of it. Depictions in pop culture range from HAL, the sentient computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Skynet, the self-aware neural network at the center of the Terminator franchise. The reality of current AI technologies is both more complicated and less autonomous than either of these. While AI is rapidly evolving, humans remain at the heart of it, and whether it’s put to beneficial or nefarious use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Within the last few months, creating AI-generated images, videos, and even voices are no longer strictly left to professionals. Now anyone with a phone or computer can take advantage of the technology using publicly available applications like Open AI’s </span><a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Dall-E</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or stability.ai’s </span><a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Stable Diffusion</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Google has even made </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">creating AI-generated videos</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> easier than ever.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What does this mean for the future?  It means the next generation of content creation is becoming available to the masses and will only continue to evolve. People both at work and at home will have the ability to create the AI-generated content in minutes. Just as desktop publishing, photo editing, and inexpensive photorealistic home printers created major advances that empowered individuals to create content that previously required a professional designer, these technologies will enable sophisticated outputs with minimal expertise or effort.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Advances in desktop publishing and consumer printing also provided benefits to criminals, enabling better counterfeiting and more realistic manipulation of images. Similarly, these emerging next-generation content tools will also be used by a range of bad actors. From cybercriminals to those seeking to falsely influence public opinion, these tools will empower scammers and propagandists to take their tradecraft to the next level with more realistic results and significantly improved efficiency. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is especially likely to ramp up in 2023 as the U.S. begins the 2024 presidential election cycle in earnest. Globally, the political environment is polarized. The confluence of the emergence of accessible next-generation generative AI tools and what is sure to be a highly contested 2024 election season is a perfect storm for creating and distributing disinformation for political and monetary gain. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’ll all need to be more mindful of the content we consume and the sources that it originates from. Fact-checking images, videos, and news content, something that’s already on the rise, will continue to be a necessary and valuable part of media consumption.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">New Year, New Scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By Oliver Devane, Security Researcher</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2022 we saw several online scams making use of existing content to make crypto scams more believable. One such example was the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/crypto-scammers-exploit-elon-musk-speaks-on-cryptocurrency"><span data-contrast="none">double your money cryptocurrency scam</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that used an old Elon Musk video as a lure. We expect such scams to evolve in 2023 and make use of deep fake videos, as well as audio, to trick victims into parting ways with their hard-earned money. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161610" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/crypto.png" alt="" width="602" height="337" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/crypto.png 602w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/crypto-300x168.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/crypto-205x115.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Investment scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The financial outlook of 2023 remains uncertain for many people. During these times, people often look for ways to make some extra money and this can lead them vulnerable to social media messages and online ads that offer huge financial gains for little investment.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the </span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">IC3 2021</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> report, the losses for financial scams increased from $336,469,000 in 2020 to $1,455,943,193 in 2021, this shows that this type of scam is growing by an enormous amount, and we expect this to continue.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Fake loans</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, scammers will often target the most vulnerable people. Fake loan scams are one such scam where the scammers know that the victims are desperate for the loan and therefore are less likely to react to warning signs such as asking for an upfront fee. McAfee predicts that there will be a large increase in these types of scams in 2023. When looking for a loan, always use a trusted provider and be careful of clicking on online ads. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Metaverse</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Metaverses such as Facebook&#8217;s Horizon enable their users to explore an online world that was previously unimaginable. When these platforms are in the early stages, malicious actors will usually attempt to exploit the lack of understanding of how they work and use this to scam people. We have observed phishing campaigns targeting users of these platforms in 2022 and we expect this to increase dramatically in 2023 as more and more users sign up for the platforms.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">The Rise of ChromeOS Threats</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">By Craig Schmugar, McAfee Senior Principal Engineer</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">More than 25 years ago, Windows 95 became the platform of choice not just for millions of users around the globe, but for malware authors targeting those users. Over the years, Windows has evolved, as has the threat landscape. Today, Windows 10 and 11 make up the majority of the desktop PC market, but thanks to the rise of the mobile Internet, device diversity has greatly evolved since the advent of Windows 95.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Over five years ago, </span><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/press/android-overtakes-windows-for-first-time"><span data-contrast="none">Android overtook Windows as the world&#8217;s most popular OS</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and with this shift bad actors have been pursing alternative methods of attack. The ultimate vectors are those which impact users across a spectrum of devices. Email and web-based scams (some of which are outlined in the blog above) are as prolific as ever as these technologies are ubiquitous across desktop and mobile devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meanwhile, other technologies span across desktop and mobile experiences as well. For Google, such cross-platform capabilities are highlighted by increased adoption of ChromeOS and a few underlying technologies. This includes 270 million active Android users and a 270% increase in Progressive Web Application (PWA) installations [</span><a href="https://chromeos.dev/"><span data-contrast="none">https://chromeos.dev</span></a><span data-contrast="none">].  ChromeOS’ ability to run Android applications, combined with its wide-spread adoption, provides the climate for increased attention by those with ill intentions.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Similarly, adoption of PWAs provide bad actors with additional incentive to deliver deceptive and imposter attacks through this multi-OS channel, including ChromeOS, iOS, MacOS, and Windows.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Finally, on the heels of COVID restrictions that impacted schools in various countries, Google reported 50 million students and educators worldwide [</span><a href="https://chromeos.dev/"><span data-contrast="none">https://chromeos.dev</span></a><span data-contrast="none">] using ChromeOS. Many users will be unaware of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/malicious-cookie-stuffing-chrome-extensions-with-1-4-million-users/"><span data-contrast="none">malicious Chrome extensions</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> lurking in the Chrome Web Store.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">All of this means that the stage is set for a marked increase in threats impacting Chromebook in the year to come. In 2023, we can expect to see Chromebook users among millions of unsuspecting victims that download and run malicious content, whether from malicious Android Apps, Progressive Web Apps, or Chrome Web Store extensions, users should be leery of popups and push notifications urging them to install untrusted apps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Web3 Threats will take advantage of FOMO</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">By Fernando Ruiz, Senior Security Researcher</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Editor’s Note: Web3? FOMO? If you’re already lost, you’re not alone. Web3 is a term some use to encompass decentralized internet services, technologies like Bitcoin and Non-Fungible Tokens (digital art that collectors can purchase with cryptocurrency). Still confused? A lot of people are. This New York Times article is a </span></i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/web3-definition-internet.html"><i><span data-contrast="none">good primer on what is currently considered Web3</span></i></a><i><span data-contrast="none">.  </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">As for FOMO, that’s just an acronym meaning the “Fear of Missing Out.” That nagging feeling, most often felt by extroverts, that others are out there having more fun than them and that they’re missing the party. </span></i></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Whether you invest in cryptocurrency or just see the headlines on Twitter, no doubt you’ve seen that the price of cryptocurrency has sharply declined during 2022. These fluctuations are becoming more normal as crypto becomes even more mainstream. It’s very likely that the value of crypto will rise again. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When the last upturn in valuation happened near the start of the pandemic, the hype about crypto also skyrocketed. Suddenly Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were everywhere. Out of that, rose the concept of Web3, with more companies investing in new applications over blockchain (the technology that is the backbone of cryptocurrency). </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">McAfee predicts that the popularity of cryptocurrency will rise again, and consumers will hear much more about Web3 concepts like </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/decentralized-finance-defi-transformative-potential-and-associated-risks.htm"><span data-contrast="none">decentralized finance</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (DeFi), </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/?sh=60e5e8e67305"><span data-contrast="none">decentralized autonomous organizations</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (DAOs), </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/category/trusted-identity/self-sovereign-identity/"><span data-contrast="none">self-sovereign identity</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (SSI) and more. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Some amateur investors, remembering the rapid rise of the value of Bitcoin earlier this decade, won’t want to miss out on what they think will be a great opportunity to get rich quick. It’s this group that bad actors will seek to exploit, offering up links or applications that play on these users’ crypto/Web3 FOMO. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As crypto bounces back and initial awareness of decentralization grows in the general population, consumers will begin to explore these Web3 offerings without fully understanding what they mean or what dangers they should be aware of, leaving them open to scams as they invest time and money into crypto or creating their own </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/12/what-is-an-nft?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ppccampaignID=17210591673&amp;ppcadID=&amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAvK2bBhB8EiwAZUbP1MTepNVXVvzw6wQebi8ogy02QVT1lnYOeE19MHzhoOwdfVA8LuWXwhoCD8oQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"><span data-contrast="none">NFT content</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, when consumers DO hold crypto, NFT, digital land, or other blockchain financial assets they are going to be targeted for more sophisticated threats that can drain their funds: smart contracts, exchanges, digital wallets, and synchronization services can all be associated with hidden authorizations that allow a third party (potentially a bad actor) to take control of the assets. It’s important that users read the terms and conditions of any app they download, especially those that will be accessing ANY type of financial institution or currency, whether traditional or crypto.</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Social engineering will also continue to be a top entry point for cybercriminals. The complexity of the attacks will evolve as the technology does, which will require more preparation and understanding of how Web3 applications and tools work in order to safely interact with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What has emerged from the world of Web3 thus far, while exciting, has also expanded attack surfaces and vectors, which we expect to see grow throughout 2023 as Web3 evolves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_121022.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_121022.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/300x203_Blog_121022-191x129.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Without doubt, the biggest criticism we all have of social media is that everyone always looks fabulous! And while we all know that everyone is only sharing the best version of themselves, let’s be honest &#8211; it can be a little wearing. Well, there’s a new social media platform that is determined to uproot our online curated lives by having users post very real pictures of themselves &#8211; with no time to stage or add filters!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Developed in France in 2020, </span><a href="https://bere.al/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">BeReal</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is where Aussie teenagers are currently spending their time and energy online. And to be honest, I can totally see why. It’s all about sharing random, authentic pics without having to spend time and energy making them look beautiful. In fact, my 19-year-old tells me that the uglier and weirder the photo, the better! How refreshing!!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Does It Work?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you’ve signed up, the app will send all users a notification at a random time throughout the day that it’s ‘time to BeReal’. As soon as the user opens the app to share a pic, they have just 2 minutes to take a picture of whatever they’re doing at that particular moment whether they’re on the bus, at the gym or chilling at home in trackies. The app will take 2 pictures using the front and back cameras so that your followers can see what you look like and where you are.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, if you don’t manage to post in 2 minutes, you’re officially late and your friends will know. In fact, there’s a small amount of shame for being tardy – as if on some level you’re not committed to being authentic. But don’t let this worry you too much – we can’t wait around all day awaiting the notification to post!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you have uploaded your daily snap, your friends can comment, respond to your pic with ‘RealMojis’ and even see where you are in the world with the map feature. Users can also choose to upload their pics to the public feed where other users can leave “RealMoji’ reactions but no comments. But in order to access either the public feed or your friends’ photos, users will need to take their own picture too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now for my favourite parts of this app – this app has NO filters, NO option to ‘like’ anything, NO follower counts and NO private messaging!! How liberating!! </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is It Safe?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like all social media platforms, there are a few risks however with a bit of strategy and a few smarts, users should be able to have a safe and positive experience. And when compared to platforms where follower counts and likes are public, influencers dominate and comments are allowed, BeReal is definitely a great choice. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here are my top tips to keep the experience safe and positive:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Disable Your Location To Avoid Being ‘Discoverable’</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before you share your pics, ensure you disable your location to avoid the app sharing your exact location on the map. You don’t want an ill-intentioned follower knowing your exact whereabouts!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Think (Quickly) Before You Post</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The very brief 2-minute posting window may result in rushed decisions about what to post and potentially oversharing of personal information. So, ensure you (and your kids) know not to share anything that can identify their location, any identifiable numbers such as passports or licences or, their computer screens that may display confidential information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Don’t Feel Pressures to Post If You Can’t </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Accept that there will be times when you just can’t post within the 2-minute time frame.  You may be driving, sleeping or doing something far more important. You can absolutely still post late.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Know How To Report Bad Behaviour</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you see a post that is inappropriate, then report it immediately. It’s an investment in keeping the BeReal community as safe as possible. Simply tap the three dots at the top right of the post. A report button should appear. You will then have the option to flag the post as undesirable or inappropriate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Be Aware of the Comparison Trap! </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like all social media platforms, users may compare their posts with others. They may think their lives are boring and predictable, particularly if their friends are doing more exciting things. If a young person is prone to anxiety or low mood, this may not be helpful. As a parent, reminding your kids that perception is not reality, and that one photo does not define a person may be required. But if it all gets too much, a digital detox might be just the thing! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if your kids have embraced BeReal then your homework is pretty easy – join up too! It’s impossible to understand your kids’ online world if you don’t take some time to step inside it. And for what it’s worth – I think you’ll really like this one. The fact that there is no public like count, follower tally, filters or private messaging makes the Mama Bear in me very happy!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

Holiday scams are a quick way to make a buck, and cybercriminals employ several holiday-themed schemes to weasel money and personally identifiable information (PII) from gift givers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here are three common holiday scams to watch out for this year, plus a few tips to help you </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">stay safe online</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Gift Card Cracking</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Gift cards are a standby present for the people on your list who are difficult to buy for or for people you don’t know too well but want to get them a small something. Whether the gift card is worth $5 or $500, an online scammer can steal the entire value through two techniques: a brute force attack or phishing. Known as gift card cracking, cybercriminals can take wild guesses at gift card codes and cash in the value for themselves by methodically guessing strings of numbers and letters and crossing their fingers for a match. Cybercriminals will also employ </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing emails</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, texts or social media direct messages to trick people into divulging gift card information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To avoid gift card cracking, encourage gift receivers to redeem their gift card quickly to shorten the amount of time a scammer has to guess the code correctly. Or, you could opt for a paper gift certificate from a small business that doesn’t require online redeeming at all. To avoid gift card phishing scams, do not engage with any type of correspondence that claims they can double the value of your gift card or claims that there’s a problem with it. Be instantly on alert if anyone asks for the activation code. If the gift card-issuing business really needs to replace your purchase, they’ll issue you a new code. They’ll never ask for your existing one.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Last-minute Shopping Scams</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Are you a procrastinator? Watch out for last-minute shopping scams that are targeted at people who leave their gift buying until deep in December. As with anything else, if it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Shopping scams often take the form of phishing emails where criminals impersonate a well-known merchant or shipping company. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While sales often have a quick timeline, don’t let that short timeline pressure you into making an impulsive decision. Phishers rely on people’s excitement or inattention to trick them into giving up their credit card or banking information. Phishing emails, when you take the time to inspect them, are usually easy to spot. The logos are often blurry, there are often typos and grammar mistakes, and the tone of the message will seem “off.” Either it will sound very formal and impersonalized or it will sound very informal and seem pushy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To protect your finances during the holiday season, consider putting a lock on your credit. This is easy to do with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/credit-lock-and-credit-freeze-which-service-is-best-for-you-both/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee credit lock</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. You can still use your credit card and shop as you normally would. A credit lock is useful because, in case a criminal gets ahold of your PII, they won’t be able to open lines of credit in your name. This protects your credit score, which is essential to keep in good standing if you hope to buy a house or take out a loan anytime soon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Social Media Ads and Fake Shopping Sites</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just because a “company” has an ad on Facebook or Instagram doesn’t mean that it’s a legitimate establishment. Before buying from an online store you’ve never heard of, do some background research on it and read customer reviews to make sure that it’s real and will deliver you a quality product. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Take note of the online store’s URL before entering it. (You can preview the link by hovering over it with your cursor.) If the URL is a string of letters and numbers, it could be a malware site in disguise. One way to alert you to suspicious sites is </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/web-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Web Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Web Protection color codes links to identify potential malware and phishing sites and alert you to steer clear.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your mind is already drawn in a bunch of different directions this holiday season (cooking, traveling, shopping, wrapping, tidying) so give yourself a respite from worrying about the safety of your identity and finances. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> includes a VPN, Web Protection, credit lock, antivirus and more to cover all your bases to keep your devices and your PII safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

In late September, we were all shaken when news of the biggest Australian data breach to date broke &#8211; a record 10 million Optus customers had their details stolen. But unfortunately, the data breach stories have continued with Medibank, Energy Australia, and, most recently, Woolworths also reporting that private customer data had been stolen.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Inevitably, many of us are feeling vulnerable worrying that our private identifying information (and our family’s) such as our Medicare and Drivers Licence details have potentially been stolen. We’ve all read the stories about victims of identity theft and are, rightly concerned, that it could happen to us. So, if you’re unsure as to what to do next &#8211; don’t worry – I’ve got you! In fact &#8211; I’m going to give you two action plans. The first is for those who have been personally affected by a data breach (or consider it highly likely they were affected) and the second, is a long-term plan to help you protect yourself and your family’s data online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What To Do If You’ve Been Affected By A Data Breach</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you or a family member has been contacted by a company and informed that your private details have been compromised, then you need to caffeine up and bring your entire focus to this situation. And if you’re still awaiting the call but you’re thinking it’s likely you’re affected, then my advice is to assume you are. It never hurts to be too cautious when you’re dealing with a potential identity theft situation. So, here’s your plan:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">If you think you’ve been affected, contact the company directly. Hopefully they can confirm whether you’re affected and identify what information was stolen eg drivers licence, birthdate, address, Medicare details.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">If your drivers licence, passport or Medicare details have been stolen, then you are able to apply for new documents. You may need to apply for a </span><a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/criminal-justice/cybercrime-identity-security/identity-protection-recovery"><span data-contrast="none">Commonwealth Victim’s Certificate</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> first. Do this as soon as possible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Contact your bank and credit card providers and inform them that you have been the victim of a data breach and ask them to monitor accounts for suspicious activity. Also ask them to put additional verification methods in place, particularly for over the phone authentication. You may also want to do this for your superannuation accounts, MyGov and Centrelink accounts too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Change your passwords for affected accounts immediately. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>

If you are unsure, contact the company directly to verify the communication.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Monitor your bank accounts daily for suspicious or any unexpected activity. Also check your telephone and utilities accounts. Contact your bank or provider if you notice anything that looks a little suspect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What To Do To Ensure Your Online Data Is As Secure As Possible</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, now it’s time to think long term. We all know prevention is key. So, what can we do to protect ourselves to minimise the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft (if and when) the next data breach occurs? Here’s your plan:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Refine Your Password Strategy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we all know, it’s often the simplest things that can have the biggest impact. Ensuring you have a different but super complex password or passphrase for each of your online accounts is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself online. I appreciate that this may take a lot of work to implement but it’s so worth it. And here’s why – if you’re the victim of a data breach and your login details are stolen then you could be in a world of pain if you have just one password for all your accounts. Because within seconds of stealing your details, a hacker could potentially access your bank accounts, credit card accounts and online shopping sites where your credit card is saved – you get the picture! You see why it makes such sense! If it all feels a little overwhelming, why not use a password manager? Password managers can create and remember passwords that no human could even think of – genius!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Use Multi-Factor Authentication When It’s Offered – Always!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In summary, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) makes a hacker’s life a lot harder. In short, it requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account or app. This might be a text, email or even a code generated by an authentication app. So, even if a hacker has your password and username, if they can’t access the last piece of the puzzle, then you’re safe!!!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Invest in A Top Tier Identity, Security and Protection Solution </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee has just released a super-duper solution to help Aussies protect themselves online. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is an all-in-one privacy, identity and device protection solution. Not only does it feature identity monitoring and a password manager but also an unlimited VPN, a file shredder, a protection score and parental controls. And the Rolls Royce version called McAfee+ Advanced, also offers subscribers additional identity protections including access to licensed restoration experts who can help you repair your identity and credit. It also gives subscribers access to lost wallet protection which help you cancel and replace your ID, credit cards if they are lost or stolen.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Do A Little Cyber-Hygiene! </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Limiting your exposure online will also reduce the chance of being affected by a data breach. So, take some time to delete accounts you no longer use. Perhaps you had a side hustle on eBay a few years back but hadn’t bothered to close your accounts &#8211; well, now is the time. Close down those old eBay (and PayPal) accounts and any other accounts or subscriptions that you no longer use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And next time you purchase something from a new website, consider conducting your transaction as a guest only and not creating an account on their website. If there’s no benefit beyond saving a minute or two when you check out, why store your credit card number, address, and other identifying info on a website that may eventually be breached?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If there is ever a time to take the management of your online data seriously, it’s now. Assuming that you won’t be a victim of a data breach and that ‘things like that don’t happen to you’ just doesn’t cut it. So, be proactive: sort out your passwords, turn on 2-factor authentication and practice some good quality cyber hygiene! And do yourself a favour and invest in some top-notch privacy and identity protection program like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> so you can continue living your best life online! </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/300x203_Blog_120122.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/300x203_Blog_120122.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/300x203_Blog_120122-191x129.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Even with the holidays in full swing, scammers won’t let up. In fact, it’s high time for some of their nastiest cons as</span><span data-contrast="none"> people travel, donate to charities, and simply try to enjoy their time with friends and family.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Unfortunate as it is, scammers see this time of year as a tremendous opportunity to profit. While people focus giving to others, they focus on taking, propping up all manner of scams that use the holidays as a disguise. So as people move quickly about their day, perhaps with a touch of holiday stress in the mix, they hope to catch people off their guard with scams that wrap themselves in holiday trappings.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet once you know what to look for, they’re relatively easy to spot. The same scams roll out every year, sometimes changing in appearance yet remaining the same in substance. With a sharp eye, you can steer clear of them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Watch out for these online scams this holiday season</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Shopping scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the books, we can look forward to what’s next—a wave of post-holiday sales events that will likewise draw in millions of online shoppers. And just like those other big shopping days, bad actors will roll out a host of scams aimed at unsuspecting shoppers. Shopping scams take on several forms, which makes this a topic unto itself, one that we cover thoroughly in our Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday shopping scams blog. It’s worth a read if you haven’t done so already, as digs into the details of these scams and shows how you can avoid them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, the high-level advice for avoiding shopping scams is this: keep your eyes open. Deals that look too good to be true likely are, and shopping with retailers you haven’t heard of before requires a little bit of research to determine if their track record is clean. In the U.S., you can turn to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for help </span><span data-contrast="auto">with </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a listing of retailers you can search</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> simply by typing in their names. You can also use </span><a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">https://whois.domaintools.com</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to look up the web address of the shopping site you want to research. There you can see its history and see when it was registered. A site that was registered only recently may be far less reputable than one that’s been registered for some time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Tech support scams </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Plenty of new tech makes its way into our homes during the holiday season. And some of that tech can be a little challenging to set up. Be careful when you search for help online. Many scammers will establish phony tech support sites that aim to steal funds and credit card information. Go directly to the product manufacturer for help. Often, manufacturers will offer free support as part of the product warranty, so if you see a site advertising support for a fee, that could be a sign of a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Likewise, scammers will reach out to you themselves. Whether through links from unsolicited emails, pop-up ads from risky sites, or by spammy phone calls, these scammers will pose as tech support from reputable brands. From there, they’ll falsely inform you that there’s something urgently wrong with your device and that you need to get it fixed </span><i><span data-contrast="none">right now</span></i><span data-contrast="none">—for a fee. Ignore these messages and don’t click on any links or attachments. Again, if you have concerns about your device, contact the manufacturer directly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Travel scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With the holidays comes travel, along with all the online booking and ticketing involved. Scammers will do their part to cash in here as well. Travel scams may include bogus emails that pose as reputable travel sites telling you something’s wrong with your booking. Clicking a link takes you to a similarly bogus site that asks for your credit card information to update the booking—which then passes it along to the scammer so they can rack up charges in your name. Other travel scams involve ads for cut-rate lodging, tours, airfare, and the like, all of which are served up on a phony website that only exists to steal credit card numbers and other personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Some of these scams can look quite genuine, even though they’re not. They’ll use cleverly disguised web addresses that look legitimate, but aren’t, so don’t click any links. If you receive notice about an issue with your holiday travel, contact the company directly to follow up. Also, be wary of ads with unusually deep discounts or that promise availability in an otherwise busy season or time. These could be scams, so stick with reputable booking sites or with the websites maintained by hotels and travel providers themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Fake charity scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Donations to an organization or cause that’s close to someone’s heart make for a great holiday gift, just as they offer you a way to give back during the holiday season. And you guessed it, scammers will take advantage of this too. They’ll set up phony charities and apply tactics that pressure you into giving. As with so many scams out there, any time an email, text, direct message, or site urges you into immediate action—take pause. Research the charity. See how long they’ve been in operation, how they put their funds to work, and who truly benefits from them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Likewise, note that there some charities pass along more money to their beneficiaries than others. As a general rule of thumb, most reputable organizations only keep 25% or less of their funds for operations, while some less-than-reputable organizations keep up to 95% of funds, leaving only 5% for advancing the cause they advocate. </span><span data-contrast="none">In the U.S., </span><a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/giving-charity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a site full of resources so that you can make your donation truly count</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Resources like </span><a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Charity Watch</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Charity Navigator</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, along with the </span><a href="https://www.give.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">BBB’s Wise Giving Alliance</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can also help you identify the best charities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5. Online betting scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The holidays also mean a flight of big-time sporting events, and with the advent of online betting in many regions scammers want to cash in. This scam works quite like shopping scams, where bad actors will set up online betting sites that look legitimate. They’ll take your bet, but if you win, they won’t pay out. Per the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB), the scam plays out like this:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“You place a bet, and, at first, everything seems normal. But as soon as you try to cash out your winnings, you find you can’t withdraw a cent. Scammers will make up various excuses. For example, they may claim technical issues or insist on additional identity verification. In other cases, they may require you to deposit even more money before you can withdraw your winnings. Whatever you do, you’ll never be able to get your money off the site. And any personal information you shared is now in the hands of scam artists.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can avoid these sites rather easily. Stick with the online betting sites that are approved by your regional gambling commission. Even so, be sure to read the fine print on any promo offers that these sites advertise because </span><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/consumer-alert-attorney-general-james-warns-new-yorkers-deceptive-online-sports#:~:text=Platforms%20reserve%20the,as%20a%20penalty." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">even legitimate betting sites can freeze accounts and the funds associated with them based on their terms and conditions</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Further protection from scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A complete suite of online protection software, such as McAfee+ Ultimate can offer layers of extra security</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition to more private and secure time online with a VPN, identity monitoring, and password management, it includes web browser protection that can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a phishing scam—which antivirus protection can’t do alone. Additionally, we offer $1M identity theft coverage and support from a recovery pro, just in case.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And because scammers use personal information such as email addresses and cell phone numbers to wage their attacks, other features like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">our </span></a> <span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup service can scan high-risk data broker sites for your personal information</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and then help you remove it, which can help reduce spam, phishing attacks, and deny bad actors the information they need to commit identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Scammers love a good thing—and will twist it for their own benefit.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s why they enjoy the holidays so much. With all our giving, travel, and charity in play, it’s prime time for their scams. Yet a little insight into their cons, along with some knowledge as to how they play out, you can avoid them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Remember that they’re playing into the hustle and bustle of the season and that they’re counting on you to lower your guard more than you might during other times of the year. Keep an eye open for the signs, do a little research when it’s called for, and stick with reputable stores, charities, and online services. With a thoughtful pause and a second look, you can spare yourself the grief of a scam and fully enjoy your holidays.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is an interesting point that the malware uses a reverse proxy to steal the user’s network and implement an Agent service with WAMP. McAfee Mobile Research Team will continue to find this kind of threat and protect our customers from mobile threats. It is recommended to be more careful when entering a password or confidential information into untrusted applications.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself from </span><span data-contrast="auto">tailgating attacks</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is partly a matter of learning about the issue, raising your level of awareness on the job, and depending on your employer, putting in place more effective security systems. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Increased security training</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many companies know how to train employees to recognize, avoid, and cope with online security issues but may forget to provide the same diligence to physical security.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Management should offer a clearly stated security policy taught to everyone, which might insist that no one be allowed into a secure area without the proper pass or identification.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">These </span><span data-contrast="auto">security measures</span><span data-contrast="auto"> should be part of an overall protection program, like<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs"> McAfee+</a></span><span data-contrast="auto">, which includes antivirus software, a firewall, identity monitoring, password management, web protection, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Are the results sparking an ember of unease in the back of your brain? Whether you’re a private person online or you’re comfortable sharing your daily life updates on social media, there are likely to be several personal details about you on sites that shouldn’t have that information. Some of these sites may be data brokerage websites. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Data brokerage sites are legal and are mostly used by annoying advertisers, though cybercriminals may also use them maliciously. The average person has their information for sale on 31 data brokerage sites, and 95% of people have their personal information on sale without their permission.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Make Your Attack Surface as Small as Possible</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Attack surface is a term usually applied to corporate security, but it’s a great visualization for everyday people going about their personal online errands and entertainment. An attack surface is the number of possible entry points a cybercriminal could weasel their way through to get at your valuable and private information. Entry points include your social media profiles, your online shopping accounts, and data brokerage sites. The fewer entry points you have, the harder it is for cybercriminals to find and exploit them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While Social Security Numbers (SSNs) are generally revered as the piece of PII to guard most closely, a cybercriminal can still damage your identity with just your name and an address, email address, or phone number. For example, they can request new passwords or multifactor authentication one-time passcodes to break their way into online banking or shopping accounts. Security breaches are happening to huge companies all over the world. All it takes is for your SSN to be leaked in one of them, for a cybercriminal to piece together your digital clone and use it to harm your identity or credit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Personal Data Cleanup minimizes your attack surface by removing as much PII as possible that’s floating around the internet, just waiting for someone to buy it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you’re aware of how many unauthorized vendors are selling your PII, it could be the wakeup call you need start adopting more cautious online habits. For instance, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-sharing-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">oversharing on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> leaks a lot of valuable details that a savvy criminal can then use to take educated guesses at your passwords or craft a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/its-social-media-day-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-from-social-engineering-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social engineering</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> plot catered just to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The present is as good a time as any to start protecting your identity for the future; however, getting started is often the most difficult step. It can seem overwhelming to </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/5-steps-to-removing-your-personal-information-from-the-internet/"><span data-contrast="none">reach out to every data brokerage site</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> individually and request they remove your info. Personal Data Cleanup can be your partner not only in beginning the cleanup process but in monitoring your data security to keep your online presence as minimal as possible. The service scans the internet’s riskiest sites and then, before deleting your information from these sites, runs it by you to confirm. Then, it will continually monitor those same sites, as your information will likely reappear every two to four months.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do not underestimate the tenacity of a cybercriminal. Even for people who have the attitude that their PII is bound to be somewhere online and that it’s no big deal, McAfee Personal Data Cleanup manages three key steps in the data removal process: scanning, removing, and monitoring. So, even if you’re not convinced that data brokerage sites are a threat, the process is too easy to put off any longer!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">What is antivirus? That’s a good question. What does it really protect? That’s an even better question.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Over the years, I’ve come to recognize that different people define antivirus differently. Some see it as way to keep hackers from crashing their computers. Others see it as a comprehensive set of protections. Neither definition is entirely on the money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With this blog, I hope to give everyone a clear definition of what antivirus does well, along with what it doesn’t do at all. The fact is that antivirus is just one form of online protection. There are other forms of protection as well, and understanding antivirus’ role in your overall mix of online protection is an important part of staying safer online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is antivirus?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Antivirus software protects your devices against malware and viruses through a combination of prevention, detection, and removal. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For years, people have installed antivirus software on their computers. Today, it can also protect your smartphones and tablets as well. In fact, we recommend installing it on those devices as well because they’re connected, just like a computer—and any device that connects to the internet is a potential target for malware and viruses. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In short, if it’s connected, it must get protected.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One important distinction about antivirus is its name, a name that first came into use decades ago when viruses first appeared on the scene. (More on that in a bit.) However, antivirus protects you from more than viruses. It protects against malware too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Malware is an umbrella term that covers all types of malicious software regardless of its design, intent, or how its delivered. Viruses are a subset of malicious software that infects devices and then replicates itself so that it can infect yet more devices.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So while we popularly refer to protection software as antivirus, it protects against far more than just viruses. It protects against malware overall.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Now here’s where some confusion may come in. Some antivirus apps are standalone. They offer malware protection and that’s it. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Other antivirus apps are part of comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, which can include several additional far-reaching features that can protect your privacy and your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The reason why antivirus gets paired up with other apps for your privacy and identity is because antivirus alone doesn’t offer these kinds of protections. Yet when paired with things like a password manager, credit monitoring, identity theft coverage, and a VPN, to name a few, you can protect your devices—along with your privacy and identity. All the things you need to stay safer online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In short, antivirus doesn’t cut it alone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that, let’s take a closer look at what malware and viruses really are—how they evolved, and what they look like today, along with how antivirus protects you against them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What was the first computer virus?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Viruses have a long history. And depending on how you define what a virus is, the first one arguably took root in 1971—more than 50 years ago. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It was known as </span><a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=2860"><span data-contrast="none">Creeper</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and rather than being malicious in nature, it was designed to show how a self-replicating program could identify other connected devices on a network, transfer itself to them, and find yet more devices to repeat the process. Later, the same programmer who created a follow-on version of Creeper developed Reaper, a program that could remove the Creeper program. In a way, Reaper could be considered the first piece of antivirus software.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">From there, it wasn’t until the 1980’s that malware started affecting the broader population, a time when computers became more commonplace in businesses and people’s homes. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">At first, malware typically spread by infected floppy disks, much like the “</span><a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=1676"><span data-contrast="none">Brain</span></a><span data-contrast="none">” virus in 1986. While recognized today as the first large-scale computer virus, its authors say they never intended it to work that way. Rather they say they created Brain as an anti-piracy measure to protect their proprietary software from theft. However, Brain got loose. It went beyond their software and affected computers worldwide. Although not malicious or destructive in nature, Brain most certainly put the industry, businesses, and consumers on notice. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Computer viruses became a thing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another piece of malware that got passed along via floppy disks was the “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/the-computer-virus-that-haunted-early-aids-researchers/481965/"><span data-contrast="none">PC Cyborg</span></a><span data-contrast="none">” attack that targeted the medical research community in and around 1989. There the malware would lie in wait until the user rebooted their computer for the 90</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none"> time.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Along with that note, PC Cyborg encrypted the computer’s files, which would only get unencrypted if the victim paid a fee—making PC Cyborg the first widely recognized form of ransomware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Shortly thereafter, the internet started connecting computers, which opened millions of doors for hackers as people went online. Among the most noteworthy was 1999’s “Melissa” virus, which spread by way of infected email attachments and overloaded hundreds of corporate and governmental email servers worldwide. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It was quickly followed in 2000 by what’s considered the among the most damaging malware to date—ILOVEYOU, which also spread by way of an attachment, this one posing as a love letter. Specifically, it was a self-replicating worm that installed itself on the victim’s computer where it destroyed some information and stole other information, then spread to other computers. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/04/this-20-year-old-virus-infected-50-million-windows-computers-in-10-days-why-the-iloveyou-pandemic-matters-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">One estimate puts the global cost of ILOVEYOU at $10 billion</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and further speculated that it infected 10% of the world’s internet-connected computers at the time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Today’s malware and viruses—even more malicious today</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With the advent of the internet, malware quickly established itself as a sad fact of connected life. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Today, McAfee registers an average of 1.1 million new malicious programs and potentially unwanted apps (PUA) each day, which contributes to the millions and millions of malicious programs already in existence. </span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Apart from the sheer volume of malware out there today, another thing that distinguishes today’s malware from early malware attacks—they’re created largely for profit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

If a hacker locks them up with a ransomware attack, you might find yourself wondering if you should take the risk of paying the ransom, even though payment is no assurance that you’ll get them back.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Today’s malware is far more than an annoyance or headache. It can lead to follow-on attacks that target your finances, your identity, your privacy, or a mix of all three.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">How does antivirus keep you safe? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So with a million or so new threats coming online each day, and millions more out there already, how does antivirus protect you from malware? It blocks, detects, and removes malware. And it does so in a couple of ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<li data-leveltext="%1)" data-font="Calibri" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1)&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><i><span data-contrast="auto">It protects you from entirely new threats</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> with technologies that can accurately detect those threats. Not to get overly technical about it, this entails a blend of deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) that spots new threats identifying sketchy behavior, such as abnormal demands and instructions. In short, the best antivirus today is </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">smart</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, as mentioned earlier, antivirus provides only one aspect of online protection today. While it protects your devices and the data that’s on them, your privacy and identity can come under attack as well. So while antivirus alone can protect you from malware, it can’t prevent other forms of online crime like identity theft, phishing attacks designed to steal personal information, or attacks on your accounts, to name a few of the many other types of threats out there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet comprehensive online protection can.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Antivirus, an essential part of your overall security mix</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>

If you&#8217;re not too interested in that particular result, you may simply move on to another result option. But if you&#8217;re tempted to visit the site anyway, you should be sure you understand what the warning means, what the risks are, and how to bypass the error if you need to.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">What does “this connection is not private” mean?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A “</span><span data-contrast="none">your connection is not private” error</span> <span data-contrast="none">means that your browser cannot determine with certainty that a website has safe encryption protocols in place to protect your device and data. You can bump into this error on any device connected to the internet — computer, smartphone, or tablet. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, what exactly is going on when you see the &#8220;this connection is not private” error? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For starters, it&#8217;s important to know that seeing the error is just a warning, and it does not mean any of your private information is compromised. A “</span><span data-contrast="none">your connection is not private</span><span data-contrast="none">” </span><span data-contrast="none">error means</span><span data-contrast="none"> the website you were trying to visit does not have an up-to-date SSL (</span><span data-contrast="none">secure sockets layer</span><span data-contrast="none">) </span><span data-contrast="none">security certificate</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Website owners</span><span data-contrast="none"> must maintain the licensing regularly to ensure the site encryption capabilities are up to date. If the </span><span data-contrast="none">website&#8217;s SSL certificate</span><span data-contrast="none"> is outdated, it means the site owners have not kept their encryption licensing current, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they are up to no good. Even major websites like </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/30/linkedin_ssl_certificates_expire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">LinkedIn</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> have had momentary lapses that would throw the error. LinkedIn mistakenly let their </span><span data-contrast="none">subdomain</span> <span data-contrast="none">SSL certificates</span><span data-contrast="none"> lapse. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In late 2021, a significant provider of </span><span data-contrast="none">SSL certificates</span><span data-contrast="none">, </span><span data-contrast="none">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</span><span data-contrast="none">, went out of business. When their root domain officially lapsed, it created issues for many </span><span data-contrast="none">domain names</span><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><span data-contrast="none">SSL certificates owned by </span><span data-contrast="none">legitimate companies. The </span><span data-contrast="none">privacy error</span><span data-contrast="none"> created problems for unwitting businesses, as many of their website visitors were rightfully concerned about site security. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While it does not always mean a website is unsafe to browse, it should not be ignored. A secure </span><span data-contrast="none">internet connection</span><span data-contrast="none"> is critical to protecting yourself online. Many nefarious websites are dangerous to visit, and this </span><span data-contrast="none">SSL certificate error</span><span data-contrast="none"> will protect you from walking into them unaware.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">SSL certification</span><span data-contrast="none"> standards have helped make the web a safer place to transact. It helps ensure online activities like paying bills online, ordering products, connecting to online banking, or keeping your private email accounts safe and secure. Online security continues to improve with a new Transport Layer Security (</span><span data-contrast="none">TLS</span><span data-contrast="none">) standard, which promises to be the successor protocol to SSL.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So be careful whenever visiting sites that trigger the &#8220;connection is not private&#8221; error, as those sites can potentially make your </span><span data-contrast="none">personal data</span><span data-contrast="none"> less secure and make your devices vulnerable to viruses and </span><span data-contrast="none">malware</span><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

In fact, some sites may contain malicious software (</span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto">) that can harm your computer or steal your personal </span><span data-contrast="auto">contact information</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">credit card</span><span data-contrast="auto"> numbers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is another common type of web-based attack where </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> try to trick you into giving them your personal information, and you can be susceptible to this if you visit a suspicious site. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Identity theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a serious problem, so it&#8217;s important to protect yourself when browsing the web. Online security threats can be a big issue for internet users, especially when visiting new websites or following site links.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So how can you tell if you’re visiting a </span><span data-contrast="auto">safe website</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or an </span><span data-contrast="auto">unsafe website</span><span data-contrast="auto">? You can use a few different methods. This page discusses key things to look for in a website so you can stay </span><span data-contrast="auto">safe online</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Key signs of </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">website safety</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> and security</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you’re visiting a website, a few key indicators can help determine whether the site is safe. This section explores how to check the URL for two specific signs of a </span><span data-contrast="auto">secure website</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">”Https:” in the website URL</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;Https&#8221; in a website URL indicates that the website is safe to visit. The &#8220;s&#8221; stands for “secure,” and it means that the website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect your information. A </span><span data-contrast="auto">verified</span> <span data-contrast="auto">SSL certificate</span><span data-contrast="auto"> tells your browser that the website is secure. This is especially important when </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/8-ways-to-know-if-online-stores-are-safe-and-legit/"><span data-contrast="none">shopping online</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or entering personal information into a website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you see &#8220;https&#8221; in a URL, the site is using a protocol that encrypts information before it&#8217;s sent from your computer to the website&#8217;s server. This helps prevent anyone from intercepting and reading your </span><span data-contrast="auto">sensitive information</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as it&#8217;s transmitted.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">A lock icon near your browser’s URL field</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The </span><span data-contrast="auto">padlock</span><span data-contrast="auto"> icon near your browser&#8217;s URL field is another indicator that a </span><span data-contrast="auto">webpage</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is safe to visit. This icon usually appears in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">address bar</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and means the site uses SSL encryption. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Security tools</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and icon and warning appearances depend on the </span><span data-contrast="auto">web browser</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Use McAfee WebAdvisor</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee WebAdvisor</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a free toolbar that helps keep you </span><span data-contrast="auto">safe online</span><span data-contrast="auto">.

In addition, it can help you avoid online </span><span data-contrast="auto">scams</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and prevent you from accidentally downloading </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Overall, McAfee WebAdvisor is a useful tool that can help you stay safe while browsing the web.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Website trust seals</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you&#8217;re browsing the web, it&#8217;s important to be able to trust the websites you&#8217;re visiting. One way to determine if a website is trustworthy is to look for trust seals. Trust seals are logos or badges that indicate a website is safe and secure. They usually appear on the homepage or checkout page of a website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are many types of trust seals, but some of the most common include the Better Business Bureau (BBB) seal, VeriSign secure seal, and the McAfee secure seal. These seals indicate that a third-party organization has </span><span data-contrast="auto">verified</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the website as safe and secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While trust seals can help determine whether a website is trustworthy, it&#8217;s important to remember that they are not foolproof. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Website owners</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can create a fake trust seal, so it&#8217;s always important to do your own research to ensure a website is safe before entering personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Check for a privacy policy</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way to determine if a website is safe to visit is to check for a privacy policy. A privacy policy is a document that outlines how a website collects and uses personal information. It should also state how the site protects your data from being accessed or shared by </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-recognize-an-online-scammer/"><span data-contrast="none">scammers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">hackers</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or other unauthorized individuals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If a website doesn&#8217;t have a privacy policy, that&#8217;s a red flag that you shouldn&#8217;t enter any personal information on the site. Even if a website does have a privacy policy, it&#8217;s important to read it carefully so you understand how the site uses your </span><span data-contrast="auto">personal data</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Check third-party reviews</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It&#8217;s important to do some preliminary research before visiting a new website, especially if you&#8217;re </span><span data-contrast="auto">shopping online</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or entering </span><span data-contrast="auto">personal data</span><span data-contrast="auto"> like your address, </span><span data-contrast="auto">credit card</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or </span><span data-contrast="auto">phone number</span><span data-contrast="auto">. One way to determine if a website is safe and trustworthy is to check third-party reviews. Several websites provide reviews of other websites, so you should be able to find several reviews for any given site.</span><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/"><span data-contrast="none"> </span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/"><span data-contrast="none">Trustpilot</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is one example of a website that provides reviews of other websites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Look for common themes when reading reviews. If most of the reviews mention that a website is safe and easy to use, it&#8217;s likely that the site is indeed safe to visit. However, if a lot of negative reviews mention problems with viruses or </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto">, you might want to avoid the site.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Look over the website design</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can also analyze the website design when deciding whether a website is safe to visit. Look for spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and anything that appears off. If a website looks like it was made in a hurry or doesn&#8217;t seem to be well-designed, that&#8217;s usually a red flag that the site might not be safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be especially careful of websites that have a lot of </span><span data-contrast="auto">pop-ups</span><span data-contrast="auto">. These sites are often spammy or contain </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Don&#8217;t download anything from a website unless you&#8217;re absolutely sure it&#8217;s safe. These </span><span data-contrast="auto">malicious websites</span><span data-contrast="auto"> rarely show up on the top of </span><span data-contrast="auto">search engine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> results, so consider using a </span><span data-contrast="auto">search engine</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to find what you&#8217;re looking for rather than a link that </span><span data-contrast="auto">redirects</span><span data-contrast="auto"> you to an unknown website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Download McAfee WebAdvisor for free and stay safe while browsing</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you&#8217;re unsure whether a website is safe to visit, download McAfee WebAdvisor for free. McAfee WebAdvisor is a program that helps protect you from online threats, such as </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and viruses.

The World Cup is on its way to television screens around the world, and scores of fans are dreaming of cheering on their team at stadiums throughout Qatar. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are dreaming of stealing the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (PII) of fans seeking last-minute vacation and ticket deals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Don’t let the threat of phishers and online scammers dampen your team spirit this World Cup tournament. Here are three common schemes cybercriminals will likely employ and a few tips to help you dribble around their clumsy offense and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">protect your identity</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, financial information, and digital privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Fake Contests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Phishers will be out in full force attempting to capitalize on World Cup fever. People wrapped up in the excitement may jump on offers that any other time of the year they would treat with skepticism. For example, in years past, fake contests and travel deals inundated email inboxes across the world. Some companies do indeed run legitimate giveaways, and cybercriminals slip in their phishing attempts among them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you receive an email or text saying that you’re the winner of a ticket giveaway, think back: Did you even enter a contest? If not, treat any “winner” notification with skepticism. It’s very rare for a company to automatically enter people into a drawing. Usually, companies want you to act – subscribe to a newsletter or engage with a social media post, for example – in exchange for your entry into their contest. Also, beware of emails that urge you to respond within a few hours to “claim your prize.” While it’s true that real contest winners must reply promptly, organized companies will likely give you at least a day if not longer to acknowledge receipt.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Travel Scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Traveling is rarely an inexpensive endeavor. Flights, hotels, rental cars, dining costs, and tourist attraction admission fees add up quickly. In the case of this year’s host country, Qatar, there’s an additional cost for American travelers: visas. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you see package travel deals to the World Cup that seem too good to pass up … pass them up. Fake ads for ultra-cheap flights, hotels, and tickets may appear not only in your email inbox but also on your social media feed. Just because it’s an ad doesn’t mean it comes from a legitimate company. Legitimate travel companies will likely have professional-looking websites with clear graphics and clean website copy. Search for the name of the organization online and see what other people have to say about the company. If no search results appear or the website looks sloppy, proceed with caution or do not approach at all.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Regarding visas, be wary of anyone offering to help you apply for a visa. There are plenty of government-run websites that’ll walk you through the process, which isn’t difficult as long as you leave enough time for processing. Do not send your physical passport to anyone who is not a confirmed government official.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Malicious Streaming Sites</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Even fans who’ve given up on watching World Cup matches in person aren’t out of the path of scams. Sites claiming to have crystal clear streams of every game could be malware spreaders in disguise. Malware and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/ransomware-masquerading-as-microsoft-update-targets-home-computers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">ransomware targeting home computers</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> often lurk on sketchy sites. All it takes is a click on one bad link to let a cybercriminal or a virus into your device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Your safest route to good-quality live game streams is through the official sites of your local broadcasting company or the official World Cup site. You may have to pay a fee, but in the grand scheme of things, that fee could be a lot less expensive than replacing or repairing an infected device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Shore Up Your Defense With McAfee+</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Here&#8217;s an excellent rule to follow with any electronic correspondence: Never send anyone your passwords, routing and account number, passport information, or Social Security Number. A legitimate organization will never ask for your password, and it’s best to communicate any sensitive financial or identifiable information over the phone, not email or text as they can easily fall into the wrong hands. Also, do not wire large sums of money to someone you just met online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Don’t let scams ruin your enjoyment of this year’s World Cup! With these tips, you should be able to avoid the most common schemes but to boost your confidence in your online presence, consider signing up for </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee</span></a><span data-contrast="none">+</span><span data-contrast="none">. Think of McAfee+ as the ultimate goalkeeper who’ll block any cybercriminals looking to score on you. With identity monitoring, credit lock, unlimited VPN and antivirus, and more, you can surf safely and with peace of mind. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

With the way scammers and thieves target people today, you need to protect yourself too—specifically your identity and privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Threats have evolved over the years. While hackers still wage malware attacks on computers, tablets, and smartphones, the devices aren’t the ultimate target. You are. The personal and private information created and kept on your devices have tremendous value because scammers and thieves can use it to steal your identity, open credit cards in your name, and commit all kinds of identity theft and fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet just as using antivirus protection can keep you safer online, using privacy and identity protection will keep you far safer still. Let’s look at how all three can work in concert.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Privacy protection </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Privacy protection focuses on keeping your information from getting into the hands of advertisers, cybercriminals, and data brokers who want to use it for their benefit. To boost your online privacy, consider a few thoughtful additions to your daily browsing, email, and social media routine.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First, think carefully about your social media habits. Do you post everything about your day and childhood, pin your location, and share photos of documents that include your full name, birthday, or address? You may want to consider cutting back on what you broadcast on the internet, especially if your account is public for anyone to view. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, while your friends and family may love your status updates, cybercriminals love them more. After only minutes of snooping, cybercriminals can glean enough personal details about you to impersonate you or target a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/social-engineering-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social engineering</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> attempt at you. To keep your private information more private, limit what you share on social media, pare down your follower and friend lists to only the closest people, and if your social media account platform supports it set your account to private. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One more way to protect your privacy is to use a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">virtual private network (VPN)</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. A VPN allows you to remain far more anonymous online by shielding your location and device information, along with the data passing along your connection—which includes things like your passwords, account information, and other sensitive info.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A VPN offers further protection when you’re logged on to a public network, like those in coffee shops, libraries, and transportation hubs. Cybercriminals often lurk on non-password-protected Wi-Fi networks and eavesdrop on people paying bills or online shopping to steal their credentials. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, criminals aren’t the only ones who intrude on your privacy. Online data brokers collect thousands of data points on millions of people, then post bits of that information for anyone to see and offer far more detailed information for a price. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Who buys this information? More legitimate purposes include people conducting background checks, journalists, law enforcement, and, largely, advertisers. With such in-depth information, advertisers can target highly specific audiences with their ads, all based on personal information that can include shopping habits from customer loyalty cards, health data from fitness apps, and information scraped from public social media posts—just to name a few of the umpteen sources they draw from.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet data brokers won’t discriminate. They’ll sell to scammers and thieves as well, who can then use that personal information to help them commit identity fraud and theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, you can do something about this. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal data cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can scan some of the riskiest data broker sites and show you which ones are selling your personal info. It can also provide guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and can even manage the removal for you. And because data brokers continually update their data, personal data cleanup will continue to monitor those sites and help you get your information removed should it crop up again.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, if you feel that your privacy shouldn’t be up for grabs, a personal data cleanup service can help.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Identity protection </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another form of protection focuses on keeping you safer from </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/whats-the-difference-between-identity-fraud-and-identity-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft and fraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Here, thieves will steal personal and account information to rack up charges on existing credit and debit cards, open entirely new accounts and lines of credit, or impersonating the victim themselves for employment, health insurance coverage, or to commit other crimes in someone else’s name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few forms of identity crime include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to keep your identity secure is to guard your PII carefully. Never give out your Social Security Number unless it’s necessary—such for employment, opening bank and credit accounts, applying for public assistance, filing tax returns, or obtaining a driver’s license. While other businesses may ask you for your Social Security Number for identification purposes, you are not legally bound to provide it. You can ask to provide an alternate form. Also, never share it over email or text where it can be potentially intercepted. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Beyond your Social Security Number, you can take steps to protect the many other forms of personal information you have. An </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-monitoring/path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can keep tabs on everything from email addresses to IDs and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft.​ Likewise, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/credit-monitoring?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">credit monitoring</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can watch for unusual credit activity that could be an indicator of identity theft as well</span><span data-contrast="auto">. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Should the unfortunate occur, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-theft-coverage?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft &amp; recovery coverage</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> like ours can help you get back on track in several ways. First, it provides $1 million in identity theft coverage that covers travel expenses, legal fees, and stolen funds reimbursement. Additionally, it provides the assistance of a licensed identity theft recovery pro who can help you repair your identity and credit. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Device security </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The third form of protection involves our devices, like computers, tablets, and phones—protecting them from both physical and digital threats.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first step you can take is to use a password, PIN, facial recognition, or other form of lock to keep your devices safer in the event of loss or theft. With this protection, your device is effectively an open book, providing a thief with access to all manner of personal information, accounts, and apps.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taking this protection a step further is learning to remotely locate your devices and then lock or wipe them. Many laptops and mobile devices offer location tracking services to help find a lost device—and yet others allow the owner to remotely lock or even wipe the contents of that device if they fear it’s lost for good or fallen into the wrong hands. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s all rather straightforward, and device manufacturers have put up helpful web pages that can walk you through the process: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another good step you can take is to back up your files, whether with an online cloud service, a physical external drive, or both. By storing your files in the cloud, you can recover them quickly if your device is stolen and you have to remotely wipe its contents. Storing them on an external drive also lets you recover your files if your device is stolen, however, you’ll want to keep it in a secure location so that it can’t be stolen as well. Options include a fireproof safe where you keep other valuables or even a safe deposit box. The drawback is that you will have to back up files manually and regularly whereas cloud backup is practically automatic when you’re connected to the internet.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another component of device security is defending against malicious software. Viruses and malware can make their way onto your devices through several avenues, including sketchy websites, dishonest downloads, phishing schemes, and clicking on ads. The challenge is that several of these avenues can look rather legitimate at first glance. Sophisticated hackers, scammers, and thieves have learned how to make their bogus websites and search results look like the real thing. One way you can prevent making a bad click or downloading an attachment loaded with malware is to use </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">web advisor software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that can protect you while you browse.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And finally, yes, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">antivirus</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a must now just as it’s ever been. When kept up to date with the latest updates, it can prevent malware from getting onto your devices—plus scan, detect, and delete viruses and malware from your devices should they make their way onto them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting your privacy, identity, and devices—today calls for all three</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threats out there are many, and they go beyond threats to your devices. Hackers, scammers, and thieves are quite interested in you. Your accounts, your personal information, and anything they can grab to commit theft or fraud. Protecting yourself today calls for not only protecting your devices but your privacy and identity too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> like ours covers all three—privacy, identity, and devices. It includes the protections mentioned above, plus dozens of features more such as ransomware coverage, credit freezes, security locks, and an online protection score that shows you just how safe you are, along with suggestions that can make you safer still. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In all, it gives you far more control over your privacy and personal information, control that should rest in your hands, and not in the hands of data brokers, hackers, scammers, and thieves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Stay Safe on Unsecure Networks</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The most widely known benefit of a VPN for daily use is to safeguard your device when it’s connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Coffee shops, libraries, hotels, transportation hubs, and other public places often provide courtesy internet service to visitors. Shifty characters often lurk on unprotected networks to lift </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> (PII) from people handling sensitive emails, making banking transactions, or shopping online. Public Wi-Fi eavesdroppers can lift credit card numbers, addresses, birthdays, and Social Insurance Numbers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When you connect to public Wi-Fi that doesn’t have a lock icon, that’s a sign that you should toggle on your VPN. Also, even if you’re required to enter a password, be wary of any network you share with strangers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Hide Location Data</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A VPN can also hide your location data. How does this help you protect your browsing history? First, when you scramble your location, you’re likely to confuse ad networks trying to send you targeted ads. This will free your social media feeds and search engines from targeted ads that often are so accurate they seem like an invasion of privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Second, hiding your location can protect you from cybercriminals looking to mine PII. VPNs make it impossible for criminals to discover your IP address. (The internet protocol address is what ties your device to a specific local network.) When they’re visible, criminals can trace IP addresses to reveal home addresses, full names, and phone numbers: all of which are key pieces of PII that, in the wrong hands, can jeopardize your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Restrict <span class="TextRun SCXW26593298 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart SCXW26593298 BCX0">Data Snooping and Sharing</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW26593298 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While Canada and the European Union don’t allow ISPs (internet service providers) to even collect the browsing data of their customers, keep in mind that in some countries, like the U.S., ISPs can collect, store, share, and/or sell customer data. While advertisers are often the buyers of customer data, in the case of a breach, the more places your PII lives, the more likely it may be involved in a security incident. The goal is to limit the extent and number of places where your browsing history is stored.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">VPNs can scramble your online movements to the point where not even ISPs can track it. Plus, when you log out, your device doesn’t keep a record of what you did while connected to the VPN. Incognito mode on your internet browser hides your IP address, but the websites you visit still collect cookies and store data about your online whereabouts, meaning that it’s not truly private browsing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A man-in-the-middle attack, or MiTM attack, is a scheme where a cybercriminal intercepts someone’s online activity and impersonates a trusted person or organization. From there, the criminal may ask personal questions or attempt to get financial information; however, since the mobile device owner thinks they’re communicating with someone with good intentions, they give up these details freely.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">MiTM is an umbrella term that includes several cybercrime tactics, such as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

(An IP address is the unique code assigned to each device that connects to the internet.) For example, the criminal may eavesdrop on a conversation between a bank representative and a customer. The criminal will pretend to be either party, gaining confidential financial information or giving incorrect banking details to receive wire transfers to their own bank account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The most common giveaway of a MiTM attack is a spotty internet connection. If a cybercriminal has a hold on your device, they may disconnect you from the internet so they can take your place in sessions or steal your username and password combination.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your device is overheating or the battery life is much shorter than normal, it could indicate that it is running malware in the background.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you can identify the signs of a MiTM attack, that’s a great first step in protecting your device. Awareness of your digital surroundings is another way to keep your device and PII safe. Steer clear of websites that look sloppy, and do not stream or download content from unofficial sites. Malware is often hidden in links on dubious sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To safeguard your Wi-Fi connection, protect your home router with a strong password or passphrase. When connecting to public Wi-Fi, confirm with the hotel or café&#8217;s staff their official Wi-Fi network name. Then, make sure to connect to a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your online activity, which makes it impossible for someone to digitally eavesdrop.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, a comprehensive antivirus software can clean up your device of malicious programs it might have contracted.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

It also includes web protection that alerts you to suspicious websites, identity monitoring, and daily credit reports to help you browse safely and keep on top of any threats to your identity or credit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A cybercriminal’s prize for winning a mobile scheme of monkey in the middle is your personal information. With preparation and excellent digital protection tools on your team, you can make sure you emerge victorious and safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161629" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chrome-v-edge.png" alt="" width="624" height="491" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chrome-v-edge.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chrome-v-edge-300x236.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chrome-v-edge-164x129.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Such browser-delivered push messages appear as toaster pop-ups in the tray above the system clock and are meant to trick users into taking various actions, such as installing software, purchasing a subscription, or providing personal information.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161671" style="width: 390px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-161671" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/example-of-a-deceptive-push-notification.png" alt="example of a deceptive push notification" width="390" height="440" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/example-of-a-deceptive-push-notification.png 390w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/example-of-a-deceptive-push-notification-266x300.png 266w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/example-of-a-deceptive-push-notification-114x129.png 114w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-161671" class="wp-caption-text">example of a deceptive push notification</figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon further investigation, this major drop seems to be associated with a change in the behavior of the Edge browser with two notable improvements over older versions.</p>
<p>First, when users visit websites known to deliver deceptive push notifications, Edge blocks authorization prompts that could trick users into opting-in to receive popups:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161657" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pop-ups.png" alt="" width="624" height="181" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pop-ups.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pop-ups-300x87.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pop-ups-205x59.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>Second, when unwanted popups do occur, it is now easier than ever to disable them, on a per-site basis.  Users can simply click the three dots (…) on the right of the notification and choose to “Turn off all notifications for” the domain responsible for the popup.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161643" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/msft-edge.png" alt="" width="468" height="363" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/msft-edge.png 468w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/msft-edge-300x233.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/msft-edge-166x129.png 166w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></p>
<p>This is a great improvement over the previous experience of having to manually navigate browser settings to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, 9TO5Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/06/01/chrome-block-notifications-disruptive-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a Chrome code change may be indicative of a similar crack down by Google on nefarious popups.</p>
<p>One can hope Google will follow Microsoft’s example to improve browser security and usability.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The records were stolen in </span><a href="https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/702328/health-insurer-medibank-hit-by-cyber-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">October’s reported breach</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> at Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurance providers.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/medibank/status/1590164893998936064" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">According to Medibank</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, the records and information could include diagnoses, a list of conditions, and further information such as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">“[P]ersonal data such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, Medicare numbers for AHM customers (not expiry dates), in some cases passport numbers for our international students (not expiry dates), and some health claims data.”</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:1440,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Any time a data breach occurs, it means that your personal information could end up in the hands of a bad actor. In the case of Medibank, the hackers posted the stolen information on the dark web, which unfortunately means that the likelihood </span><span data-contrast="auto">of a </span><span data-contrast="none">potential scammer or thief obtaining this information is a near certainty.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In light of this, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself in the aftermath of a data breach, which involves a combination of preventative steps and some monitoring on your part.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Report unauthorised use of your information or accounts immediately</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil called for Australians to “Contact Services Australia if you believe there has been unauthorised activity in your Medicare account.” Further, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/support/?articleId=TS103163&amp;page=shell&amp;shell=article-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Australians can take the following additional steps to protect themselves in the wake of identity theft</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Keep an eye out for phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With some personal information in hand, bad actors may seek out more. They may follow up a breach with rounds of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing attacks</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that direct you to bogus sites designed to steal your personal information—either by tricking you into providing it or by stealing it without your knowledge. So </span><span data-contrast="none">as</span><span data-contrast="none"> it’s always wise to keep a skeptical eye open for unsolicited messages that ask you for information in some form or other, often in ways that urge or pressure you into acting. Always look out for phishing attacks, particularly after breaches.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you are contacted by Medibank, make certain the communication is legitimate. Bad actors may pose as Medibank to steal personal information. Do not click on links sent in emails, texts, or messages. Instead, go straight to the Medibank website or contact them by phone directly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Change your passwords and use a password manager</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While it does not appear that login information was affected, a password update is still a strong security move. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Strong and unique passwords are best</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, which means never reusing your passwords across different sites and platforms. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Using a password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> will help you keep on top of it all, while also storing your passwords securely.</span><span data-contrast="none"> Moreover, changing your passwords regularly can reduce your risk in the event of a data breach. Namely, a breached password is no good to a hacker if you’ve changed it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Enable two-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">While a strong and unique password is a good first line of defense, enabling two-factor authentication across your accounts will help your cause by providing an added layer of security. It’s increasingly common to see nowadays, where banks and all manner of online services will only allow access to your accounts after you’ve provided a one-time passcode sent to your email or smartphone. If your accounts support two-factor authentication, enable it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Consider using identity monitoring</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">An identity monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> can monitor everything from email addresses to credit cards, bank account numbers and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft. Personal information harvested from data breaches can end up on dark web marketplaces where it’s bought by other bad actors so they can launch their own attacks. McAfee’s identity monitoring service helps you keep an eye on your personal info and provides alerts if your data is found, averaging 10 months ahead of similar services.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Check your credit and consider a credit freeze</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When personal information gets released, there’s a chance that a hacker, scammer, or thief will put it to use. This may include committing fraud, where they draw funds from existing accounts, and theft, where they create new accounts in </span><span data-contrast="auto">your </span><span data-contrast="none">name. This may include identity theft, where someone pretends to be you, generally to gain access to more information or services, and may escalate to identity fraud, where funds are stolen from your account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another step that customers can take is to place a credit freeze on their credit reports with the major credit agencies in Australia— Equifax, illion, and Experian. This will help prevent bad actors from opening new lines of credit or take out loans in your name by “freezing” your credit report so that potential creditors cannot pull it for reference. Terms of freezing a credit report will vary, so check with each agency for details.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Consider using comprehensive online protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">complete suite of online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can offer layers of extra security</span><span data-contrast="none">. Identity thieves generally focus on easy targets to save time. Elevated security across the majority of your data can make you a far more difficult target. In addition to more private and secure time online with a VPN, identity monitoring, and password management, this includes web browser protection that can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a phishing scam—which antivirus protection can’t do alone. Additionally, McAfee offers support from a licensed recovery pro who can help you restore your credit, just in case.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Should I replace my driver’s licence?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Per Medibank, some victims of the breach may have had their driver’s licence number exposed. Given that a licence </span><span data-contrast="auto">number </span><span data-contrast="none">is such a unique piece of personally identifiable information, anyone notified by Medibank that theirs may have been affected should strongly consider changing them.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Not all data breaches make the news. Businesses and organizations, large and small, have all fallen victim to them, and with regularity.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Exposure to </span><span data-contrast="auto">unwanted software</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can derail its performance and hog its storage within a few months of usage.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto">, also called Junkware or Potentially Unwanted Programs (</span><span data-contrast="auto">PUP</span><span data-contrast="auto">), are third-party programs that slow down the performance of your device and lay it bare to </span><span data-contrast="auto">cybersecurity</span><span data-contrast="auto"> risks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Manufacturers initially introduced </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to provide users with more utility, but the programs led to device issues. Software programs that identify as </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> run in the background, and locating them is not child&#8217;s play. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> finds its way into your device in two ways: it comes pre-installed or through programs downloaded from the internet. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Lenovo</span><span data-contrast="auto">&#8216;s Superfish </span><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407332/lenovos-superfish-bloatware-scandal-reveals-a-sneaky-tactic-we-thought-microsoft-had-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">bloatware</span></a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407332/lenovos-superfish-bloatware-scandal-reveals-a-sneaky-tactic-we-thought-microsoft-had-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> scandal</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from 2015 explains how </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can harm your devices. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">How can </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> impact your computer’s security?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned, not all </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is a threat to your device. Some may be useful and can be removed easily. But a major chunk of </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is known to slow down your computer. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> eats up a good chunk of the </span><span data-contrast="auto">disk space</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">hard drive </span><span data-contrast="auto">as it runs in the background, and it drains the </span><span data-contrast="auto">battery life</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that isn’t removed quickly may clog your device with annoying ads. These ads can pose a security threat or even corrupt your </span><span data-contrast="auto">operating system</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Can you remove </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sadly, it can be a challenge to </span><span data-contrast="auto">uninstall bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> because it finds its way back into the device — sometimes even after it has been deleted. In some cases, it may even redirect you to fake </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware removal</span><span data-contrast="auto"> websites and offer malicious </span><span data-contrast="auto">removal tools</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Such websites ask you to install a new program to remove the previous one, trapping your device further. Unfortunately, there are no secret hacks to stop it from finding a way into your system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Pro tip:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Anytime you download a program or software, be sure it&#8217;s from an official source (like a secured website, the Google Play Store, or the Apple App Store). Installing a program from a suspicious website can put your device at risk, as the program can download bundles of other programs on the back end without your knowledge. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Windows 10</span><span data-contrast="auto"> comes with a special refresh tool to remove any </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware disguised as </span><span data-contrast="auto">user-installed programs. This tool can bring your PC back to a clean slate. It’s important to check your </span><span data-contrast="auto">hard drive</span><span data-contrast="auto"> beforehand, as it can also remove licenses. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect your computer from dangerous security threats with McAfee</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can be both harmful and annoying. New devices need full-fledged protection so they can last longer. The answer to your </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> woes is an </span><span data-contrast="auto">antivirus</span><span data-contrast="auto"> program. It safeguards your computer from dangerous security threats and prevents accidental downloads, so malicious </span><span data-contrast="auto">bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can’t access your device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bloatware</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can compromise your online safety and security.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And chances are, you have more personal information posted online than you think.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-28-million-fraud-reports-consumers-2021-0#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20there%20were%20nearly%201.4%20million%20reports%20of%20identity%20theft%20received%20by%20the%20FTC." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">consumers registered 1.4 million identity theft complaints in 2021,</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> all part of a year where consumers reported losing $5.8 billion to fraud overall—a 70% increase over the year prior. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What fuels all this theft and fraud? Access to personal information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers and thieves can get a hold of personal information in several ways, such as through phishing attacks that lure you into handing it over, malware that steals it from your devices, by purchasing your information on dark web marketplaces, or as a result of information leaked in data breaches, just to name a few.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, scammers and thieves have other resources to help them commit theft and fraud—data broker sites, places where personal information is posted online for practically anyone to see. Which makes removing your info from them so important, from both an identity and privacy standpoint.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What are data broker sites?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Think of data broker sites as huge repositories of personal information. </span><span data-contrast="none">Search your name and address online and you’ll see. You’ll likely find dozens of sites that turn up information about you, some of which offer a few pieces for free and others that offer far more information for a price.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Data brokers collect and then aggregate personal information from several sources, including:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Your public records posted online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>

<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559684&quot;:-2,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">Along with retailers, who share information associated with your loyalty cards.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Data brokers also buy personal information from other data brokers. As a result, some data brokers have </span><a href="https://sites.sanford.duke.edu/techpolicy/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/08/Data-Brokers-and-Sensitive-Data-on-US-Individuals-Sherman-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">thousands of pieces of data for billions of individuals worldwide</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What could that look like? A broker may know how much you paid for your home, your education level, where you’ve lived over the years and who your lived with, your driving record, and possibly your political leanings. A broker may also know your favorite flavor of ice cream and your preferred over-the-counter allergy medicine thanks to information from loyalty cards. Further, they may also have health-related information from fitness apps. The amount of personal information can run that broadly, and that deeply.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With information at this potential level of detail, it’s no wonder that data brokers rake in </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">an estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars worldwide every year</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Who uses the personal information found on data broker sites? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On the legitimate side, it’s used by advertisers to create targeted ad campaigns. With information sold by data brokers, they can generate lists based on highly specific criteria, such as shopping histories, personal interests, and even political leanings as mentioned above. Likely without you being aware of it—and likely with no way to contest that information if it’s incorrect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Other legitimate uses include using these sites for background checks. Law enforcement, reporters, and employers will use data brokers as a starting point for research because the leg work has largely been done for them. Namely, data brokers have aggregated a person’s information already, which is an otherwise time-consuming process.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If this seems a little shady, it’s still legal. As of now, the U.S. has no federal laws that regulate data brokers or require data them to remove personal information if requested. A few states, such as </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/state-laws-related-to-internet-privacy.aspx#:~:text=Data%20Broker%20Privacy%20Laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Nevada, Vermont, and California</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, have legislation in place aimed at protecting consumers</span><span data-contrast="none">. Meanwhile, the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> has stricter rules about what information can be collected and what can be done with it. Still, the data broker economy thrives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On the darker side, scammers and thieves use personal information for identity theft and fraud. With enough personal information gathered from enough sources, they can create a high-fidelity profile of their victims. One that gives them enough information to open new accounts in their name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, from the standpoint of both privacy and identity, cleaning up your personal information online makes a great deal of sense. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to remove your personal information from the internet</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s review some ways you can remove your personal information from data brokers and other sources on the internet. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Request to remove data from data broker sites</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The process starts with finding the sites that have your information. From there, you can request to have it removed. Yet as mentioned above, there are dozens and dozens of these sites. Knowing where to start is a challenge in of itself, as is manually making the requests once you have identified the sites that post and sell information about you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our Personal Data Cleanup can do the work for you. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and can even manage the removal for you depending on your plan</span><span data-contrast="none">. ​</span><span data-contrast="none">It also monitors those sites, so if your info gets posted again, you can request its removal again.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Limit the data Google collects</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As of September 2022, Google accounts for just </span><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share"><span data-contrast="none">over 92%</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> of search engine market share worldwide. Aside from being a search engine, Google offers a myriad of other services and applications, such as Gmail and Google Maps. While Google offers plenty of tools for productivity, travel, work, and play for free, they still come at a cost—the gathering and analysis of your personal information.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can limit the data Google associates with you by </span><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en"><span data-contrast="none">removing your name from Google search results with a removal request</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This will disable anyone online from getting any results if they search your name. (Note that this will not remove your information from the original sites and sources where it’s posted.) Moreover, Google collects all your browsing data continuously. You have the option to turn on “Auto Delete” in your privacy settings to ensure that the data is deleted regularly and help limit the amount of time your sensitive data stays vulnerable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can also occasionally delete your cookies or use your browser in incognito mode to prevent websites from being tracked back to you. Go to your Google Chrome settings to clear your browser and cookie history. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Delete old social media accounts and make the ones you keep private</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As discussed above, data brokers can collect information from public social media profiles. You can minimize your presence on social media to the bare minimum. Make a list of the ones you use or have used in the past. If there are old accounts that you no longer use or websites that have gone by the wayside like Myspace or Tumblr, you may want to deactivate them or consider deleting them entirely.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For social media platforms that you still may use regularly, like Facebook and Instagram, consider adjusting your privacy settings to ensure that your personal information on these social media platforms is the bare minimum. For example, on Facebook you can lock your profile, while on Instagram you can stay private. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Remove personal info from other websites and blogs</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’ve ever published articles, written blogs, or created any content online, it might be a good time to consider taking it down if it is no longer serving a purpose. Depending on what you’ve posted, you may have shared personal details about your life. Additionally, you might be mentioned by other people in various social media posts, articles, or blogs. It is worth reaching out to these people to request them to take down posts with sensitive information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media and online articles that host your personal information are often used when businesses or hackers are doing “internet scrapes” to find better ways to use your targeted information. Asking your friends or third-party sites to remove that information can help protect your privacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Delete unused phone apps and restrict the settings for the ones you use</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another way you can tidy up your digital footprint online involves deleting all the unnecessary phone apps that you no longer need or use. Even when apps are not open or in use, they may be able to track personal information such as your real-time location and even your payment details if you have a paid subscription to the app.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some apps even sell this data as it can be extremely advantageous to other companies, which they use to target certain consumer segments and profiles for advertising. Try to share as little information with apps as possible if you’re looking to minimize your online footprint, and provide them access to your photos, contacts, and location only on as-needed basis and only when the app is in use. Your phone’s app and location services settings will give you the tools to do it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Online protection software can keep your personal information more private and secure</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to the steps above, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can keep you more private and minimize your risk of cybercrime. It can include:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most people are familiar with </span><span data-contrast="auto">phishing</span> <span data-contrast="auto">scams</span><span data-contrast="auto">, where </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> try to trick you into giving them your personal or </span><span data-contrast="auto">financial information</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by pretending to be a legitimate company or organization.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Football (or Soccer as we call it in the U.S.) is the most popular sport in the world, with over 3.5 billion fans across the globe. On November 20</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">, the men’s World Cup kicks off (pun intended) in Qatar. This event, a tournament played by 32 national teams every four years, determines the sport’s world champion. It will also be one of the most-watched sporting events of at least the last four years (since the previous World Cup).</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An event with this level of popularity and interest also attracts fraudsters and cyber criminals looking to capitalize on fans’ excitement. Here’s how to spot these scams and stay penalty-free during this year’s tournament.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">New Cup, who’s this?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a tool that cybercriminals have used for years now. Most of us are familiar with the telltale signs—misspelled words, poor grammar, and a sender email whose email address makes no sense or whose phone number is unknown. But excitement and anticipation can cloud our judgment. What football fan wouldn’t be tempted to win a free trip to see their home team participate in the ultimate tournament? Cybercriminals are betting that this excitement will cloud fans’ judgment, leading them to click on nefarious links that ultimately download malware or steal personal information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It&#8217;s important to realize that these messages can come via a variety of channels, including email, text messages, (also known as smishing) and other messaging channels like WhatsApp and Telegram. No matter what the source is, it’s essential to remain vigilant and pause to think before clicking links or giving out personal or banking information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For more information on phishing and how to spot a phisher, see McAfee’s “</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/"><span data-contrast="none">What is Phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">?” blog.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Real money for fake tickets</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to </span><a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/what-is-action-fraud"><span data-contrast="none">ActionFraud</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the UK’s national reporting center for fraud and cybercrime, thousands of people were victims of ticket fraud in 2019—and that’s just in the UK. Ticket fraud is when someone advertises tickets for sale, usually through a website or message board, collects the payment and then disappears, without the buyer ever receiving the ticket. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The World Cup is a prime (and lucrative) target for this type of scam, with fans willing to pay thousands of dollars to see their teams compete. Chances are most people have their tickets firmly in hand (or digital wallet) by now, but if you’re planning to try a last-minute trip, beware of this scam and make sure that you’re using a legitimate, reputable ticket broker. To be perfectly safe, stick with well-known ticket brokers and those who offer consumer protection. Also beware of sites that don’t accept debit or credit cards and only accept payment in the form of bitcoin or wire transfers such as the one on the fake ticket site below: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161314" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WC.png" alt="" width="624" height="246" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WC.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WC-300x118.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WC-205x81.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The red box on the right image shows that the ticket site accepts payment via Bitcoin. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Other red flags to look out for are websites that ask you to contact them to make payment and the only contact information is via WhatsApp.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Streaming the matches</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s be realistic—most of us are going to have to settle for watching the World Cup from the comfort of our own home, or the pub down the street. If you’re watching the tournament online, be sure that you’re using a legitimate streaming service. A quick Google of “FIFA World Cup 2022 Official Streaming” along with your country should get you the information you need to safely watch the event through official channels. </span><a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The FIFA site</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> itself is also a good source of information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Illegal streaming sites usually contain deceptive ads and malware which can cause harm to your </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/illegal-football-streaming-sites-are-absolutely-riddled-with-dangerous-malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">device</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Don’t get taken to the bank</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In countries or regions where sports betting is legal, the 2022 World Cup is expected to drive an increase in activity. There’s no shortage of things to bet on, from a simple win/loss to the exact minute a goal will be scored by a particular player. Everything is subject to wager.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As with our previous examples, this increase in legitimate gambling brings with it an increase in deceptive activity. Online betting scams often start when users are directed to or search for gambling site and end up on a fraudulent one. After placing their bets and winning, users realize that while they may have “won” money, they are unable to withdraw it and are even sometimes asked to deposit even more money to make winnings available, and even then, they still won’t be. By the end of this process, the bettor has lost all their initial money (and then some, potentially) as well as any personal information they shared on the site. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like other scams, users should be wary of sites that look hastily put together or are riddled with errors. Your best bet (yes, again, pun intended) is to look for an established online service that is approved by your government or region’s gaming commission. Finally, reading the fine print on incentives or bonuses is always a good idea. If something sounds too good to be true, it’s best to double-check.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For more on how you can bet online safely, and for details on how legalized online betting works in the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-protect-yourself-from-march-madness-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">check out our blog on the topic</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep that Connection Secure</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Using a free public Wi-Fi connection is risky. User data on these networks is unprotected, which makes it vulnerable to cyber criminals. Whether you’re traveling to Qatar for a match or watching the them with friends at your favorite pub, if you’re connecting to a public Wi-Fi connection, make sure you use a trusted </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/whats-the-meaning-of-vpn-vpn-defined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">VPN connection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Give scammers a straight red card this World Cup</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For more information on scams, visit our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/landing-page/retention/scammer-education.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">scam education page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Hopefully, with these tips, you’ll be able to enjoy and participate in some of the World Cup festivities, after all, fun is the goal! </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

As a mum of 4, I can tell you it always came in my top five, usually alongside driving, drugs, cigarettes and alcohol! But when McAfee research in May revealed that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/aussie-children-have-2nd-highest-rate-of-cyberbullying-time-to-focus-on-digital-parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Aussie kids experience the 2</span><span data-contrast="none">nd</span><span data-contrast="none"> highest rate of cyberbullying</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> out of the 10 countries interviewed, my heart skipped a beat. Clearly cyberbullying is a big problem for Aussie kids. Bigger than I had previously thought. But many of us parents had so many more questions: what can it look like? where does it happen? and could my child be a perpetrator?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, as an ally of connected families, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> set out to answer these questions so undertook more research through a detailed 10-country online questionnaire to 11,687 parents and their children in June. And the answers were quite revealing…</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What is Cyberbullying?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Before we get into the results, let’s clarify what cyberbullying means. There is often a lot of confusion because let’s be honest, different kids have different tolerances, standards and cultural lenses for what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour. The definition of cyberbullying used in McAfee’s report was based on the definition by </span><a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">StopBullying.Gov</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">:  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behaviour. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee’s definition was then expanded to include specific acts of cyberbullying, such as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Is The Most Common Form of Cyberbullying for Aussie Kids?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even though racially motivated cyberbullying is on the rise, name-calling is the most common form of cyberbullying with 40% of kids globally reporting that they have been on the receiving end of it. Interestingly, in Australia, our kids receive this style of bullying more frequently, with 49% of Aussie kids affected. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Exclusion from group chats and conversations is the 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> most commonly reported form of cyberbullying with 36% of kids globally experiencing it. In Australia, this is higher at 42%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The spreading of false rumours rounds out the top three forms and was reported by 28% of children globally. Curiously, Aussie kids don’t seem to use this form just as commonly with just 24% affected. Japan stands out as the leader in this reported form of cyberbullying at 44% followed by Germany at 35% and India at 39%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">1 in 8 Aussie kids reports receiving extreme cyberbullying threats eg stalking, harassment and physical threats online. This is in line with the global average however in India and the US, more young people are affected with 1 in 5 reporting this behaviour.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Where Is Cyberbullying Taking Place?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">It’s All About Social Media</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s no surprise that the bulk of cyberbullying is happening on social media with 32% of kids affected globally. Group chats come in as the 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> most commonplace with 24% of kids involved followed by online gaming being an issue for 22% of kids surveyed. 21% of kids experienced cyberbullying on websites and forums and 19% identified that they experienced cyberbullying via text messages. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, Facebook is the social media site where cyberbullying is most likely to occur. 53% of children report witnessing it and 50% report experiencing it. This is followed by Instagram (40% witnessing and 30% experiencing), YouTube, TikTok and then Twitter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, Aussie kids appear to experience less cyberbullying on social media with just 47% witnessing it on Facebook and 37% experiencing it. Our kids also report lower levels on Instagram as well with 34% witnessing and 30% experiencing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Snapchat Is a Cyberbullying Hot Bed for Aussie Kids</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It appears that Snapchat is unfortunately where a lot of undesirable behaviour happens for our Aussie kids with 34% reporting that they have been affected on this platform – a huge 10% above the international average and the highest of any country included in the survey.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Who’s Doing The Bullying?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Most Cyberbullying Comes From Someone Known To The Victim</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I’m sure it’s not a surprise to many parents that most cyberbullying comes from someone known to the victim. In fact, 57% of kids worldwide confirmed this with just 45% nominating that the cyberbullying they received had been initiated by a stranger. And Aussie kids’ experiences reflect the global norm with 56% expressing that they also knew the perpetrator but only 36% experienced cyberbullying from a stranger. Interestingly, only India, reported more cyberbullying at the hands of strangers (70%) than by someone the child knows (66%).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Most Kids Don’t Think They’ve Ever Been Cyberbullied But The Results Show Otherwise</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, 81% of all children surveyed stated that they had never cyberbullied anyone while just 19% admitted that they had. But when questioned further, it became apparent that there may be some disconnect. In fact, when asked about specific cyberbullying behaviours, more than half of children worldwide (53%) admitted to committing one or more types of cyberbullying —perhaps indicating that their definition of cyberbullying differs from the clinically accepted definition. The most common acts that they admitted to included making a joke at someone else’s expense (22%), name-calling (18%) and excluding someone from a chat or conversation (15%). </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Are Aussie Kids and Parents Worried?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It appears that our kids are calmer about the state of cyberbullying that their peers worldwide. Only 46% of our kids reported they were more concerned about being cyberbullied now than last year, compared to a 59% average worldwide. Aussie children said they are among the least concerned children in the world, alongside Canada at 44%, the U.K. at 43%, and Germany at 38%.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And Aussie parents also appear calmer than parents from other countries with only 61% nominating they were more concerned about their child being cyberbullied today versus last year, compared to the 72% international average.  Australian parents also showed the least level of worry that their child may be a cyberbully. Only 41% said that they worried this was more likely this year than last, compared to 56% of parents elsewhere.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, this could be because the online learning and tech-heavy phase of the pandemic is, thankfully, over and we are not as focussed on technology-related issues. Or perhaps it’s because we really are a nation of ‘laid-back’ types! The jury is still out…</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Do We Do About It?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all know that it’s impossible to fix a problem if you don’t truly understand it. So, while these statistics might be a little overwhelming, please soak them in. Appreciating the complexities of this problem and digesting how cyberbullying can look and impact our kids is essential. Now, as first-generation digital parents, it may take us a little longer to wrap our heads around it and that’s ok. The most important thing is that we commit to understanding the problem so that we are in the best position possible to support and guide our kids.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my next blog post, I will be sharing more detailed strategies that will help you minimise the risk of your child becoming a victim of cyberbullying. I will also include advice on what to do if your child is affected by cyberbullying plus what to do if your child is in fact a cyberbully.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

Well, there’s a good chance that anyone can find it online. All it takes is your name and address. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Thankfully, there’s something you can do about it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But first, go ahead and give it a try. Type your name and address in a search bar and see what comes up. If you’re like most people, your search results turned up dozens of sites with your information on them. Some sites offer bits of it for free. Other sites offer far more detailed information, for a price. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Who’s behind all this? Data brokers. All part of </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global data economy estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars a year</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> fueled by thousands of </span><a href="https://sites.sanford.duke.edu/techpolicy/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/08/Data-Brokers-and-Sensitive-Data-on-US-Individuals-Sherman-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data points on billions of people</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> scraped </span><span data-contrast="none">from public records, social media, third-party sources, and sometimes other data broker sites as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The result? A chillingly accurate picture of you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So accurate, that reporters and law enforcement will often use profiles from data broker sites to dig up a person’s background. And so could scammers and thieves. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Data brokers—a primary resource for spammers, scammers, and thieves</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ever wonder how you end up with all those spam calls and texts? Look no further than the data brokers. They help scammers compile the calling and texting lists they use. Yet spammy calls and texts are just part of the problem with these sites. They can give thieves the tools they need to steal your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">How? Visualize your identity as a jigsaw puzzle. Every bit of personal information makes up a piece, and if you cobble enough pieces together, a scammer or thief could have enough information to steal your identity. And data brokers compile all those pieces in one place and offer up them up in droves.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If you’re wondering if this activity is legal or at least regulated in some way, it largely isn’t. For example, the U.S. has no federal laws that require data brokers to remove personal information from their sites if requested to do so. On the state level, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/state-laws-related-to-internet-privacy.aspx#:~:text=Data%20Broker%20Privacy%20Laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Nevada, Vermont, and California have legislation in place aimed at protecting consumers</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> from having their data disclosed on these sites. Other legislation is being considered, yet as of this writing there’s very little on the books right now.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With next to no oversight, data brokers continue to collect personal information, which may or may not be accurate. It may be out of date or flat out wrong. Likewise, as it is with any large data store, </span><a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/major-data-broker-exposes-235-million-social-media-profiles-in-data-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data brokers are subject to hacks and attacks, which may lead to breaches</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that release detailed personal information onto the dark web and into the hands of bad actors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Put plainly, data brokers collect, buy, and sell high volumes of personal information, often in ways that leave no trace that it’s happening to you—or that the information is correct in any way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Removing your name and information from data broker sites</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">All this can feel like it’s out of your control. And maybe the search you did on yourself made you a little uneasy. (Understandable!) Yet you have plenty of ways you can curb this activity and even remove your information from some of the riskiest data broker sites as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It starts by finding out which sites have information on you, followed by filing requests to have it removed. Yet with dozens and dozens of these sites proliferating online, this can be a time-consuming process. Not to mention a frustrating one. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">We created McAfee+</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> so people can not only be safe but feel safe online, particularly in a time when there’s so much concern about identity theft and invasion of our online privacy.  McAfee+ contains a comprehensive set of tools, such as Personal Data Cleanup which are designed to help protect your online privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup scans some of the riskiest data broker sites and shows you which ones are selling your personal info.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> It also provides guidance on how you can remove your data from those sites and can even manage the removal for you depending on your plan</span><span data-contrast="none">. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And because getting your info removed once isn’t a guarantee that a data broker won’t collect and post it again, Personal Data Cleanup can continually monitor those sites. So should your info get posted again, you can request its removal again as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Seven ways you can keep your personal information from data brokers</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The other way you can thwart data brokers involves cleaning up your tracks when you go online, essentially leaving a smaller amount of data in your wake that they can collect and resell.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Classically, it’s a great way to shield your information from crooks and snoops while you’re banking, shopping, or handling any kind of sensitive information online. However, it has some terrific privacy benefits as well because it makes your time online more private by reducing the personal information that others can collect and track—including data brokers.</span></li>

Data brokers buy and sell purchasing histories to round out the personal profiles they create. If you’d rather keep data brokers from knowing what things you buy, make your purchases without your loyalty card. In all, it’s a tradeoff. Is the discount worth the potential hit to your privacy?</span></li>

If you’ve come across these prompts already you know that they’re hard to miss. Once you click on them, you have the option to select only the most necessary, functional cookies—and if you’d like to enable other cookies for convenience and perhaps marketing purposes.

Advertisers particularly love location data and will create highly targeted ad campaigns based on where you’re going and where you are. One source for this location data are your apps. Depending on the app and the user agreement in place, various apps may collect and share location information. Head to your phone’s settings and disable your location services app-by-app, keeping it enabled for only the most necessary of apps and for only while using the app.</span></li>

It works by tapping into your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections as they search for networks and devices they can pair with. Retailers have sensors that they can connect to, which then collect data. With that data they can determine several things, like when their stores see the most traffic, what the most popular items and displays are, or if you simply walk by the storefront and don’t enter. And because each smartphone has its own unique identifier, a MAC number (Media Access Control), there’s the possibility they can associate you with your phone. This one has a simple fix. Turn off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you’re not using them so you can’t be tracked.</span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Searching for your name and address can turn up some surprises and introduce you to the world of data brokers, the dozens and dozens of companies that collect, buy, and sell your personal information. While data brokers sell this information to companies for advertising and marketing purposes, </span><span data-contrast="none">they will also </span><span data-contrast="none">sell that information to hackers, scammers, and thieves.

If you’re like many professionals today, you use it for work, play, and a mix of personal business in between. Now, what if something went wrong with that phone, like loss or theft? Worse yet, what if your smartphone got hacked? <a href="https://mmsmcafee.onelink.me/mcafeefree/7tipstoprotectyourphone?path=blogs">Let’s try and keep that from happening to you.</a></span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, plenty of people pull double duty with their smartphones. In Spain, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1147490/share-adults-use-smartphone-business-personal-activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">one survey found that 55% of people use the same phone for a mix of personal and and work activity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The same survey showed that up to half of people interviewed in Japan, Australia, and the U.S. do so as well, while nations like the UK and Germany trailed at 31% and 23% respectively.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether these figures trend on the low or high end, the security implications remain constant. A smartphone loaded with business and personal data makes for a desirable target. Hackers target smartphones because they’re often unprotected, which gives hackers an easy “in” to your personal information and to any corporate networks you may use.  It’s like two hacks with one stone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Put simply, as a working professional with a smartphone, you’re a high-value target. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect your smartphone from being hacked</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As both a parent and a professional, I put together a few things you can do to protect your smartphone from hacks so that you can keep your personal and work life safe:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Add extra protection with your face, finger, pattern, or PIN.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">First up, the basics. Locking your phone with facial ID, a fingerprint, pattern or a pin is your most basic form of protection, particularly in the event of loss or theft. (Your options will vary depending on the device, operating system, and manufacturer.) Take it a step further for even more protection. Secure the accounts on your phone </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">with strong password</span></a><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and use </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/world-password-day-make-passwords-the-strongest-link-in-your-online-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">two-factor authentication</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on the apps that offer it, which doubles your line of defense.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Use a VPN.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Or, put another way, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-reports/need-watch-using-public-wi-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">don’t hop onto public Wi-Fi networks without protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. A VPN masks your connection from hackers allowing you to connect privately when you are on unsecure public networks at airports, cafes, hotels, and the like. With a VPN connection, you’ll know that your sensitive data, documents, and activities you do are protected from snooping, which is definitely a great feeling given the amount of personal and professional business we manage with our smartphones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Stick to the official app stores for your apps.</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both Google Play and Apple’s App Store have measures in place to help prevent potentially dangerous </span><span data-contrast="auto">apps from making it into their stores. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Malicious apps are often found outside of the app stores, which can run in the background and compromise your personal data like passwords, credit card numbers, and more—practically everything that you keep on your phone. Further, when you are in the app stores, look closely at the descriptions and reviews for apps before you download them. Malicious apps and counterfeits can still find their way into stores, and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/mobile-and-iot-security/fake-apps-taking-over-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">here are a few ways you can keep those bad apps from getting onto your phone</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Back up the data on your phone.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Backing up your phone is always a good idea for two reasons:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto">First, it makes the process of transitioning to a new phone easy by transferring that backed up data from your old phone to your new phone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto">Second, it ensures that your data stays with you if your phone is lost or stolen—allowing you to remotely wipe the data on your lost or stolen phone while still having a secure copy of that data stored in the cloud. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">iPhones</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/2819582?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Android phones</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> have straightforward ways of backing up your phone regularly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Learn how to lock or wipe your phone remotely in case of emergency.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Worst case scenario—your phone is gone. Really gone. Either it’s hopelessly lost or got stolen. What now? Lock it remotely or even wipe its data entirely. While that last bit about wiping the phone seems like a drastic move, if you maintain regular backups as mentioned above, your data is secure in the cloud—ready for you to restore. In all, this means that hackers won’t be able to access you, or your company’s, sensitive information—which can keep you out of trouble and your professional business safe. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide for remotely wiping devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Get rid of old apps—and update the ones you keep.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all download apps, use them once, and then forget they are on our phone. Take a few moments to swipe through your screen and see which ones you’re truly done with and delete them along with their data. Some apps have an account associated with them that may store data off your phone as well. Take the extra step and delete those accounts so any off-phone data is deleted. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The reason for this is that every extra app is another app that needs updating or that may have a security issue associated with it. In a time of data breaches and vulnerabilities, deleting old apps is a smart move. As for the ones you keep, update them regularly and turn on auto-updates if that’s an option. Updates not only introduce new features to apps, but they also often address security issues too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Protect your phone.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With so much of your life on your phone, getting security software installed on it can protect you and the things you keep on your phone. Whether you’re an </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/android.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Android</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> owner or </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/ios.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">iOS</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> owner, <a href="https://mmsmcafee.onelink.me/mcafeefree/7tipstoprotectyourphone?path=blogs">mobile security software</a> can keep your data, your shopping, and payments secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

So do some of the worst Black Friday and Cyber Monday scams.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Hackers, scammers, and thieves look to cash in this time of year by blending in with the holiday rush, spinning up their own fake shipping notices, phony deals, and even bogus charities that look legitimate at first glance, yet are anything but. Instead, they may be loaded with malware, point you to phishing sites that steal your personal info, or they may simply rip you off.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Classically, many online scams play on emotions by creating a sense of urgency or even fear. And for the holidays, you can throw stress into that mix as well—the stress of time, money, or even the pressure of finding that hard-to-get gift that seems to be out of stock everywhere. The bad actors out there will tailor their attacks around these feelings, hoping that they’ll catch you with your guard down during this busy time of year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">”The Five Least Wanted” – Top online shopping scams to avoid</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So while knowing how to spot a great gift at a great price is solid skill to have this time of year, so is the ability to spot a scam. Let’s look at some of the worst ones out there, along with what you can do to steer clear of them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) The fake order scam </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Come this time of year, keeping tabs on all the packages you have in transit can get tricky. You may have an armload of them enroute at any given time, and scammers will look to slip into this mix with phony order confirmations sent to your mailbox or your phone by text. Packed with either an email attachment or a link to a bogus website, they’ll try to get you to download malware or visit a site that attempts to steal your identity. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These messages can look quite legit, so the best way to keep track of your orders is on the sites where you purchased them. Go directly to those sites rather than clicking on any links or attachments you get.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) The phony tracking number scam</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This scam plays out much like the fake order scam, yet in this case the crooks will send a phony package tracking notification, again either as a link or as an attachment. For starters, legitimate retailers won’t send tracking numbers in an attached file. If you see anything like that, it’s surely a scam designed to inject malware onto your device. In the case of a link, the scammers aim to send you to a site that will steal your personal info, just like in the case above. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once again, the best way to track your packages is to go to the source. Visit the online store where you made your purchase, open your current orders, and get your package tracking information from there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) The bogus website scam </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A classic scammer move is to “typosquat” phony email addresses and URLs that look awfully close to legitimate addresses of legitimate companies and retailers. So close that you may overlook them. They often appear in phishing emails and instead of leading you to a great deal, these can in fact link you to scam sites that can then lift your login credentials, payment info, or even funds should you try to place an order through them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can avoid these sites by going to the retailer’s site directly. Be skeptical of any links you receive by email, text, or direct message—it’s best to go to the site yourself by manually typing in the legitimate address yourself and look for the deal there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) The hot deal scam </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At the heart of holiday shopping is scarcity. And scarcity is something scammers love. There’s always some super-popular holiday item that’s tough to find, and scammers will spin up phony websites and offers around those items to lure you in. They may use the typosquatting technique mentioned above to pose as a legitimate retailer, or they may set up a site with their own branding to look legitimate on their own (or at least try). Either way, these scams can hurt you in a couple of ways—one, you’ll pay for the goods and never receive them; and two, the scammers will now have your payment info and address, which they can use to commit further fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If the pricing, availability, or delivery time all look too good to be true for the item in question, it may be a scam designed to harvest your personal info and accounts. Use caution here before you click. If you’re unsure about a product or retailer, read reviews from trusted websites to help see if it’s legitimate. (The Better Business Bureau is a great place to start—more on that in moment.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5) The fake charity scam</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the season of giving, donating to charities in your name or in the name of others makes for a popular holiday gesture. Scammers know this too and will set up phony charities to cash in. Some indications that a phony charity has reached you include an urgent pitch that asks you to “act now.” A proper charity will certainly make their case for a donation, yet they won’t pressure you into it. Moreover, phony charities will outright ask for payment in the form of gift cards, wire transfers (like Western Union), money orders, or even cryptocurrency—because once those funds are sent, they’re nearly impossible to reclaim when you find out you’ve been scammed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are plenty of ways to make donations to legitimate charities, and </span><a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/giving-charity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a site full of resources so that you can make your donation truly count</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">So, how can I avoid getting scammed on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some of it takes an eagle eye that can spot these scams as they pop up in your inbox, texts, social media feed, and so on. Yet you have further ways you can keep safe while shopping on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and any time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stick with known, legitimate retailers online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is a great one to start with. Directly typing in the correct address for online stores and retailers is a prime way to avoid scammers online. In the case of retailers that you don’t know much about, </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/14147-bbb-tip-black-friday#:~:text=Do%20your%20research.%C2%A0Read%20product%20reviews%20on%20extremely%20discounted%20items.%20It%20could%20be%20a%20cheaper%20model%20or%20brand%20advertised%2C%20and%20not%20what%20was%20expected.%20Check%20BBB.org%27s%20business%20profiles%20of%20the%20stores%20and%20read%20what%20other%20customers%20have%20experienced." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the U.S. Better Business Bureau (BBB) asks shoppers to do their research and make sure that retailer has a good reputation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The BBB makes that easier with </span><a href="https://www.bbb.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a listing of retailers you can search</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> simply by typing in their name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Look for the lock icon in your browser when you shop</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Secure websites begin their address with “https,” not just “http.” That extra “s” in stands for “secure,” which means that it uses a secure protocol for transmitting sensitive info like passwords, credit card numbers, and the like over the internet. It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Pay with a credit card instead of your debit card </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., the Fair Credit Billing Act offers the public protection against fraudulent charges on credit cards, where citizens can dispute charges over $50 for goods and services that were never delivered or otherwise billed incorrectly. Note that many credit card companies have their own policies that improve upon the Fair Credit Billing Act as well. However, debit cards aren’t afforded the same protection under the Act. Avoid using a debit card while shopping online and use your credit card instead. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use two-factor authentication on your accounts </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of defense on top of your username and password. It adds in the use of a special one-time-use code to access your account, usually sent to you via email or to your phone by text or a phone call. In all, it combines something you know, like your password, with something you have, like your smartphone. Together, that makes it tougher for a crook to hack your account. If any of your accounts support two-factor authentication, the few extra seconds it takes to set up is more than worth the big boost in protection you’ll get. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Public Wi-Fi in coffee shops and other public locations can expose your private surfing to prying eyes because those networks are open to all. Using a virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your browsing, shopping, and other internet traffic, thus making it secure from attempts at intercepting your data on public Wi-Fi, such as your passwords and credit card numbers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What’s more, a VPN masks your whereabouts and your IP address, plus uses encryption that helps keep your activities private. As a result, companies and data brokers can potentially learn far less about you, your shopping, your travels, your habits, and any other information that they could possibly collect and otherwise profit from.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Keeping an eye on your bills and statements as they come in can help you spot unusual activity on your accounts. A credit monitoring service can do that one better by keeping daily tabs on your credit report. While you can do this manually, there are limitations.

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What should I do if I fall victim to a Black Friday or Cyber Monday scam?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even if you take the proper precautions the unexpected can happen. Whether it’s a scam, an identity crime, or flat-out theft, there are steps you can take right away to help minimize the damage.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The first bit of advice is to take a deep breath and get right to work on recovery. From there, you can take the following steps:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Notify the companies involved</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you spot a curious charge on your bank statement, discover potentially a fraudulent account when you check credit report, or when you get an alert from your monitoring service, let the bank or organization involved know you suspect fraud or theft. With a visit to their website, you can track down the appropriate number to call and get the investigation process started.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. File a police report</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some businesses will require you to file a local police report and acquire a case number to complete your claim. Beyond that, filing a report is a good idea in itself. Identity theft is still theft and reporting it provides an official record of the incident. Should your case of identity theft lead to someone impersonating you or committing a crime in your name, filing a police report right away can help clear your name down the road. Be sure to save any evidence you have, like statements or documents that are associated with the theft. They can help clean up your record as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Contact your governmental anti-fraud or trade organization</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the U.S., </span><a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the identity theft website from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a fantastic resource should you find yourself in need</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition to keeping records of the theft, the FTC can provide you with a step-by-step recovery plan—and even walk you through the process if you create an account with them. Additionally, reporting theft to the FTC can prove helpful if debtors come knocking to collect on any bogus charges in your name. With a copy of your report, you can ask debtors to stop.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Put on a credit freeze or lock</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An instance of identity fraud or theft, suspected or otherwise, is a good time to review your options for a credit freeze or lock. As mentioned earlier, see what the credit bureaus in your region offer, along with the terms and conditions of each. With the right decision, a freeze or lock can help minimize and prevent further harm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Continue to monitor</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Strongly consider using a monitoring service like the one we described earlier to help you continue to keep tabs on your identity. The unfortunate fact of identity theft and fraud is that it can mark the start of a long, drawn-out affair. One instance of theft can possibly lead to another, so even what may appear to be an isolated bad charge on your credit card calls for keeping an eye on your identity all around. Many of the tools you would use up to this point still apply, such as checking up on your credit reports, maintaining fraud alerts as needed, and reviewing your accounts closely—along with utilizing an identity monitoring service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Work with a recovery pro</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A recovery service can help you clean up your credit in the wake of fraud or theft, all by working on your behalf. Given the time, money, and stress that can come along with setting your financial record straight, leaning on the expertise of a professional can provide you with much-needed relief on several counts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><span data-contrast="auto">Take an extra moment to spot those Black Friday and Cyber Monday scams </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Just as it’s always been, hackers, scammers, and thieves want to ruin a good thing. In this case, it’s your spirit of giving and sharing in the holiday season. Yet with this list of top scams and ways you can avoid them, you can keep bad actors like them at bay. Remember, they’re counting on you to be in a hurry this time of year, and maybe a bit stressed and a little disorganized to boot. Take your time while shopping out there and keep an eye out for their tricks. That extra moment can save you far more time and money than you may think.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

It is only natural to want to protect your device like a royal family fortifying a medieval castle. Unlike medieval castles that depended upon layers and layers of protection (moats, drawbridges, spiky gates, etc.), personal devices thrive on just one defense: a devoted guard called </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">antivirus software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Increasing your personal device’s security detail with more than one guard, or antivirus software is actually less effective than using a single, comprehensive option. Microsoft operating systems recognize the detriment of running two antivirus software programs simultaneously for real-time protection. Microsoft Windows automatically unregisters additional programs so they do not compete against each other. In theory, if you have a Microsoft device, you could run on-demand or scheduled scans from two different antivirus products without the operating system disabling one of them. But why invest in multiple software where one will do? </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you do not have a Microsoft device, here is what could happen to your device if you run more than one antivirus program at a time, and why you should consider investing in only one top-notch product. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Fight over potential viruses </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Antivirus programs want to impress you. Each wants to be the one to catch a virus and present you with the culprit, like a cat with a mouse. When antivirus software captures a virus, it locks it in a secure place to neutralize it. If you have two programs running simultaneously, they could engage in a tussle over who gets to scan, report, and remove the virus. This added activity could cause your computer to crash or use up your device’s memory. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Report each other as suspicious </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Antivirus software quietly monitors and collects information about how your system runs, which is similar to how viruses operate. One software could mark the other as suspicious because real-time protection software is lurking in the background. So, while one antivirus program is busy blowing the whistle on the other, malicious code could quietly slip by. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, users could be buried under a barrage of red flag notifications about each software reporting the other as suspicious. Some users become so distracted by the onslaught of notifications that they deactivate both programs or ignore notifications altogether, leaving the device vulnerable to real threats. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Drain your battery and slow down your device </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Running one antivirus software does not drain your battery, and it can actually </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/myth-busting-antivirus-software-assumptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">make your device faster</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. However, two antivirus programs will not double your operating speed. In fact, it will make it run much slower and drain your battery in the process. With two programs running real-time protection constantly in the background, device performance is extremely compromised. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Antivirus software best practices </span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There is no reason to invest in two antivirus programs when one solid software will more than do the trick to protect your device. Here are some best practices to get the most out of your antivirus software: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">1. Back up files regularly</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One habit you should adopt is backing up your files regularly. You never know when malware could hit and corrupt your data. Add it to your weekly routine to sync with the cloud and back up your most important files to an external hard drive.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">2. Keep your software up to date</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whenever your software prompts you to install an update, do it! New cyber threats are evolving every day, and the best way to protect against them is to allow your software to stay as up-to-date as possible. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">3. Read the results reports </span><b><span data-contrast="none">  </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Always read your antivirus results reports. These reports let you know the suspicious suspects your software was busy rounding up. It will give you a good idea of the threats your devices face and perhaps the schemes that you unknowingly fell into, such as clicking on a link in a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing email</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This information can also help you improve your online safety habits. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Go with the single strongest antivirus, and more </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Everyone needs strong antivirus. Yet antivirus alone isn’t enough to beat back today’s threats. Hackers, scammers, and thieves rely on far more tricks than viruses and malware to wage their attacks, and data breaches slip billions of personal and financial records into the hands of bad actors.

<h3><strong>My McAfee career journey story</strong></h3>
<p>It’s been an amazing ride so far. My team touches on several areas of responsibility, including financial period closing, financial reporting, and accounting for complex transactions.</p>
<p>​​​​​​​The most rewarding part of my role is definitely the variety and complexity – they really go hand-in-hand and I enjoy asking questions and figuring out the solutions, even when there is not always a textbook answer. I enjoy the challenge of working collectively with a team to find solutions by applying research and experience to a set of facts.</p>
<p>It’s also rewarding to be able to collaborate with auditors and other stakeholders who would be interested in the results.</p>
<h3><strong>Talent and collaboration – a rare combo</strong></h3>
<p><strong>​​​​​​​</strong>My favorite thing about working at McAfee is the team. We have an amazing team. It’s full of really smart people. I’ve seen some companies try and find the best talent they can, but McAfee has just taken that to a whole different level. Everyone in their respective areas is really tuned in to the broader effort and we work well together. At McAfee, we enjoy both a high level of talent and collaborative effort. You don’t often find both in the same place. ​​​​​​​</p>
<h3><strong>My leadership philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>I really believe that each person brings certain strengths to the table, and they should be able to exercise those strengths to develop and expand their capabilities. Once those natural roles are established, it’s best to trust them to determine how best to perform in their roles and collaborate with the team in achieving results that add value to the broader group.</p>
<h3><strong>My advice for anyone looking to drive their career forward is</strong></h3>
<p>​​​​​​​First, expect the unexpected – consider each new experience an opportunity for personal growth.</p>
<p>Secondly, get involved in projects. If you have the opportunity to do something different or work with a cross-functional team, do it. It builds your own skill base, which opens the door for greater future opportunities and you get to meet people outside of your own department and develop relationships that may prove valuable over time.</p>

You can do amazing things like stream the latest movies while they’re still in theaters! Or you can enjoy the convenience of online shopping and avoiding the DMV by renewing your driver’s license remotely.  This is possible because we’re able to communicate with these organizations through many different channels and we trust them. Unfortunately, many bad actors have taken advantage of this trust and the ease of communication to up their game when it comes to social engineering. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What is social engineering? One of the more famous examples of social engineering was the Nigerian Prince email scam. In this example, hackers relied on a novel, too-good-to-be-true story of a prince looking to transfer some of his fortune if only he could use your bank account number. The Nigerian Prince is a running joke these days, the internet version of “if you believe that, then I have a bridge to sell you,” but its original success made scammers realize they were onto something big. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Modern social engineering campaigns closely resemble communications from legitimate organizations. They’re carefully designed, may be grammatically correct, and appear in completely plausible scenarios. However, they’re all after the same thing – information to gain access to an organization or individual&#8217;s accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Phishing is common form of social engineering</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses email or websites to convince people to give up their personal information, under the guise of a plausible reason. Instead of a Nigerian prince asking for a bank account number, an email posing as your bank may ask for you to confirm your account information. Often these emails are tied to circumstances that demand your attention and reflect a sense of urgency. Needless to say, many recent phishing scams have played into COVID-19 pandemic fears and economic concerns. Here are a few other scams related to phishing to watch out for:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

And what’s making it extra tricky is that it’s disguised as an operating system update.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be on the lookout for this new ransomware scheme and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">protect yourself from ransomware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> with a few of these tips.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Is Magniber Ransomware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Magniber is a new type of ransomware that is disguised at almost every touchpoint until it seemingly pops out of nowhere demanding money. The attack begins when someone visits a fake Windows 10 update website owned by the Magniber cybercriminal group. Once someone clicks on a malicious link on that site, file-encrypting malware downloads onto the device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another stealth maneuver of Magniber is that the encryption malware downloads as a JavaScript file straight to the memory of the device, which can often slide under an antivirus’ radar. This malware allows the criminal to view, delete, and encrypt files and gain administrator access of the device. Usually, before the person even knows their device is in danger, Magniber reveals itself and demands a ransom payment in exchange for releasing the documents and giving back control of the computer. If the device owner refuses to pay, the criminal threatens to delete the files forever.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Personal Ransomware May Be on the Rise</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For the last several years, large companies fell left and right to breaches. Hacker groups infiltrated complex cybersecurity defenses, got ahold of sensitive company or customer information, and threatened to release their findings on the dark web if not paid a hefty ransom. The reasons cybercriminals targeted corporate databases versus personal devices wasn’t just because they could demand multiple millions, but because companies were better equipped to make ransom transactions anonymously. Often, cryptocurrency transactions are untraceable, which allows criminals to remain at large.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now that more everyday people are proficient in cryptocurrency, ransomware may shift to targeting personal devices. Though the ransom payments won’t be as lucrative, there also won’t be corporate cybersecurity experts hot on the cybercriminal’s tail.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">To avoid ransomware schemes similar to Magniber, adopt these three habits to better protect your device and digital privacy:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Consider configuring your device to auto-update. If you enable automatic updates, you can then treat any other popups or update websites with skepticism. To validate if an update prompt is genuine, go to your operating system or device’s corporate page and search for any announcements about new updates. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Not only will that free up memory on your device, but it’ll also protect them in case a cybercriminal takes control of your computer. When your device is scrubbed of these important files in the first place, you can factory reset your device without losing anything. That way, the cybercriminal gets nothing: neither your personal information nor your money.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

If you’re ever suspicious about any site, it’s best to leave and not click on any links while you’re there. Even sites that attempt to mimic legitimate ones leave a few clues that they’re fake. Check for typos, blurry logos, incorrect grammar, and hyperlinks that direct to long, unfamiliar URLs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Along with Diwali comes the traditional acts of dana and seva, as well as gift-giving to the friends and family members they honor and love. However, it’s also a time when thieves get busy—where they hop online and take advantage of all that goodwill with all manner of scams.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s unfortunate yet true. Thieves flock to where the money is, and plenty of money gets exchanged online during Diwali. As you shop online for that thoughtful gift or to donate online to a cause you care about, keep an eye out for the scams that these thieves set. Because they’re out there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet you have several ways you can spot their scams, along with several ways you can protect yourself further from them. The thing is, online thieves tend to use the same old tricks, which means a sharp eye and a little prevention on your part can keep you far safer during Diwali. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For starters, let’s look at some of the most common scams out there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Top online shopping scams to avoid during Diwali</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1) The bogus website scam </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A classic scammer move is to “typosquat” phony email addresses and URLs that look awfully close to legitimate addresses of legitimate companies and retailers. So close that you may overlook them. They often appear in phishing emails and instead of leading you to a great deal, these can in fact link you to scam sites that can then lift your login credentials, payment info, or even funds should you try to place an order through them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can avoid these sites by going to the retailer’s site directly. Be skeptical of any links you receive by email, text, or direct message—it’s best to go to the site yourself by manually typing in the legitimate address yourself and looking for the deal there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2) The hot deal scam </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In some cases, thieves will set up shopping websites that offer a popular or hard-to-find item at a great price. Yet if the pricing, availability, or delivery time all look too good to be true for the item in question, it may be a scam designed to harvest your personal info and accounts—because, surprise, they don’t have the item at all. The site will take your payment, yet you’ll never receive the item. What’s more, the scammers will have your payment info and address, which they can use to cause further harm.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Use caution here before you click. If you’re unsure about a product or retailer, read reviews from trusted websites to help see if it’s legitimate. You can also use a service like </span><a href="https://who.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Who.Is</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and see how recently the site was created. If the site was only put up very recently, it could be a sign of a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3) The fake charity scam</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the spirit of dana, donating to charities makes for a popular Diwali gesture. Scammers know this too and will set up phony charities to cash in. Some indications that a phony charity has reached you include an urgent pitch that asks you to “act now.” A proper charity will certainly make their case for a donation, yet they won’t pressure you into it. Moreover, phony charities will outright ask for payment in the form of gift cards, wire transfers, money orders, or even cryptocurrency—because once those funds are sent, they’re nearly impossible to reclaim when you find out you’ve been scammed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are plenty of ways to make donations to legitimate charities, and</span><a href="https://ngodarpan.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none"> the NGO Darpan site offers resources that can help you make an informed choice</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4) Prize and gift scams</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether they come to you by email, direct message, or text message, scammers will blast out phoney prize and gift notifications during Diwali. And of course, there’s a catch. To claim your “prize” or “gift,” the scammers require you to fill out a questionnaire. Once again, there’s no gift or prize in play here. Just a thief on the other end attempting to steal your personal information to commit other fraud down the road. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Look out for these scams, as many have URLs that end in .cn (the Chinese domain). Both .xyz, and .top are popular URL domains for these scams. Several can look quite legitimate, yet if you haven’t entered in a legitimate contest, drawing, or lottery yourself, there’s a very good chance this is a scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Avoid getting scammed during Diwali</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Aside from knowing how to spot scams, you can take several other preventative measures that can keep you safe as you shop, donate, or simply spend time online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stick with known, legitimate retailers and charities online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is a great one to start with. Directly typing in the correct address for online stores and retailers is a prime way to avoid scammers online. As mentioned in the bogus website scam and the prize scams above, thieves will often create web addresses that look nearly identical to legitimate addresses of well-known companies hoping that you won’t look closely at them, then click or tap that bad link. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you get an offer sent to you via email, text, or any other message, don’t click the link. Visit the site directly and look for the offer there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Look for the lock icon in your browser when you shop</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Secure websites begin their address with “https,” not just “http.” That extra “s” in stands for “secure,” which means that it uses a secure protocol for transmitting sensitive info like passwords, credit card numbers, and the like over the internet. It often appears as a little padlock icon in the address bar of your browser, so double-check for that. If you don’t see that it’s secure, it’s best to avoid making purchases on that website. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use a VPN if you’re shopping on public Wi-Fi </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Public Wi-Fi in coffee shops and other public locations can expose your private surfing to prying eyes because those networks are open to all. Using a virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your browsing, shopping, and other internet traffic, thus making it secure from attempts at intercepting your data on public Wi-Fi, such as your passwords and credit card numbers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What’s more, a VPN masks your whereabouts and your IP address, plus uses encryption that helps keep your activities private. As a result, companies and data brokers can potentially learn far less about you, your shopping, your travels, your habits, and any other information that they could possibly collect and otherwise profit from.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use protection while you shop online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A complete suite of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-in/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">online protection software like McAfee can offer layers of extra security while you shop</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition to the VPN, identity, credit monitoring, and other features mentioned above, it includes web browser protection that can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a phishing scam—along with a password manager that can create strong, unique passwords and store them securely as well. Taken together, McAfee offers </span><span data-contrast="none">all-in-one online protection for your</span><span data-contrast="auto"> identity, privacy, and security that can keep you far safer when you shop online—and as you spend your time online in general.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">A brighter, safer Diwali for you and your family online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">If celebrating Diwali takes you online in any way, keep an eye open for the scams that typically pop up this time of year. Sadly, they’re out there, because it’s such a prime time of year for online shopping, gift-giving, and donations. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As you can see, thieves use several types of common scams that simply dress themselves up in different ways. Taking a moment to pause and consider what you’re seeing before you click or buy can help you spot those scams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Further, using online protection software can help you stay safer still with features that make your time online more private and secure while also preventing you from clicking on any of those malicious links or attachments that crop up during Diwali—and any time of year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Follow up. What you’re seeing could be a problem. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A missing bill or a mysterious charge on your credit card could be the tip of an identity theft iceberg, one that can run deep if left unaddressed. Here, we’ll look at several signs of identity theft that likely need some investigation and the steps you can take to take charge of the situation. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How does identity theft happen in the first place? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Unfortunately, it can happen in several ways.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">In the physical world,</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> it can happen simply because you lost your wallet or debit card. However, there are also cases where someone gets your information by going through your mail or trash for bills and statements. In other more extreme cases, theft can happen by someone successfully registering a change of address form in your name (although the U.S. Postal Service has security measures in place that make this difficult).  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">In the digital world,</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> that’s where the avenues of identity theft blow wide open. It could come by way of a data breach, a thief “skimming” credit card information from a point-of-sale terminal, or by a dedicated crook piecing together various bits of personal information that have been gathered from social media, phishing attacks, or malware designed to harvest information. Additionally, thieves may eavesdrop on public Wi-Fi and steal information from people who’re shopping or banking online without </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/vpn?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the security of a VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of how crooks pull it off, identity theft is on the rise. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2020/csn_annual_data_book_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft claims jumped up from roughly 650,000 claims in 2019 to nearly 1.4 million in 2020—practically double</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Of the reported fraud cases where a dollar loss was reported, the FTC calls out the following top three contact methods for identity theft: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, phone calls, texts, and email remain the most preferred contact methods that fraudsters use, even if they are less successful in creating dollar losses than malicious websites, ads, and social media. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What are some signs of identity theft? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Identity thieves leave a trail. With your identity in hand, they can charge things to one or more of your existing accounts—and if they have enough information about you, they can even create entirely new accounts in your name. Either way, once an identity thief strikes, you’re probably going to notice that something is wrong. Possible signs include: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As you can see, the signs of possible identity theft can run anywhere from, “Well, that’s strange …” to “OH NO!” However, the good news is that there are several ways to check if someone is using your identity before it becomes a problem – or before it becomes a big problem that gets out of hand.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Steps to take if you suspect that you’re the victim of identity theft </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The point is that if you suspect fraud, you need to act right away. With identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, many businesses, banks, and organizations have fraud reporting mechanisms in place that can assist you should you have any concerns. With that in mind, here are some immediate steps you can take: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">1) Notify the companies and institutions involved</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you spot a curious charge on your bank statement or </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you discover what looks like a fraudulent account when you get your free credit report</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, let the bank or business involved know you suspect fraud. With a visit to their website, you can track down the appropriate number to call and get the investigation process started.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">2) File a police report</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some businesses will require you to file a local police report to acquire a case number to complete your claim. Even beyond a business making such a request, filing a report is still a good idea. Identity theft is still theft and reporting it provides an official record of the incident. Should your case of identity theft lead to someone impersonating you or committing a crime in your name, filing a police report right away can help clear your name down the road. Be sure to save any evidence you have, like statements or documents that are associated with the theft. They can help clean up your record as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">3) Contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The FTC’s identity theft website is a fantastic resource should you find yourself in need</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Above and beyond simply reporting the theft, the FTC can provide you with a step-by-step recovery plan—and even walk you through the process if you create an account with them. Additionally, reporting theft to the FTC can prove helpful if debtors come knocking to collect on any bogus charges in your name. You can provide them with a copy of your FTC report and ask them to stop. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">4) Place a fraud alert and consider a credit freeze</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can place a free one-year fraud alert with one of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax), and they will notify the other two. A fraud alert will make it tougher for thieves to open accounts in your name, as it requires businesses to verify your identity before issuing new credit in your name. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A credit freeze goes a step further. As the name implies, a freeze prohibits creditors from pulling your credit report, which is needed to approve credit. Such a freeze is in place until you lift it, and it will also apply to legitimate queries as well. Thus, if you intend to get a loan or new credit card while a freeze is in place, you’ll likely need to take extra measures to see that through. Contact </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">each </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">of the major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) to put a freeze in place or lift it when you’re ready. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">5) Dispute any discrepancies in your credit reports</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This can run the gamut from closing any false accounts that were set up in your name, removing bogus charges, and correcting information in your credit report such as phony addresses or contact information. With your FTC report, you can dispute these discrepancies and have the business correct the record. Be sure to ask for written confirmation and keep a record of all documents and conversations involved.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">6) Contact the IRS, if needed</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you receive a notice from the IRS that someone used your identity to file a tax return in your name, follow the information provided by the IRS in the notice. From there, </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can file an identity theft affidavit with the IRS</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. If the notice mentions that you were paid from an employer you don’t know, contact that employer as well and let them know of possible fraud—namely that someone has stolen your identity and that you don’t truly work for them. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also, be aware that the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-to-know-its-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">IRS has specific guidelines as to how and when they will contact you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. As a rule, they will most likely contact you via physical mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. (They won’t call or apply harassing pressure tactics—only scammers do that.) Identity-based tax scams are a topic all of their own, and for more on it, you can check out this article on </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-spot-and-prevent-the-tax-scams-that-target-elders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">tax scams and how to avoid them</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="none">7) Continue to monitor your credit report, invoices, and statements</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another downside of identity theft is that it can mark the start of a long, drawn-out affair. One instance of theft can possibly lead to another, so even what may appear to be an isolated bad charge on your credit card calls for keeping an eye on your identity. Many of the tools you would use up to this point still apply, such as checking up on your credit reports, maintaining fraud alerts as needed, and reviewing your accounts closely. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Preventing identity theft</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With all the time we spend online as we bank, shop, and simply surf, we create and share all kinds of personal information—information that can get collected and even stolen. The good news is that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can prevent theft and fraud with online protection software, such as McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Realizing that you’ve become a victim of identity theft carries plenty of emotion with it, which is understandable—the thief has stolen a part of </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">you </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">to get at your money, information, and even reputation. Once that initial rush of anger and surprise has passed, it’s time to get clinical and get busy. Think like a detective who’s building – and closing – a case. That’s exactly what you’re doing. Follow the steps, document each one, and build up your case file as you need. Staying cool, organized, and ready with an answer for any questions you’ll face in the process of restoring your identity will help you see things through. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Perhaps the company logo looked slightly misshapen, or the font seemed off-brand. Odds are, you landed on a phony version of a legitimate corporation’s website—a tried and true tactic relied on by many cybercriminals. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Fake Login Pages Explained </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A fake login page is essentially a knock-off of a real login page used to trick people into entering their login credentials, which hackers can later use to break into online accounts. These websites mirror legitimate pages by using company logos, fonts, formatting, and overall templates. Depending on the attention to detail put in by the hackers behind the imposter website, it can be nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing. Consequentially, fake login pages can be highly effective in their end goal: credential theft. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How do these pages get in front of a consumer in the first place? Typically, scammers will target unsuspecting recipients with </span><span data-contrast="auto">phishing emails</span><span data-contrast="auto"> spoofing a trusted brand. These emails may state that the user needs to reset their password or entice them with a deal that sounds too good to be true. If the consumer clicks on the link in the email, they will be directed to the fake login page and asked to enter their username and password. Once they submit their information, cybercriminals can use the consumer’s data to conduct credential stuffing attacks and hack their online profiles. This could lead to credit card fraud, data extraction, wire transfers, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">identity theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Fake Login Pages Are Affecting Canadians</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Scammers have recently targeted Canadians with attacks leveraging fake login pages to harvest personal data. For example, criminals preyed on employees who were expecting </span><a href="https://www.real-sec.com/2020/10/twelve-flavors-of-phish-canadian-workers-targeted-with-fake-covid-19-relief-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">COVID-19 relief grants </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">in the form of the CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit). These funds were sent via an electronic transfer from Interac, a legitimate Canadian interbank network. However, a phishing campaign spoofing Interac’s e-transfer service circulated emails claiming that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) made a CERB deposit of $1,957.5</span><span data-contrast="auto">0</span><span data-contrast="auto"> CAD. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These emails directed recipients to a fake CRA login page, which then redirected to a phony Interac e-transfer site where users were asked to select their personal bank. From there, the recipient was asked to enter their username, card number, password, security questions and answers for their </span><span data-contrast="auto">online banking</span><span data-contrast="auto"> profile, and other personally identifiable information—providing all the information a criminal would need to hack into the user’s bank account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why Fake Login Pages are Effective </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you Google “fake login pages,” you will quickly find countless guides on how to create fake websites in seconds. Ethical concerns aside, this demonstrates just how common vector spoofed websites are for cyberattacks. While it has been easier to distinguish between real and fake login pages in the past, criminals are constantly updating their techniques to be more sophisticated, therefore making it more difficult for consumers to recognize their fraudulent schemes. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One reason </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/onedrive-phishing-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">why fake login pages are so effective</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is due to </span><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/inattentional-blindness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">inattentional blindness</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, or failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention. One of the most famous studies on inattentional blindness is the “invisible gorilla test.” In this study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white shirts passing basketballs. Participants were asked to count the number of times the team in white passed the ball:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Monkey Business Illusion" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGQmdoK_ZfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because participants were intently focused on counting the number of times the players in white passed the ball, more than 50% failed to notice the person in the gorilla costume walking through the game. If this is the first time you’ve seen this video, it’s likely that you didn’t notice the gorilla, the curtain changing color from red to gold, or the player in black leaving the game. Similarly, if you come across a well-forged login page and aren’t actively looking for signs of fraud, you could inherently miss a cybercriminal’s “invisible gorilla.” That’s why it’s crucial for even those with phishing training to practice caution when they come across a website asking them to take action or enter personal details. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Steer Clear of Fake Login Pages </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The most important defense against steering clear of fake login pages is knowing how to recognize them. Follow these tips to help you decipher between a legitimate and a fake website: </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Don’t fall for phishing </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most fake login pages are circulated vis </span><span data-contrast="auto">phishing</span><span data-contrast="auto"> messages. If you receive a suspicious message that asks for personal details, there are a few ways to determine if it was sent by a phisher aiming to steal your identity. Phishers often send messages with a tone of urgency, and they try to inspire extreme emotions such as excitement or fear. If an unsolicited email urges you to “act fast!” slow down and evaluate the situation.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Look for misspellings or grammatical errors </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Oftentimes, hackers will use a URL for their spoofed website that is just one character off from the legitimate site, such as using “www.rbcr0yalbank.com” versus “www.rbcroyalbank.com.” Before clicking on any website from an email asking you to act, hover over the link with your cursor. This will allow you to preview the URL and identify any suspicious misspellings or grammatical errors before navigating to a potentially dangerous website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Ensure the website is secured with HTTPS</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a protocol that encrypts your interaction with a website. Typically, websites that begin with HTTPS and feature a padlock in the top left corner are considered safer. However, cybercriminals have more recently developed malware toolkits that leverage </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">HTTPS</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> to hide malware from detection by various security defenses. If the website is secured with HTTPS, ensure that this isn’t the only way you’re analyzing the page for online safety. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Enable multi-factor authentication</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Multi-factor authentication requires that users confirm a collection of things to verify their identity—usually something they have, and a factor unique to their physical being—such as a retina or fingerprint scan. This can prevent a cybercriminal from using credential-stuffing tactics (where they will use email and password combinations to hack into online profiles) to access your network or account if your login details were ever exposed during a data breach. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Sign up for an identity theft alert service</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">An identity theft alert service warns you about suspicious activity surrounding your personal information, allowing you to jump to action before irreparable damage is done. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-ca/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> not only keeps your devices safe from viruses but gives you the added peace of mind that your identity is secure, as well. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

These scams are becoming increasingly popular as cybercriminals try to take advantage of people who are more likely to fall for them, such as those who aren&#8217;t as familiar with technology or who may be experiencing a crisis.</p>
<p>Be aware that cybercrime and hacking can happen to anyone. Criminals are always looking for new ways to exploit people, and they know that others may not be cautious or recognize the warning signs of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/">phishing</a> scams when using the internet. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to be aware of the different types of cybercrime and how to protect yourself.</p>
<p>This article discusses how to protect yourself from smishing attempts and scams where criminals try to get you to click on a fraudulent link or respond to their voicemail message to steal your personal data.</p>
<h2>What is smishing?</h2>
<p>Most people are familiar with phishing scams, where scammers try to trick you into giving them your personal or financial information by pretending to be a legitimate company or organization. But have you ever heard of smishing or vishing?</p>
<p>Smishing is a type of phishing scam where attackers send SMS messages (or text messages) to trick victims into sharing personal information or installing malware on their devices. Vishing is almost identical to smishing, except cybercriminals use VoIP (Voice over IP) to place phone calls to trick victims instead of SMS (short message service) messages.</p>
<p>Smishing messages often appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a well-known company or government agency. It may even include urgent language or threats in an effort to get victims to act quickly. In some cases, the message may also include a link that directs victims to a fake website where they are prompted to enter personal information or download malware.</p>
<h3>Examples of a smishing text message</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of smishing text messages hackers use to steal your personal details:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;We have detected unusual activity on your account. Please call this number to speak to a customer service representative.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;You have won a free gift card! Click here to claim your prize.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Hi! We noticed that you&#8217;re a recent customer of ours. To finish setting up your account, please click this link and enter your personal information.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Urgent! Your bank account has been compromised. Please click this link to reset your password and prevent any further fraud.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s [person you know]! I&#8217;m in a bit of a bind and could really use your help. I sent you a link to my PayPal, could you send me some money?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>How dangerous can smishing be?</h2>
<p>If you fall for a smishing scam, you could end up giving away your personal information or money. Cybercriminals use smishing messages to get personal and financial information, like your credit card number or access to your financial services.</p>
<p>For example, one type of smishing scam is when you get a text message that looks like it&#8217;s from your bank. The message might say there&#8217;s been suspicious activity on your account and that you need to click on a link to verify your identity. If you do click on the link, you&#8217;ll be taken to a fake website where you&#8217;ll be asked to enter your banking information. Once the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-recognize-an-online-scammer/">scammers</a> have your login information, they have access to clean out your account.</p>
<h2>How can you protect yourself from smishing?</h2>
<p>Smishing scams can be very difficult to spot, but there are some telltale signs to look for and steps to take to protect yourself.</p>
<h3>Recognize the signs of a smishing text</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to protect yourself from smishing scams is to be able to recognize the signs of a smishing text message. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be suspicious of any text messages that ask for personal information or include a link.</li>
<li>Look closely at the sender&#8217;s name and number. Fraudulent messages often come from spoofed numbers that may look similar to a legitimate number but with one or two digits off.</li>
<li>Look for errors in spelling or grammar. This can be another sign that the message is not legitimate.</li>
<li>Beware of any text messages that create a sense of urgency or are threatening in nature. Scammers often use these tactics to get you to act quickly without thinking.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re not expecting a message from the sender, be extra cautious.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re unsure whether a text message is legitimate, call the company or organization directly to verify.</li>
</ul>

While most of us know to take precautions when online — protecting ourselves from things like phishing attacks and other cyber threats — we should also attend to our physical security.</p>
<p>One concern is tailgating — a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/social-engineering/">social engineering</a> attack where someone gets physical access to a business to take confidential information or do other harm.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect yourself from tailgating attacks, such as an unauthorized person following you into a restricted area while on the job.</p>
<h2>What is a tailgating attack?</h2>
<p>Tailgating is a type of social engineering attack where an unauthorized person gains physical access to an off-limits location — perhaps a password-protected area — where they might steal sensitive information, damage property, compromise user credentials or even <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-quickly-remove-malware-in-2022-2/">install malware on computers</a>.</p>
<p>“Piggybacking” is closely related to tailgating, but it involves consent from the duped employee. So, while a worker might be unaware that someone has tailgated them into a restricted area with piggybacking, the hacker might convince a worker to provide access because they are posing as, say, a delivery driver.</p>
<h3>Who’s at risk of tailgating attacks?</h3>
<p>Companies, particularly at risk of being targeted by tailgating scams, include those:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>With many employees, often moving inside and out of the premises</li>
<li>With multiple entrance points into a building</li>
<li>That receive deliveries of food, packages, documents, and other things regularly</li>
<li>That have many subcontractors working for them</li>
<li>Where employees aren’t thoroughly trained in physical and cybersecurity protocols</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re spending time on the web or working in the office, you want peace of mind knowing that you are in a safe environment.

So, while a worker might be unaware that someone has tailgated them into a restricted area with piggybacking, the hacker might convince a worker to provide access because they are posing as, say, a delivery driver.</p>
<h3>Who’s at risk of tailgating attacks?</h3>
<p>Companies, particularly at risk of being targeted by tailgating scams, include those:</p>
<ul>
<li>With many employees, often moving inside and out of the premises</li>
<li>With multiple entrance points into a building</li>
<li>That receive deliveries of food, packages, documents, and other things regularly</li>
<li>That have many subcontractors working for them</li>
<li>Where employees aren’t thoroughly trained in physical and cybersecurity protocols</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, companies with robust security systems in place — including using biometrics, badges, or other identity and information security measures — are better protected from tailgating and piggybacking attacks.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say that some smooth-talking fraudster can’t talk someone into letting them in or finding some way around those protections.</p>
<h3>What are common tailgating methods?</h3>
<p>Common types of tailgating attacks that you should be aware of on the job include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone walking behind you into a secure area, depending on your common courtesy to keep the door open for them</li>
<li>A courier or delivery driver who aren’t what they seem</li>
<li>A courier or delivery driver who aren’t what they seem</li>
<li>Someone with their hands full of items to trick you into opening the door for them</li>
<li>A person who claims they’ve lost their work ID or forgotten it at home, so that you grant them admittance</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to protect yourself from tailgating attacks</h2>
<p>Protecting yourself from tailgating attacks is partly a matter of learning about the issue, raising your level of awareness on the job, and depending on your employer, putting in place more effective security systems.</p>
<p>Some solutions include:</p>
<h3>Increased security training</h3>
<p>Many companies know how to train employees to recognize, avoid, and cope with online security issues but may forget to provide the same diligence to physical security. How to spot and deal with threats should be part of this training, plus cultivating an awareness of surroundings and people who might be out of place.</p>
<p>Management should offer a clearly stated security policy taught to everyone, which might insist that no one be allowed into a secure area without the proper pass or identification. As the security policy is updated, all employees should be aware of changes and additions.</p>
<p>These security measures should be part of an overall protection program, like McAfee® <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total Protection</a>, which includes antivirus software, a firewall, identity monitoring, password management, web protection, and more.</p>
<h3>Smart badges and cards</h3>
<p>If you have a large business spread over several floors, it can be hard for employees to know who works there and who doesn’t, leaving them susceptible to tailgating and piggybacking attacks. Requiring smart badges and cards to access restricted areas can help cut back on unauthorized intrusions and provide better access control.</p>
<p>Building fully staffed reception areas with dedicated security personnel could also be part of a larger security system.</p>
<h3>Biometric scanners</h3>
<p>Biometric scanners are an even more advanced way to provide proper authentication for a worker’s identity. They scan a unique physical or audible feature of a person and compare it to a database for approved personnel.</p>
<p>Examples of biometric security include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice recognition</li>
<li>Iris recognition</li>
<li>Fingerprint scans</li>
<li>Facial recognition</li>
<li>Heart-rate sensors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding social engineering</h3>
<p>One reason people are vulnerable to physical and cyberattacks is that they lack education on social engineering and the kinds of threats it poses.</p>
<p>Workers need to understand the full range of social engineering techniques and know-how to protect themselves, whether in their <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-protect-your-social-media-accounts/">social media accounts</a> or physical work environment.</p>
<p>For their part, companies can use simulated <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/">phishing emails</a> and tailgating attacks to raise awareness and underline how to follow protocols in dealing with them.</p>
<h3>Video surveillance</h3>
<p>If there are many ways to enter a business, it may make sense to put video surveillance on all entrances. Advanced video surveillance systems can use artificial intelligence (AI) and video analytics to scan the faces of people entering and compare them to a database of employee features.</p>
<h2>Discover how McAfee can help keep devices secure from hacking</h2>
<p>Whether at work or at home, people want to be secure from attacks by cybercriminals who seek to take personal information.</p>
<p>To add a layer of security to all their connected devices — including computers, smartphones, and tablets — an increasing number of people are turning to the comprehensive coverage of<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> McAfee® Total Protection</a>.</p>
<p>Features range from advanced monitoring of possible threats to your identity, automatic implementation of virtual private networks (VPNs) to deal with unsafe networks, and personal data clean-up, removing your information from high-risk data broker sites.</p>
<p>McAfee protection allows you to work and play online with greater peace of mind.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In its simplest form, your digital identity is made up of a whole host of things that can be traced back to you and who you are. That can range anywhere from photos you post online to online shopping accounts, email accounts to telephone numbers, and bank accounts to your tax ID. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In this way, your digital identity is like dozens upon dozens of puzzle pieces made up of different accounts, ID numbers, and so forth. When put together, they create a picture of you. And that’s why those little puzzle pieces of your identity are such attractive targets for hackers. If they get the right combination of them, you can end up a victim of theft or fraud. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Millennials are major targets for fraud</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s what’s happening: </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2019/10/not-what-you-think-millennials-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">people in their 20s and 30s were twice as likely than people 40 and over to report losing money while shopping online</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. That’s according to recent figures from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which also found that people in their 20s to 30s are far more likely to report losing money to fraud. What’s more, they’re also 77% more likely than older people to lose it by way of an email scam.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And it’s no surprise younger adults get targeted this way. </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/why-millennials-gen-z-use-mobile-banking-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">They’re far more likely than any other age group to use mobile apps for peer-to-peer payments, transfer money between accounts, deposit checks, and pay bills</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In short, there’s a lot of money flowing through the palms of their hands thanks to their phones, as well as their computers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself from hackers and fraud means protecting your digital identity. And that can feel like a pretty huge task given all the information your digital identity includes. It can be done, though, especially if you think about your identity like a puzzle. A piece here, another piece there, can complete the picture (or complete it just enough) to give a hacker what they need to separate you from your money. Thus, the way to stay safe is to keep those puzzle pieces out of other people’s hands. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s actually not that tough. With a few new habits and a couple of apps to help you out, you can protect yourself from the headaches and flat-out pain of fraud. Here’s a list of straightforward things that you can get started on right away:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Start with the basics—security software</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Protect yourself by protecting your stuff. Installing and using security software on your computers and phones can prevent all kinds of attacks and make you safer while you surf, bank, and shop online. I should emphasize it again—</span><i><span data-contrast="none">protect your phone.</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> Only about half of people protect their phones even though they use it to hail rides, order food, send money to friends, and more. Going unprotected on your phone means you’re sending all that money on the internet in a way that’s far, far less safe than if you use online protection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">You hear this one all the time and for good reason—</span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/?hilite=%27password%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">strong, unique passwords offer one of your best defenses against hackers.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> Never re-use them (or slight alterations of them) across the different platforms and services you use. Don’t forget to update them on the regular (that means at least every 60 days)! While that sounds like a lot of work, </span><a href="/blogs/consumer/mcafee-consumer-news/small-businesses-save-up-to-60-in-mcafee-and-visa-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a password manager can keep on top of it all for you</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. And if your platform or service offers the use of two-factor authentication, definitely make use of that. It’s a further layer of security that makes hacking tougher for crooks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Keep up to date with your updates</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Updates have a way of popping up on our phones and computers nearly every day, resist the urge to put them off until later. Aside from making improvements, updates often include important security fixes. So, when you get an alert for your operating system or app on your devices, go ahead and update. Think of it as adding another line of defense from hackers who are looking to exploit old flaws in your apps.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Think twice when you share</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Social media is one place hackers go to harvest personal information because people sometimes have a way of sharing more than they should. With info like your birthday, the name of your first school, your mother’s maiden name, or even the make of your first car, they can answer common security questions that could hack into your accounts. Crank up the privacy settings on your accounts so only friends and family can see your posts—and realize the best defense here is not to post any possibly sensitive info in the first place. Also, steer clear of those “quizzes” that sometimes pop up in your social feeds. Those are other ways that hackers try to gain bits of info that can put your identity at risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Even though so many of us have gone paperless with our bills, identity theft by digging through the trash, or “dumpster diving,” is still a thing. Things like medical bills, tax documents, and checks still might make their way to your mailbox. You’ll want to dispose of them properly when you’re through with them. First, invest in paper shredder. Once you’ve online deposited that check or paid that odd bill, shred it so that any personal or account info on there can’t be read (and can be recycled securely). Second, if you’re heading out of town for a bit, have a friend collect your mail or have the post office put a temporary hold on your mail. That’ll prevent thieves from lifting personal info right from your mailbox while you’re away.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="none">6. Check your credit</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Even if you don’t think there’s a problem, go ahead and check your credit. The thing is, someone could be charging things against your name without you even knowing it. Depending on where you live, different credit reporting agencies keep tabs on people’s credit. In the U.S., the big ones are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Also in the U.S., the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires these agencies to provide you with a free credit check at least once every 12 months. Canada, the UK, and other nations likewise offer ways to get a free credit report. Run down your options—you may be surprised by what you find.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As I just mentioned, the quickest way to get sense of what’s happening with your identity is to check your credit. Identity theft goes beyond money. Crooks will steal identities to rent apartments, access medical services, and even get jobs. Things like that can show up on a credit report, such as when an unknown address shows up in a list of your current and former residences or when a company you’ve never worked for shows up as an employer. If you spot anything strange, track it down right away. Many businesses have fraud departments with procedures in place that can help you clear your name if you find a charge or service wrongfully billed under your name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Other signs are far more obvious. You may find collection agencies calling or even see tax notices appearing in your mailbox (yikes). Clearly, cases like those are telltale signs that something is really wrong. In that case, report it right away:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Likewise, many nations offer similar government services. A quick search will point you in the right direction.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another step you can take is to ask each credit bureau to freeze your credit, which prevents crooks from using your personal information to open new lines of credit or accounts in your name. Fraud alerts offer another line of protection for you as well, and </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">you can learn more about fraud alerts here</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Keeping your digital identity in your hands</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With so many bits and pieces of information making up your digital identity, a broader way of keeping it safe involves asking yourself a question: </span><i><span data-contrast="none">what could happen if someone got their hands on this info?</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> Further realizing that even little snippets of unsecured info can lead to fraud or theft in your name helps—even that un-shredded bill or innocuous refund check for a couple of bucks could give a crook the puzzle piece they need. You can keep your digital identity safe by keeping those pieces of info out of other people’s hands.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/300x200_How-to-Tell-Whether-a-Website-Is-Safe-or-Unsafe.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/300x200_How-to-Tell-Whether-a-Website-Is-Safe-or-Unsafe.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/300x200_How-to-Tell-Whether-a-Website-Is-Safe-or-Unsafe-194x129.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>It&#8217;s important to know that not all websites are safe to visit. In fact, some sites may contain malicious software (malware) that can harm your computer or steal your personal contact information or credit card numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/">Phishing</a> is another common type of web-based attack where scammers try to trick you into giving them your personal information, and you can be susceptible to this if you visit a suspicious site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity theft</a> is a serious problem, so it&#8217;s important to protect yourself when browsing the web. Online security threats can be a big issue for internet users, especially when visiting new websites or following site links.</p>
<p>So how can you tell if you’re visiting a safe website or an unsafe website? You can use a few different methods. This page discusses key things to look for in a website so you can stay safe online.</p>
<h2>Key signs of website safety and security</h2>
<p>When you’re visiting a website, a few key indicators can help determine whether the site is safe. This section explores how to check the URL for two specific signs of a secure website.</p>
<h3>”Https:” in the website URL</h3>
<p>&#8220;Https&#8221; in a website URL indicates that the website is safe to visit. The &#8220;s&#8221; stands for “secure,” and it means that the website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect your information. A verified SSL certificate tells your browser that the website is secure. This is especially important when <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/8-ways-to-know-if-online-stores-are-safe-and-legit/">shopping online</a> or entering personal information into a website.</p>
<p>When you see &#8220;https&#8221; in a URL, the site is using a protocol that encrypts information before it&#8217;s sent from your computer to the website&#8217;s server. This helps prevent anyone from intercepting and reading your sensitive information as it&#8217;s transmitted.</p>
<h3>A lock icon near your browser’s URL field</h3>
<p>The padlock icon near your browser&#8217;s URL field is another indicator that a webpage is safe to visit. This icon usually appears in the address bar and means the site uses SSL encryption. Security tools and icon and warning appearances depend on the web browser.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the cybersecurity tools on the three major web browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/avoid-fraud-by-using-encrypted-websites-sfri40697/mac#:~:text=In%20the%20Safari%20app%20on,icon%20indicates%20a%20standard%20certificate." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safari</a>. In the Safari browser on a Mac, you can simply look for the lock icon next to the website&#8217;s URL in the address bar. The lock icon will be either locked or unlocked, depending on whether the site uses SSL encryption. If it’s an unsafe website, Safari generates a red-text warning in the address bar saying “Not Secure” or “Website Not Secure” when trying to enter information in fields meant for personal data or credit card numbers. Safari may also generate an on-page security warning stating, “Your connection is not private” or “Your connection is not secure.”</li>
<li><a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Chrome</a>. In Google Chrome, you’ll see a gray lock icon (it was green in previous Chrome versions) on the left of the URL when you’re on a site with a verified SSL certificate. Chrome has additional indicator icons, such as a lowercase “i” with a circle around it. Click this icon to read pertinent information on the site’s cybersecurity. Google Safe Browsing uses security tools to alert you when visiting an unsafe website. A red caution symbol may appear to the left of the URL saying “Not secure.” You may also see an on-page security message saying the site is unsafe due to phishing or malware.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure#:~:text=Padlock%20with%20a%20warning%20triangle,-A%20padlock%20with&amp;text=indicates%20that%20the%20connection%20between,page%20isn't%20fully%20secure." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>. Like Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox browser will tag all sites without encryption with a distinctive marker. A padlock with a warning triangle indicates that the website is only partially encrypted and may not prevent cybercriminals from eavesdropping. A padlock with a red strike over it indicates an unsafe website. If you click on a field on the website, it’ll prompt you with a text warning stating, “This connection is not secure.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>In-depth ways to check a website’s safety and security</h2>
<p>Overall, the ”https” and the locked padlock icon are good signs that your personal data will be safe when you enter it on a website. But you can ensure a website’s security is up to par in other ways. This section will explore five in-depth methods for checking website safety.</p>
<h3>Use McAfee WebAdvisor</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee WebAdvisor</a> is a free toolbar that helps keep you safe online. It works with your existing antivirus software to provide an extra layer of protection against online threats. WebAdvisor also blocks unsafe websites and lets you know if a site is known for phishing or other malicious activity. In addition, it can help you avoid online scams and prevent you from accidentally downloading malware. Overall, McAfee WebAdvisor is a useful tool that can help you stay safe while browsing the web.</p>
<h3>Website trust seals</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re browsing the web, it&#8217;s important to be able to trust the websites you&#8217;re visiting. One way to determine if a website is trustworthy is to look for trust seals. Trust seals are logos or badges that indicate a website is safe and secure. They usually appear on the homepage or checkout page of a website.</p>
<p>There are many types of trust seals, but some of the most common include the Better Business Bureau (BBB) seal, VeriSign secure seal, and the McAfee secure seal. These seals indicate that a third-party organization has verified the website as safe and secure.</p>
<p>While trust seals can help determine whether a website is trustworthy, it&#8217;s important to remember that they are not foolproof. Website owners can create a fake trust seal, so it&#8217;s always important to do your own research to ensure a website is safe before entering personal information.</p>
<h3>Check for a privacy policy</h3>
<p>Another way to determine if a website is safe to visit is to check for a privacy policy. A privacy policy is a document that outlines how a website collects and uses personal information. It should also state how the site protects your data from being accessed or shared by <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-recognize-an-online-scammer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scammers</a>, hackers, or other unauthorized individuals.</p>
<p>If a website doesn&#8217;t have a privacy policy, that&#8217;s a red flag that you shouldn&#8217;t enter any personal information on the site. Even if a website does have a privacy policy, it&#8217;s important to read it carefully so you understand how the site uses your personal data.</p>
<h3>Check third-party reviews</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to do some preliminary research before visiting a new website, especially if you&#8217;re shopping online or entering personal data like your address, credit card, or phone number. One way to determine if a website is safe and trustworthy is to check third-party reviews. Several websites provide reviews of other websites, so you should be able to find several reviews for any given site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trustpilot</a> is one example of a website that provides reviews of other websites.Look for common themes when reading reviews. If most of the reviews mention that a website is safe and easy to use, it&#8217;s likely that the site is indeed safe to visit. However, if a lot of negative reviews mention problems with viruses or malware, you might want to avoid the site.</p>
<h3>Look over the website design</h3>
<p>You can also analyze the website design when deciding whether a website is safe to visit. Look for spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and anything that appears off. If a website looks like it was made in a hurry or doesn&#8217;t seem to be well-designed, that&#8217;s usually a red flag that the site might not be safe.</p>
<p>Be especially careful of websites that have a lot of pop-ups. These sites are often spammy or contain malware. Don&#8217;t download anything from a website unless you&#8217;re absolutely sure it&#8217;s safe. These malicious websites rarely show up on the top of search engine results, so consider using a search engine to find what you&#8217;re looking for rather than a link that redirects you to an unknown website.</p>
<h2>Download McAfee WebAdvisor for free and stay safe while browsing</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure whether a website is safe to visit, download McAfee WebAdvisor for free. McAfee WebAdvisor is a program that helps protect you from online threats, such as malware and viruses. It also blocks pop-ups and other intrusive ads so you can browse the web without worry. Plus, it&#8217;s completely free to download and use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser/mcafee-webadvisor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download McAfee WebAdvisor</a> now and stay safe while browsing the web.</p>

If you&#8217;re not too interested in that particular result, you may simply move on to another result option. But if you&#8217;re tempted to visit the site anyway, you should be sure you understand what the warning means, what the risks are, and how to bypass the error if you need to.</p>
<h2>What does “this connection is not private” mean?</h2>
<p>A “your connection is not private” error means that your browser cannot determine with certainty that a website has safe encryption protocols in place to protect your device and data. You can bump into this error on any device connected to the internet — computer, smartphone, or tablet.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is going on when you see the &#8220;this connection is not private” error?</p>
<p>For starters, it&#8217;s important to know that seeing the error is just a warning, and it does not mean any of your private information is compromised. A “your connection is not private” error means the website you were trying to visit does not have an up-to-date SSL (secure sockets layer) security certificate.</p>
<p>Website owners must maintain the licensing regularly to ensure the site encryption capabilities are up to date. If the website&#8217;s SSL certificate is outdated, it means the site owners have not kept their encryption licensing current, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they are up to no good. Even major websites like LinkedIn have had momentary lapses that would throw the error. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/30/linkedin_ssl_certificates_expire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> mistakenly let their subdomain SSL certificates lapse.</p>
<p>In late 2021, a significant provider of SSL certificates, Let&#8217;s Encrypt, went out of business. When their root domain officially lapsed, it created issues for many domain names and SSL certificates owned by legitimate companies. The privacy error created problems for unwitting businesses, as many of their website visitors were rightfully concerned about site security.</p>
<p>While it does not always mean a website is unsafe to browse, it should not be ignored. A secure internet connection is critical to protecting yourself online. Many nefarious websites are dangerous to visit, and this SSL certificate error will protect you from walking into them unaware.</p>
<p>SL certification standards have helped make the web a safer place to transact. It helps ensure online activities like paying bills online, ordering products, connecting to online banking, or keeping your private email accounts safe and secure. Online security continues to improve with a new Transport Layer Security (TLS) standard, which promises to be the successor protocol to SSL.</p>
<p>So be careful whenever visiting sites that trigger the &#8220;connection is not private&#8221; error, as those sites can potentially make your personal data less secure and make your devices vulnerable to viruses and malware.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &#8220;your connection is not private&#8221; error is Google Chrome&#8217;s phrasing. Microsoft Edge or Mozilla Firefox users will instead see a &#8220;your connection is not secure&#8221; error as the warning message.</p>
<h2>How to fix the “connection is not private” error</h2>
<p>If you feel confident that a website or page is safe, despite the warning from your web browser, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the error.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Refresh the page.</strong> In some cases, the error is just a momentary glitch. Try reloading the page to rule out a temporary error.</li>
<li><strong>Close browser and reopen.</strong> Closing and reopening your web browser might also help clear a temporary glitch.</li>
<li><strong>If you&#8217;re on public WiFi, think twice.</strong> Hackers often exploit public WiFi because their routers are usually not as secure or well maintained for security. Some public WiFi networks may not have an SSL connection, or they may limit your access to websites. You can safely browse more securely in public spaces if you have an antivirus software or <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-to-set-up-a-vpn/">virtual private network</a> (VPN) solution.</li>
<li><strong>Use &#8220;Incognito&#8221; mode.</strong> The most used browsers (Google Chrome browser, Mac&#8217;s Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge) offer an &#8220;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-incognito-mode-and-how-safe-is-it/">Incognito mode</a>&#8221; that lets you browse without data collecting in your history or cache. Open the site in a new incognito window and see if the error still appears.</li>
<li><strong>Clear the cache on your browser.</strong> While cookies make browsing the web more convenient and personalized, they also can hold on to sensitive information. Hackers will take advantage of cached data to try and get passwords, purchase information, and anything else they can exploit. Clear browsing data before going to a site with the &#8220;connection is not secure&#8221; error to help limit available data for hackers.</li>
<li><strong>Check the computer&#8217;s date and time.</strong> If you frequently see the &#8220;connection is not private&#8221; error, you should check and ensure your computer has the accurate time and date. Your computer&#8217;s clock can sometimes have time and date stamp issues and get glitchy in multiple ways. If it&#8217;s incorrect, adjust the date and set the time to the correct settings.</li>
<li><strong>Check your antivirus software.</strong> If your antivirus software is sensitive, you may have to disable it momentarily to bypass the error. Antivirus software protects you, so you should be careful to remember to turn the software back on again after you&#8217;ve bypassed the error.</li>
<li><strong>Be sure your browsers and operating systems are up to date.</strong> You should always keep your critical software and the operating system fully updated. An outdated browser can start getting buggy and can increase the occurrence of this kind of error.</li>
<li><strong>Research the website.</strong> Do a quick search for the company of the website you wish to visit and make sure they are a legitimate business. You can search for reviews, Better Business Bureau ratings, or check for forums to see if others are having the same issue. Be sure you are spelling the website address correctly and that you have the correct URL for the site. Hackers can take advantage of misspellings or alternative URLs to try and snare users looking for trusted brands.</li>
<li><strong>If it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s them.</strong> If you&#8217;ve tried all the troubleshooting techniques above and you still see the error, the problem is likely coming from the site itself. If you&#8217;re willing to take your chances (after clearing your browser&#8217;s cache), you can click the option to &#8220;proceed to the domain,&#8221; though it is not recommended. You may have to choose “advanced settings” and click again to visit the site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you are taking your chances anytime you ignore an error. As we mentioned, you could leave yourself vulnerable to hackers after your passwords, personal information, and other risks.</p>
<h2>How to protect your privacy when browsing online</h2>
<p>Your data and private information are valuable to hackers, so they will continue to find new ways to try and procure it. Here are some ways to protect yourself and your data when browsing online.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antivirus solutions</strong> are, hands down, your best line of protection against hacking. Solutions like <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee+ Ultimate</a> offer all the tools you need to secure your data and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Use strong passwords</strong> and two-factor authentication when available.</li>
<li><strong>Delete unused browser extensions</strong> (or phone apps) to reduce access.</li>
<li><strong>Always keep your operating system and browsers up-to-date</strong>. You can open system preferences and choose to update your system automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Use a secure VPN solution</strong> to shield your data when browsing.</li>
<li><strong>Use your favorite browser&#8217;s incognito mode</strong> to reduce the data connected to your devices.</li>
<li><strong>Remove any 3rd party apps from your social media</strong> accounts — especially if you&#8217;ve recently taken a Facebook quiz or similar (also, don&#8217;t take Facebook quizzes).</li>
<li><strong>Engage the highest privacy settings</strong> in each of your browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Always check the address bar for HTTPS</strong> before sharing credit cards or other sensitive data on a website.</li>
<li><strong>Share less personal and private information</strong> on social media.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cybercriminals are always after illegal advertising revenue. As we have previously <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/new-hiddenads-malware-that-runs-automatically-and-hides-on-google-play-1m-users-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, we have seen many mobile malwares masquerading as a useful tool or utility, and automatically crawling ads in the background. Recently the McAfee Mobile Research Team has identified new Clicker malware that sneaked into Google Play. In total 16 applications that were previously on Google Play have been confirmed to have the malicious payload with an assumed 20 million installations.</p>
<p>McAfee security researchers notified Google and all of the identified apps are no longer available on Google Play. Users are also protected by Google Play Protect, which blocks these apps on Android. McAfee Mobile Security products detect this threat as Android/Clicker and protect you from malware.

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>The malicious code was found on useful utility applications like Flashlight (Torch), QR readers, Camara, Unit converters, and Task managers:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-160935 aligncenter" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx.png" alt="" width="493" height="682" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx.png 493w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx-217x300.png 217w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx-93x129.png 93w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160921" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx2.png" alt="" width="588" height="690" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx2.png 588w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx2-256x300.png 256w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dx2-110x129.png 110w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>
<p>Once the application is opened, it downloads its remote configuration by executing an HTTP request. After the configuration is downloaded, it registers the FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) listener to receive push messages. At first glance, it seems like well-made android software. However, it is hiding ad fraud features behind, armed with remote configuration and FCM techniques.</p>

<p>The FCM message has various types of information and that includes which function to call and its parameters. The picture below shows some of FCM message history:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160893" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/table.png" alt="" width="300" height="287" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/table.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/table-135x129.png 135w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/table-24x24.png 24w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>When an FCM message receives and meets some condition, the latent function starts working. Mainly, it is visiting websites which are delivered by FCM message and browsing them successively in the background while mimicking user’s behavior. This may cause heavy network traffic and consume power without user awareness during the time it generates profit for the threat actor behind this malware. In the picture below there is an example of the network traffic generated to get the information required to generate fake clicks and the websites visited without user’s consent or interaction:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160879" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list.png" alt="" width="1045" height="551" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list.png 1045w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list-300x158.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list-1024x540.png 1024w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list-768x405.png 768w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/list-205x108.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 1045px) 100vw, 1045px" /></p>
<h1>Malicious components: CAS and LivePosting</h1>
<p>So far, we have identified two pieces of code related to this threat. One is “com.click.cas” library which focuses on the automated clicking functionality while “com.liveposting” library works as an agent and runs hidden adware services:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160865" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/folders.png" alt="" width="358" height="208" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/folders.png 358w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/folders-300x174.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/folders-205x119.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /></p>
<p>Depending on the version of the applications, some have both libraries working together while other applications only have “com.liveposting” library. The malware is using installation time, random delay and user presence to avoid the users from noticing these malicious acts. The malicious behavior won’t start if the installation time is within an hour and during the time the user is using the device, probably to stay under the radar and avoid being detected right away:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160851" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/losts-of-code.png" alt="" width="517" height="205" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/losts-of-code.png 517w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/losts-of-code-300x119.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/losts-of-code-205x81.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Clicker malware targets illicit advertising revenue and can disrupt the mobile advertising ecosystem. Malicious behavior is cleverly hidden from detection. Malicious actions such as retrieving crawl URL information via FCM messages start in the background after a certain period of time and are not visible to the user.</p>
<p>McAfee Mobile Security detects and removes malicious applications like this one that may run in the background without user’s knowledge. Also, we recommend having a security software installed and activated so you will be notified of any mobile threats present on your device in a timely manner. Once you remove this and other malicious applications, you can expect an extended battery time and you will notice reduced mobile data usage while ensuring that your sensitive and personal data is protected from this and other types of threats.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Toyota says the breach is the result of a subcontractor posting source code for Toyota’s “T-Connect” app on the software development platform GitHub in December 2017. This code included an access key to the data server that hosted the e-mail addresses and customer management numbers of T-Connect users. The publicly available source code was found on September 15</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none">, 2022, at which time Toyota changed the access key.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Toyota customers affected by this data breach include T-Connect users who registered their email on the Toyota T-Connect site since July 2017.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to Toyota’s announcement and apology no other personal information such as customer names, phone numbers, and credit cards were affected. (Note that this announcement was </span><a href="https://company.toyotaconnected.co.jp/news/press/2022/1007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">published in Japanese—you can use your browser to translate</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The company further could not confirm whether this information was in fact accessed. However, the company could not deny the possibility that it was at some point during that five-year period.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Toyota said that it will individually send an apology and notification to the registered email address of any customer whose information may have been leaked.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">I’m a Toyota owner. What should I do about the Toyota T-Connect data leak?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Any time a data breach occurs, it means that your personal information could end up in the hands of a bad actor. Different pieces of personal information can be more useful to them than others. Some are directly useful, such as a Social Security Number or credit card information because they uniquely identify you. Others are indirectly helpful, like device IDs, browsing history, geolocation information, and internet protocol addresses. On their own, such information will not uniquely identify you. Yet with enough indirect information, and in the right combination, a bad actor could use them to piece together your identity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In light of this, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself in the aftermath of a data breach, which involves a combination of preventative steps and some monitoring on your part.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Keep an eye out for phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that email addresses may have been compromised, Toyota specifically warned its customers about the possibility of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing attacks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and other unsolicited emails that may contain malware or links to malicious sites. While it’s always wise to keep a skeptical eye open for unsolicited messages that ask you for information or that contain attachments you weren’t expecting, it’s particularly important after breaches. If you receive such emails, delete them, and don’t click on any links or attachments. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Also note that bad actors may launch phishing attacks where they pose as Toyota, all with the aim to steal personal information. Such emails can clearly look like a scam, such as when they include typos, grammatical errors, or sloppy graphics. Others can look far more sophisticated, almost like a legitimate email. Learning how to tell the two apart can take a little skill, and you can check out this quick read so you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/protect-yourself-against-phishing-scams-with-these-security-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">spot and protect yourself from phishing scams</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Consider using comprehensive online protection</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A complete suite of online protection software can offer layers of extra security</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In addition to more private and secure time online with a VPN, identity monitoring, and password management, it includes web browser protection that can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a phishing scam—which antivirus protection can’t do alone. Additionally, we offer $1M identity theft coverage and support from a recovery pro, just in case.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Change your passwords and use a password manager</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As far as passwords go, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">strong and unique passwords are best</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, which means never reusing your passwords across different sites and platforms. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Using a password manager</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> will help you keep on top of it all, while also storing your passwords securely.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Moreover, changing your passwords regularly may make a stolen password worthless because it’s out of date.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because so many accounts use an email address as the username, and because email addresses were exposed in the Toyota leak, updating your passwords across your accounts can provide an extra level of protection.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Enable two-factor authentication</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While a strong and unique password is a good first line of defense, enabling two-factor authentication across your accounts will help your cause by providing an added layer of security. It’s increasingly common to see nowadays, where banks and all manner of online services will only allow access to your accounts after you’ve provided a one-time passcode sent to your email or smartphone. If your accounts support two-factor authentication, enable it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Consider using identity monitoring</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-monitoring?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">An identity monitoring service</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can monitor everything from email addresses to IDs and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft.​ Personal information harvested from data breaches can end up on dark web marketplaces where it’s bought by other bad actors so they can launch their own attacks. McAfee’s monitors the dark web for your personal info and provides early alerts if your data is found on there, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​ We also provide guidance to help you act if your information is found.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Clean up your personal data online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As mentioned earlier, information stolen in a data breach may indirectly identify you. Yet when pieced together with other information, it can then directly identify you. Cad actors can complete this identity picture puzzle with information provided by data brokers that buy and sell personal information online. However, you can take some control over this. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html#:~:text=Personal%20Data%20Clean%20Up?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">Our </span></a><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup service scans high-risk data broker sites for your personal information</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and then helps you remove it—which denies bad actors the information they may need to commit identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Staying Safe in the Wake of the Toyota Data Leak</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your personal information gets caught up in a data leak or breach, take the steps to protect yourself. Should that information get into the hands of bad actors, it could lead to follow-on attacks such as phishing attempts, account hacks, and, in extreme cases, identity crime.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Further, as in the case of Toyota, it can take months or even years for companies to discover leaks and breaches. From there, it can take yet longer before a company announces the leak or breach. Together, that leaves bad actors with plenty of opportunity to commit all kinds of identity crime in the meantime. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Because of this, taking preventative steps to secure and monitor your identity can help protect you from harm—even if your information wasn’t involved in an attack. With data leaks and breaches of all sizes now commonplace, a proactive stance offers far better protection than reactionary measures taken after the fact.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

One that they don’t need every piece to solve. They only need a few bits to do their dirty work, which means protecting every piece you put out there—a sort of holistic view on your personal security. One that protects you, not just your devices.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s what’s at stake: we create and share loads of personal information simply by going about our day online, where each bit of information makes up a piece of that giant jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces directly identify us, like our tax returns, bank account information, or driver’s licenses. Other pieces of information indirectly identify us, like the IP addresses assigned to our computers, tablets, and phones—or device ID numbers, location information, and browsing history. And bad actors only need a few key pieces to do you harm, such as committing identity crime in your name or selling your personal information on sketchy websites or the dark web.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While people show great concern about their personal information, who has it and what’s done with it, our research shows that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/#:~:text=Why%20Personal%20Data%20Cleanup%20matters?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">70% of people feel like they have little or no control over the data that’s collected about them</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. However, you have plenty of ways that you can indeed take control—ways that can prevent, detect, and correct attacks on your privacy and identity. That’s where holistic protection comes in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What do we mean by holistic protection?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can think of holistic protection as layers of shields that protect you and the devices you use. It gives you three layers in all—a Prevention Layer, Detection Layer, and a Correction Layer.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A holistic and comprehensive security solution like McAfee+ combines those three layers in a way that protects your personal information and keep your identity private, showing you how it does it along the way, so you can see exactly how safe you are. Let’s take a quick look of some of the protections you’ll find in each layer …</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

But this is just what crooks and scammers do without our knowledge using “spyware.”</p>
<p>Spyware is a piece of software that can covertly gather information on you. It can track the websites you visit and even record what you type on your keyboard, including passwords and credit card numbers.</p>
<p>So, now the bad guys don’t have to steal your wallet to get access to your personal and financial information. All they need to do is trick you into installing spyware on your computer or device. Or they could install it themselves on public or shared computers using a USB drive, or similar device.</p>
<p>One of the more common forms of spyware found on shared computers is called a “keylogger.” It can record everything you type and send it back to the cybercrook. That’s why you should avoid using shared computers in hotels or public libraries, since they can be easily compromised.<br />
Most spyware masquerades as legitimate software, such as free games or mobile apps. In fact, researchers believe that over three years, 1 million Google Play users downloaded a single piece of spyware alone. It appeared to be an official “<a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/android-spyware-google-play-store-downloaded-1-million-times-3-years/">System Update</a>” application, but actually monitored the users’ location information and text messages without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Spyware can also easily spread online in the form of dangerous links in emails, and on social media or torrent sites, which offer free access to online content. That’s why you need to be careful where you click.</p>
<p>Another common form of spyware is called “adware.” Adware is used to display advertisements on your computer, or redirect your search inquiries to an advertiser&#8217;s website. Although this isn&#8217;t as harmful as spyware designed to steal your information, it is still invasive and annoying.</p>
<p>Since spyware is so prevalent and potentially harmful, putting both your private information and privacy at risk, it’s important that you take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Here are some tips to keep you safe:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Only visit trusted websites and be suspicious of sites offering “free” content or applications.</li>
<li>Be careful when downloading any software or mobile apps from the web. Read other users’ reviews first to make sure the product is safe. Also, read any licensing or service agreements carefully to see if the provider is accessing more information than it needs to.</li>
<li>Never leave your computer or devices unattended in public, since a cybercrook could potentially install spyware when you’re not looking.</li>
<li>Avoid clicking on online ads, since they could lead to adware.</li>
<li>Look out for anti-spyware scams. There are many phony “anti-spyware” tools online that offer free scans. They falsely detect multiple spyware programs on your computer to get you to buy their product.</li>
<li>Make sure you use <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs">comprehensive security</a> software that includes spyware protection, and keep it up-to-date.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like anything else we own, those things can be passed along through our estates too.</p>
<p>With the explosion of digital media, commerce, and even digital currency too, there’s a very good chance you have thousands of dollars of digital assets in your possession. For example, we can look at <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110927005661/en/McAfee-Reveals-Average-Internet-User-Has-More-Than-37000-in-Underprotected-%E2%80%98Digital-Assets%E2%80%99#:~:text=The%20Financial%20and%20Emotional%20Value%20of%20Digital%20Assets&amp;text=As%20a%20global%20average%2C%20respondents,a%20total%20value%20of%20%2437%2C438." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research we conducted in 2011 which found that people placed an average value of $37,438 on the digital assets they owned at the time</a>. Now, with the growth of streaming services, digital currency, cloud storage, and more in the past ten years, that figure feels conservative.</p>
<p>Enter the notion of a digital legacy, the way you can catalog and prepare your digital assets for passing through your estate.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting started with estate planning for your digital assets</strong></h3>
<p>Like so many aspects of digital life nowadays, estate planning law has started to catch up to the realities that attorneys, executors, and heirs face when dealing with an estate and its digital assets. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.retirementwatch.com/time-to-update-your-digital-assets-estate-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new laws are rolling out that address how digital assets are treated when the owner passes away</a>. For example, they give fiduciaries (like an estate executor, trustee, or an agent under a power of attorney) the right to manage a person’s digital assets if they already have the right to manage a person’s tangible assets. Such laws continue to evolve, and they can vary from state to state here in the U.S.</p>
<p>With that in mind, nothing offered in this article is legal advice, nor should it be construed as such. For legal advice, you can and should turn to your estate attorney for counsel on the best approach for you and the laws in your area. However, consider this article as a sort of checklist that can help you with your estate planning.</p>
<p>My hope is that this article will open your eyes to the digital value you have to pass along, both real and sentimental, and help you prepare your estate accordingly for the ones you care about.</p>
<h3><strong>What are digital assets in a will?</strong></h3>
<p>The best answer you can get to this question will come from your legal counsel. However, for purposes of discussion, a digital asset is any text or media in digital form that has value and offers the bearer with the right to use it.</p>
<p>To frame it up in everyday terms, let’s look at some real-world examples of digital assets that quickly come to mind. They include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo libraries</li>
<li>eBook libraries</li>
<li>Digital movies</li>
<li>Digital music</li>
<li>Digital currency, such as bitcoin</li>
<li>Air miles</li>
<li>Hotel points</li>
</ul>
<p>However, digital assets can readily expand to further include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscriptions to streaming services and online publications</li>
<li>Online game accounts—and in-game items associated with them</li>
<li>Currency stored in online payment platforms</li>
<li>Online storefronts, such as eBay, Etsy, or business websites</li>
<li>Website domain names, whether in use or held speculatively for later resale</li>
<li>Documents kept in cloud storage, like financial documents and ancestry research</li>
</ul>
<p>And as far as your estate is concerned, you can also consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online banking and financial accounts</li>
<li>Email accounts</li>
<li>Chatrooms and message boards for your interests and hobbies</li>
<li>Medical and insurance accounts</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Utility accounts</li>
<li>And any other similar accounts that may help your executor manage your estate</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s quite the list, and it’s not entirely comprehensive, either.</p>
<h3><strong>Start with an inventory of your digital assets</strong></h3>
<p>The process of lining up your digital assets begins just like any other aspect of estate planning, by listing all the digital assets and accounts you own. From there, you can see what you have and what you’d like to distribute—and what you can distribute. In fact, when it comes to digital, there are some things you simply can’t pass along. Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h4><strong>What digital assets can you pass along through your will?</strong></h4>
<p>Generally speaking, digital assets that you own can be passed along. “Own” is the operative word here. Many digital things we have are in fact licensed to us, which are not transferrable. More on that next, yet examples of things you can likely transfer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds kept in an online payment account like PayPal or Venmo.</li>
<li>Funds due to you via an online store you maintain.</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency, like bitcoin.</li>
<li>Digital music that you’ve purchased and own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your legal counsel to ensure you’re following the letter of the law in your region, and also look into any licensing agreements you may have for items like internet domain names and airline miles that you may hold to determine if they are in fact transferrable.</p>
<h4><strong>What digital assets are non-transferrable through your will?</strong></h4>
<p>This is an important topic. As mentioned above, some accounts you hold are simply licensed to you and you alone. Thus, they will not transfer. Two of the biggest examples are social media and email accounts. This can have serious repercussions if you do not leave specific instructions as to how those accounts should be handled after your passing.</p>
<p>For example, do you want your social media profiles to remain online as a memorial or do you want them simply to shut down? Note that different social media platforms have different policies for handling the accounts of users who have passed away. For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1017717331640041/about-memorialized-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook allows for creating memorialized accounts that allow friends and families to continue sharing memories</a>. Policies vary, so check with your social media platforms of choice for specifics.</p>
<p>Likewise, will your executor need access to your email account to handle affairs of the estate? And what about access to online accounts for paying bills and then ultimately closing those accounts? In all, these are points of discussion to have with an experienced estate attorney who knows the law in your region.</p>
<p>Other things to be aware of are that subscriptions to streaming accounts are likely non-transferrable as well. Often, eBooks and digital publications you own are only licensed to you as the sole owner and can’t be transferred. Again, check the agreements associated with items like these and have a talk with your attorney about them to determine what can and can’t be done with them.</p>
<h3><strong>Blogs and online communities</strong></h3>
<p>Another aspect of your digital legacy is your voice. If you’re a blogger or a participant in an online community, you may wish for a fiduciary or family member to leave a farewell post. Additionally, in the case of a blog, you may want to set up some means for your work to stay online or get archived in some manner. Again, you can work with your attorney to leave specific instructions as to what should be said and then what should be done with the blog or site in question.</p>
<h3><strong>Giving your executor access to your digital assets</strong></h3>
<p>I have a real-life example of why this is so vital. A friend of mine lost the photos of her and her husband because they were kept in an online storage account to which she had no access. And sadly, the company would not grant her access after his passing. This is often the case with many online accounts and services. Legally speaking, while the deceased may have owned the storage account and the media kept within it, the cloud storage company owns the servers on which that media is stored. The potential difficulty here is that the online service provider may view giving your personal representatives access to your account as a breach of their privacy policy or user agreements.</p>
<p>One way you can avoid heartbreak like this is to discuss giving your executor access to your accounts. This can be provided through a list of accounts, usernames, and passwords that are kept in a sealed letter along with your will, along with instructions that outline your wishes. This is important: a will is public record after you pass away. You won’t want info like usernames and passwords getting out there. Again, you can discuss an option such as this with your attorney.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting your digital assets</strong></h3>
<p>One thing you can do today that can protect your digital assets for the long haul is to use <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive security protection</a>. Far more than just antivirus, comprehensive security can store precious and important files securely with encryption, arm all your online accounts with strong passwords, and protect your identity as well. Features like these will help you see to it that your digital legacy is secure.</p>
<h3><strong>Make a plan</strong></h3>
<p>When I’ve brought up the idea of a digital legacy with friends, a light goes on in their head. “Of course, that makes a lot of sense.” It’s easy to take our digital possessions somewhat for granted, perhaps in a way that we simply don’t with our physical possessions. Yet as you can see, there’s a good chance that you indeed have a digital legacy to pass along. By getting organized now, you can see to it that your wishes are followed, and I hope this checklist helps you get started.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Who hails a taxi anymore? These days, city streets are full of double-parked sedans with their hazards on, looking for their charges. Uber is synonymous with ridesharing and has made it so far into our culture that it’s not just a company name but a verb. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Uber’s reputation has ebbed and flowed since its creation in 2009, and it’s taken another hit recently as more details are coming to light about a massive 2016 cybersecurity breach and the chief security officer’s attempts to cover it up. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Happened in the 2016 Uber Breach?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2016, a ransomware group trawled the internet and gathered Uber’s credentials that opened the door into the company’s server database. The cybercriminals then stole the information of customers and drivers alike and held it for a $100,000 Bitcoin ransom. Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer at the time, paid the ransom and the criminal group agreed to delete the information they uncovered. While it’s not uncommon for large corporations to give in to cybercriminals and dole out huge ransom payments, Sullivan is facing potential jail time because he didn’t report the incident to the Federal Trade Commission. He was recently found guilty of wire fraud and concealing a felony from authorities. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Uber account holders had their personally identifiable information in nefarious hands without their knowledge. The cybercriminals allegedly downloaded the names, email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million Uber customers and drivers, plus the license plate numbers of 600,000 drivers.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why It’s Important for Companies to Report Leaks</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Organizations have a responsibility to their customers to report any cyberbreaches. With a full name, email address, and phone number, cybercriminals can inflict a lot of damage on an innocent person’s credit, steal money from online accounts, or invade someone’s digital privacy. Customers must act swiftly to put the proper safeguards in place, but they can’t do that if they don’t even know a breach has happened! The longer a cybercriminal has to poke and prod someone’s digital footprint, the more havoc they can wreak and profits they can gain.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to Protect Your Personal Information Before and After a Breach </span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Acting swiftly is key to keeping your </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) private after a breach, though there are a few measures you can take right now that could prevent your information from being compromised. Here’s what you can do before and after a breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Preventive measures</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to shrink your attack surface – or the number of possible entry points into your digital life – is to regularly </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/dont-let-old-accounts-haunt-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">vet your online accounts and apps</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. For example, when you’re cleaning your closet, it’s common to donate or trash any clothing you haven’t worn in a year. The same method works for your digital life. If you haven’t logged into a shopping site or mobile gaming app in over a year, it’s unlikely that you will use them anytime soon, so it’s time to say goodbye and delete it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/credit-lock-and-credit-freeze-which-service-is-best-for-you-both/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee credit lock and security freeze</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> are other preventive measures that can keep your credit safe in case your PII is ever compromised. These services make it easy to prevent one or all three major credit bureaus from accessing your credit. In turn, this prevents anyone other than you from opening a bank account, applying for a loan, or making a substantial purchase. If you’re not planning on needing a credit report, it’s a great practice to freeze your credit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reactive measures</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you first hear of a company’s data leak with which you have an account, the first step you should take is to change your account password. Login and password combinations are often compromised in a data breach. Make sure your new password is strong and is not a duplicate of a password you use elsewhere.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Next, consider running a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/introducing-personal-data-cleanup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> scan. Personal Data Cleanup checks risky data broker sites and alerts you if your information appears on any of them. From there, you can take steps to remove your information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Finally, for the next few weeks, keep close tabs on your financial, online, and email accounts. Watch for suspicious activities like purchases you didn’t make, electronic receipts, notifications, or mailing lists that you didn’t sign up for. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee+ Ultimate</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can help you here with its identity monitoring and full-service Personal Data Cleanup. McAfee+ gives you a partner to alert you and help you recover if your digital privacy is compromised.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Constant Vigilance and Digital Confidence-Boosting Assets</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting your identity and digital privacy is a two-way street. While identity and privacy protection tools go a long way, individuals also have a responsibility to remain vigilant and take quick action if they suspect their information is compromised. And the ultimate responsibility lies with companies to alert the authorities and their customers after a data leak and to take serious steps to shore up their security to make sure it never happens again.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/300x200_Blog_PII-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p><span data-contrast="none">Seems like the internet follows us wherever we go nowadays, whether it tags along via a smartphone, laptop, tablet, a wearable, or some combination of them all. Yet there’s something else that follows us around as well—our PII, a growing body of “personally identifiable information” that we create while banking, shopping, and simply browsing the internet. And no doubt about it, our PII is terrifically valuable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What makes it so valuable? It’s no exaggeration to say that your PII is the key to your digital life, along with your financial and civic life as well. Aside from using it to create accounts and logins, it’s further tied to everything from your bank accounts and credit cards to your driver’s license and your tax refund. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Needless to say, your PII is something that needs protecting, so let’s take a look at several ways you can do just that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is PII?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">What is PII? It’s information about you that others can use to identify you either directly or indirectly. Thus, that info could identify you on its own, or it could identify you when it’s linked to other identifiers, like the ones associated with the devices, apps, tools, and protocols you use. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A prime example of direct PII is your tax ID number because it’s unique and directly associated with your name. Further instances include your facial image to unlock your smartphone, your medical records, your finances, and your phone number because each of these can be easily linked back to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Then there are those indirect pieces of PII that act as helpers. While they may not identify you on their own, a few of them can when they’re added together. These helpers include things like internet protocol addresses, the unique device ID of your smartphone, or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can also find pieces of your PII in the accounts you use, like your Google to Apple IDs, which can be linked to your name, your email address, and the apps you have. You’ll also find it in the apps you use. For example, there’s PII in the app you use to map your walks and runs, because the combination of your smartphone’s unique device ID and GPS tracking can be used in conjunction with other information to identify who you are, not to mention where you typically like to do your 5k hill days. The same goes for messenger apps, which can collect how you interact with others, how often you use the app and your location information based on your IP address, GPS information, or both.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In all, there’s a cloud of PII that follows us around as we go about our day online. Some wisps of that cloud are more personally identifying than others. Yet gather enough of it and PII can create a high-resolution snapshot of you—who you are, what you’re doing when you’re doing it, and even where you’re doing it too—particularly if it gets into the wrong hands.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Remember Pig-Pen, the character straight from the old funny pages of Charles Schultz’s Charlie Brown? He’s hard to forget with that ever-present cloud of dust following him around. Charlie Brown once said, “He may be carrying the soil that trod upon by Solomon or Nebuchadnezzar or Genghis Khan!” It’s the same with us and our PII, except the cloud surrounding us, isn’t the dust of kings and conquerors, they’re motes of digital information that are of tremendously high value to crooks and bad actors—whether for purposes of identity theft or invasion of privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your PII protects your identity and privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With all PII we create and share on the internet, that calls for protecting it. Otherwise, our PII could fall into the hands of a hacker or identity thief and end up getting abused, in potentially painful and costly ways.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Here are several things you can do to help ensure that what’s private stays that way:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Use a complete security platform that can also protect your privacy</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Square One is to </span><span data-contrast="auto">protect your devices with </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection software</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. This will defend you against the latest virus, malware, spyware, and ransomware attacks plus further protect your privacy and identity. In addition to this, it can also provide strong password protection by generating and automatically storing complex passwords to keep your credentials safer from hackers and crooks who may try to force their way into your accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Further, security software can also include a firewall that blocks unwanted traffic from entering your home network, such as an attacker poking around for network vulnerabilities so that they can “break-in” to your computer and steal information. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Use a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Also known as a virtual private network, a VPN helps protect your vital PII and other data with bank-grade encryption. The VPN encrypts your internet connection to keep your online activity private on any network, even public networks. Using a public network without a VPN can increase your cybersecurity risk because others on the network can potentially spy on your browsing and activity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re new to the notion of using a VPN, check out this article on </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/are-you-still-on-the-fence-about-a-family-vpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">VPNs and how to choose one</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> so that you can get the best protection and privacy possible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3) Keep a close grip on your Social Security Number</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the U.S., the Social Security Number (SSN) is one of the most prized pieces of PII as it unlocks the door to employment, finances, and much more. First up, keep a close grip on it. Literally. Store your card in a secure location. Not your purse or wallet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Certain businesses and medical practices may ask you for your SSN for billing purposes and the like. You don’t have to provide it (although some businesses could refuse service if you don’t), and you can always ask if they will accept some alternative form of information. However, there are a handful of instances where an SSN is a requirement.

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Be aware that hackers often get a hold of SSNs because the organization holding that information gets hacked or compromised itself. Minimizing how often you provide your SSN can offer an extra degree of protection.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4) Protect your files</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your files with encryption is a core concept in data and information security, and thus it’s a powerful way to protect your PII. It involves transforming data or information into code that requires a digital key to access it in its original, unencrypted format. For example, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> includes File Lock, which is our file encryption feature that lets you lock important files in secure digital vaults on your device.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Additionally, you can also delete sensitive files with an application such as McAfee Shredder<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, which securely deletes files so that thieves can’t access them. (Quick fact: deleting files in your trash doesn’t actually delete them in the truest sense. They’re still there until they’re “shredded” or otherwise overwritten such that they can’t be restored.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5) Steer clear of those internet “quizzes”</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Which Marvel Universe superhero are you? Does it really matter? After all, such quizzes and social media posts are often grifting pieces of your PII in a seemingly playful way. While you’re not giving up your SSN, you may be giving up things like your birthday, your pet’s name, your first car … things that people often use to compose their passwords or use as answers to common security questions on banking and financial sites. The one way to pass this kind of quiz is not to take it!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">6) Be on the lookout for phishing attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">A far more direct form of separating you from your PII are phishing attacks. Posing as emails from known or trusted brands, financial institutions, or even a friend or family member a cybercrook’s phishing attack will attempt to trick you into sharing important information like your logins, account numbers, credit card numbers, and so on under the guise of providing customer service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">How do you spot such emails? Well, it’s getting a little tougher nowadays because scammers are getting more sophisticated and can make their phishing emails look nearly legitimate. However, </span><span data-contrast="auto">there are several ways you can </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-spot-fake-login-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">spot a phishing email and phony web </span></a><span data-contrast="none">pages</span><span data-contrast="auto"> as outlined here</span><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security offers another layer of prevention, in this case by offering browser protection like our own Web Advisor, which will alert you in the event you come across suspicious links and downloads that can steal your PII or otherwise expose you to attacks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">7) Keep mum in your social media profile</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With social engineering attacks that deceive victims by posing as people the victim knows and the way we can sometimes overshare a little too much about our lives, you can see why a social media profile is a potential goldmine for cybercriminals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Two things you can do to help protect your PII from being at risk via social media: one, think twice about what PII you might be sharing in that post or photo—like the location of your child’s school or the license plate on your car; two, set your profile to private so that only friends can see it. Review your privacy settings regularly to keep your profile information out of the public eye. And remember, nothing is 100% private on the internet. Never post anything you wouldn’t want to see shared.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">8) Look for HTTPS when you browse</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The “S” stands for secure. Any time you are shopping, banking, or sharing any kind of PII, look for “https” at the start of the web address. Some browsers will also indicate HTTP by showing a small “lock” icon. Doing otherwise on plain HTTP sites exposes your PII for anyone who cares to monitor that site for unsecured connections.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">9) Lock your devices</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">By locking your devices, you protect yourself that much better from PII and data theft in the event your device is lost, stolen, or even left unattended for a short stretch. Use your password, PIN, facial recognition, thumbprint ID, what have you. Just lock your stuff. In the case of your smartphones, </span><span data-contrast="auto">read up on how you can locate your phone or even wipe it remotely if you need to. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide for remotely wiping devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">10) Keep tabs on your credit—and your PII</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Theft of your PII can of course lead to credit cards and other accounts being opened falsely in your name. What’s more, it can sometimes be some time before you even become aware of it, until perhaps your credit score takes a hit or a bill collector comes calling. By checking your credit, you can address any issues that come up, as companies typically have a clear-cut process for contesting any fraud. You can get a free credit report in the U.S. via the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and likewise, other nations like the UK have similar free offerings as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Consider identity theft protection as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">A strong identity theft protection package pairs well with keeping track of your credit and offers cyber monitoring that scans the dark web to detect for misuse of your PII</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. With our identity protection service, we help </span><span data-contrast="auto">relieve the burden of identity theft if the unfortunate happens to you with $1M coverage for lawyer fees, travel expenses, lost wages, and more. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

It first hit the digital scene in 1995, at a time when millions flocked to <a href="https://www.phishing.org/history-of-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">America Online (AOL)</a> every day. And if we know one thing about cybercriminals, it’s that they tend to follow the masses. In earlier iterations, phishing attempts were easy to spot due to link misspellings, odd link redirects, and other giveaways. However, today’s phishing tricks have become personalized, advanced, and shrouded in new disguises. So, let’s take a look at some of the different types, real-world examples and how you can recognize a phishing lure.</p>
<h3><strong>Be Wary of Suspicious Emails</strong></h3>
<p>Every day, users get sent thousands of emails. Some are important, but most are just plain junk. These emails often get filtered to a spam folder, where <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phishing emails</a> are often trapped. But sometimes they slip through the digital cracks, into a main inbox. These messages typically have urgent requests that require the user to input sensitive information or fill out a form through an external link. These phishing emails can take on <a href="https://now.uiowa.edu/2019/09/avoid-these-10-common-phishing-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many personas</a>, such as banking institutions, popular services, and universities. As such, always remember to stay vigilant and double-check the source before giving away any information.</p>
<h3><strong>Link Look-A-Likes</strong></h3>
<p>A sort of sibling to email phishing, <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/enterprise/phishing/phishing-tools-techniques/link-manipulation/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link manipulation</a> is when a cybercriminal sends users a link to malicious website under the ruse of an urgent request or deadline. After clicking on the deceptive link, the user is brought to the cybercriminal’s fake website rather than a real or verified link and asked to input or verify personal details. This exact scenario happened last year when several universities and businesses fell for a campaign disguised as a package delivery issue from <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/09/20/manipulation-tactics-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FedEx</a>. This scheme is a reminder that anyone can fall for a cybercriminals trap, which is why users always have to careful when clicking, as well as ensure the validity of the claim and source of the link. To check the validity, it’s always a good idea to contact the source directly to see if the notice or request is legitimate.</p>
<h3><strong>Gone Whaling</strong></h3>
<p>Corporate executives have always been high-level targets for cybercriminals. That’s why C-suite members have a special name for when cybercriminals try to phish them – <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2019/02/phishing-vs-spear-phishing-vs-whaling-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whaling</a>. What sounds like a silly name is anything but. In this sophisticated, as well as personalized attack, a cybercriminal attempts to manipulate the target to obtain money, trade secrets, or employee information. In recent years, organizations have become smarter and in turn, whaling has slowed down. Before the slowdown, however, many companies were hit with data breaches due to cybercriminals impersonating C-suite members and asking lower-level employees for company information. To avoid this pesky phishing attempt, train C-suite members to be able to identify phishing, as well as encourage unique, strong passwords on all devices and accounts.</p>
<h3><strong>Spear Target Acquired </strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>Just as email spam and link manipulation are phishing siblings, so too are whaling and <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/spear-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spear-phishing</a>. While whaling attacks target the C-suite of a specific organization, spear-phishing rather targets lower-level employees of a specific organization. Just as selective and sophisticated as whaling, spear-phishing targets members of a specific organization to gain access to critical information, like staff credentials, intellectual property, customer data, and more. Spear-phishing attacks tend to be more <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lucrative</a> than a run-of-the-mill phishing attack, which is why cybercriminals will often spend more time crafting and obtaining personal information from these specific targets. To avoid falling for this phishing scheme, employees must have proper security training so they know how to spot a phishing lure when they see one.</p>
<h3><strong>Spoofed Content </strong></h3>
<p>With so many things to click on a website, it’s easy to see why cybercriminals would take advantage of that fact. <a href="https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/content-spoofing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content spoofing</a> is based on exactly that notion – a cybercriminal alters a section of content on a page of a reliable website to redirect an unsuspecting user to an illegitimate website where they are then asked to enter personal details. The best way to steer clear of this phishing scheme is to check that the URL matches the primary domain name.</p>
<h3><strong>Phishing in a Search Engine Pond</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>When users search for something online, they expect reliable resources. But sometimes, phishing sites can sneak their way into legitimate results. This tactic is called <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/enterprise/phishing/phishing-definition-and-history/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search engine phishing</a> and involves search engines being manipulated into showing malicious results. Users are attracted to these sites by discount offers for products or services. However, when the user goes to buy said product or service, their personal details are collected by the deceptive site. To stay secure, watch out for potentially sketchy ads in particular and when in doubt always navigate to the official site first.</p>
<h3><strong>Who’s That Caller?</strong></h3>
<p>With new technologies come new avenues for cybercriminals to try and obtain personal data. Vishing, or <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/mobile-and-iot-security/voice-phishing-tricks-unsuspecting-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voice phishing</a>, is one of those new avenues. In a vishing attempt, cybercriminals contact users by phone and ask the user to dial a number to receive identifiable bank account or personal information through the phone by using a fake caller ID. For example, just <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/voice-phishing-scams-are-getting-more-clever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, a security researcher received a call from their financial institution saying that their card had been compromised. Instead of offering a replacement card, the bank suggested simply blocking any future geographic-specific transactions. Sensing something was up, the researcher hung up and dialed his bank – they had no record of the call or the fraudulent card transactions. This scenario, as sophisticated as it sounds, reminds users to always double-check directly with businesses before sharing any personal information.</p>
<p>As you can see, phishing comes in all shapes and sizes. This blog only scratches the surface of all the ways cybercriminals lure unsuspecting users into phishing traps. The best way to stay protected is to invest in comprehensive security and stay <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated on new phishing scams</a>.</p>

You hope it’s a reply from last night’s date, but instead you get an entirely different swooping feeling: It’s an alarming SMS text alerting you about suspicious activity on your bank account and that immediate action is necessary. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Take a deep breath and make sure to read the message carefully. Luckily, your assets could be completely safe. It could just be a smisher.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Smishing, or phishing over SMS, is a tactic where cybercriminals impersonate reputable organizations or people and trick people into handing over their PII or financial details. Sometimes they can seem very credible with the information they have, and you may have even been expecting a correspondence of a similar nature.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So how can you tell when an SMS text is real and requires your attention? And how should you deal with a smisher to </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">keep your identity safe</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/phishing-email-examples-how-to-recognize-a-phishing-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">email phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/its-social-media-day-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-from-social-engineering-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">social media phishing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">,</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">SMS text phishing often tries to use a strong emotion – like fear, anger, guilt, or excitement – to get you to respond immediately and without thinking through the request completely. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of one coordinated smishing attack, cybercriminals not only impersonated financial institutions but collected PII on their targets ahead of time. The criminals then used these personal details – like old addresses and Social Security Numbers – to convince people that they were legitimate bank employees.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> But since when does a bank try to prove itself to the customer? Usually, it’s the other way around, where they’ll ask you to confirm your identity. Be wary of anyone who texts or calls you and has your PII. If you&#8217;re ever suspicious of a caller or texter claiming they’re a financial official, contact your bank through verified channels (chat, email, or phone) you find on the bank&#8217;s website to make sure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Smishers often keep up with current events and attempt to impersonate well-known companies that have a reason to reach out to their customers. This adds false legitimacy to their message. For example, in the summer of 2022, Rogers Communications, a Canadian telecommunications provider, experienced an extended loss of service and told customers they could expect a reimbursement. Smishers jumped on the opportunity and sent a barrage of fake texts requesting banking details in order to carry out the reimbursement.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> However, Rogers credited customers directly to their Rogers accounts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Now in its 21</span><span data-contrast="none">st</span><span data-contrast="none"> year, Cybersecurity Awareness Month marks a long-standing collaboration between the U.S. government and private industry. It’s aim, empower people to protect themselves from digital forms of crime. And that stands as a good reminder. Phishing attacks, malware, and the other threats we regularly talk about in our blog are indeed forms of crime. And where there’s crime, there’s a person behind it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It can be easy to lose sight of that, particularly as the crook on the other end of the attack is hiding behind a computer. Cybercrime can feel anonymous that way, yet it’s anything but. Whether a single bad actor </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/organized-cybercrime-the-big-business-behind-hacks-and-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">or as part of a large crime organization</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, people power cybercrime.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet just as you secure your home to prevent yourself from becoming a victim of a criminal, you can also secure your digital life to prevent yourself from becoming a victim of cybercriminal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Shore up your security, easily.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You have plenty of places where you can start, and they’re all good ones. Even a handful of the simplest measures can significantly decrease your risk. Better yet, several take far less time to put into place than you might think, while yet more work automatically once you implement them—making them a sort of “set it and forget it” security measure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With that, this five-step list can get you going:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1) Use strong passwords and a password manager to stay on top of them all</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Strong, unique passwords offer another primary line of defense. Yet with all the accounts we have floating around, juggling dozens of strong and unique passwords can feel like a task—thus the temptation to use (and re-use) simpler passwords. Hackers love this because one password can be the key to several accounts. Instead, try a password manager that can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and McAfee also offers </span><a href="https://www.truekey.com/#features" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a free service with True Key</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2) Set your apps and operating system to update automatically</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Updates do all kinds of great things for gaming, streaming, and chatting apps, like add more features and functionality over time. Updates do something else—they make those apps more secure. Hackers will hammer away at apps to find or create vulnerabilities, which can steal personal info or compromise the device itself. Updates will often include security improvements, in addition to performance improvements. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Often overlooked is the humble browser. Yet if you think about it, the browser is one of the apps we use most often. Particularly on our desktops. It takes us shopping, to shows, the bank, and even work. Hackers realize that, which is why they love targeting browsers. Whether it’s through vulnerabilities in the code that runs the browser, injecting malicious code into a browser session, or </span><a href="https://www.itbusinessedge.com/security/top-five-vulnerabilities-attackers-use-against-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">any one of several other attack vectors</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, hackers will try to find a way to compromise computers via the browser.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Chances are you’re using multi-factor authentication (MFA) on a few of your accounts already, like with your bank or financial institutions.

It’s quite common nowadays, where an online account will ask you to use an email or a text to your smartphone to as part of your logon process. If you have MFA as an option when logging into your accounts, strongly consider using it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

This adds an extra layer of security, because a thief would have to have access to your device, your email, or be able to trick a biometric reader to get into your online account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most online sites offer the option to turn on MFA. While it may add an extra few seconds to the login process, it’s well worth it. Username and password combinations can be up for sale on the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">dark web</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> following a breach. With these in hand, a cybercriminal could then help themselves to your online bank account, online medical records, and possibly your identity. When an account is secured with MFA, a criminal may quickly move on to another target that’s easier to crack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Using Strong Passwords and Password Managers</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most sites won’t even let you proceed with creating an account if you don’t have a strong enough password. A </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/tips-for-creating-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">strong password</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is one with a mix of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. What also makes for an excellent password is one that’s unique. Reusing passwords can be just as risky as using “password123” or your pet’s name plus your birthday as a password. A reused password can put all your online accounts at risk, due to a practice called </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/its-social-media-day-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-from-social-engineering-online/"><span data-contrast="none">credential stuffing</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Credential stuffing is a tactic where a cybercriminal attempts to input a stolen username and password combination in dozens of random websites and to see which doors it opens.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Remembering a different password for each of your online accounts is almost an impossible task. Luckily, password managers make it so you only have to remember one password ever again! Password managers, like the one available in <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee+</a>.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> safeguard all your passwords in one secure desktop extension or cellphone app that you can use anywhere. McAfee+ is secured with one of the most secure encryption algorithms available, and multifactor authentication is always standard.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s best to create passwords or passphrases that have a secret meaning that only you know. Stay away from using significant dates, names, or places, because those are easier to guess. You can also leave it up to your password manager to randomly generate a password for you. The resulting unintelligible jumble of numbers, letters, and symbols is virtually impossible for anyone to guess.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Updating Software</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Software update notifications always seem ping on the outskirts of your desktop and mobile device at the most inconvenient times. What’s more inconvenient though is having your device hacked. Another easy tip to improve your cybersecurity is to update your device software whenever upgrades are available. Most software updates include security patches that smart teams have created to foil cybercriminals. The more outdated your apps or operating system is, the more time criminals have had to work out ways to infiltrate them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Consider enabling automatic updates on all your devices. Many major updates occur in the early hours of the morning, meaning that you’ll never know your devices were offline. You’ll just wake up to new, secure software!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Recognizing and Reporting Phishing</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You’ve likely already experienced a phishing attempt, whether you were aware of it or not. Phishing is a common tactic used to eke personal details from unsuspecting or trusting people. Phishers often initiate contact through texts, emails, or social media direct messages, and they aim to get enough information to hack into your online accounts or to impersonate you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}"> </span></p>

This method of hacking requires the seemingly not-so-easy task of impersonating someone else, yet clearly, it happened to the CEO of a major tech company. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Protecting your personal info and identity online can help prevent hackers from impersonating you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to pull off this and other crimes. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">WireGuard is the latest standard in Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology, and we’re rolling it out across </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Secure VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> for Windows</span><span data-contrast="none"> which is included in </span><span data-contrast="none">our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">comprehensive online protection plans.</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> And just as before, it offers smart protection that can be set to automatically turn on when you need it, so you can stay more private and more secure online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re new to using a VPN, let’s take a quick look at two of the big things a VPN can do for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">It makes you more secure.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The bank-grade encryption used by a strong VPN shields your data and information while it’s in transit, which makes it difficult for hackers to spy on your connection. (Think of your data and information traveling through a tunnel that no one else can use or see into.) In that way, a VPN makes all kinds of online activities more secure—like banking, shopping, and checking up on your finances, even using your apps. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">It protects your privacy.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By masking your whereabouts and your IP address, along with encryption that helps keep your activities private, a VPN reduces the personal information that others can collect and track. That includes internet service providers, social media companies, businesses, app developers, websites, and others who gather your data for marketing purposes or for resale to third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">A faster and more stable VPN with WireGuard</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A quick word about what WireGuard is in slightly more detail. It’s a VPN protocol, which is a series of technical rules that govern how your device can securely reach the VPN servers, validate your access to the requests you make online, and encrypt your browsing traffic so that only you can see what you are doing over the internet. WireGuard is one of several protocols that we support, such as the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols. While WireGuard improves upon OpenVPN and IKEv2 in many ways, both are still secure and safe ways in which a VPN can connect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now with the latest WireGuard standard in place, our VPN for Windows that comes with all our all-in-one plans offers faster speeds and improved stability compared to what previous standards offered. This gives you the security of a VPN with similar performance as if you were on a fully open connection—along with the added benefit of keeping your browsing and other activities private.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, the improved speed and stability give privacy-conscious people a further reason to use a VPN more often than before. Because a VPN can minimize the exposure of data as it transmits to and from your devices, companies and data brokers can potentially learn far less about you, your shopping, your travels, your habits, and any other information that they could possibly collect and otherwise profit from. The more often you use a VPN, the less they can potentially gather.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="200" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/300x200_blogrr_.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/300x200_blogrr_.jpg 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/300x200_blogrr_-194x129.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Optus, one of Australia’s largest telecommunications carriers, <a href="https://www.optus.com.au/about/media-centre/media-releases/2022/09/optus-notifies-customers-of-cyberattack">reported news of a data breach</a> that may have compromised the information of current and former customers.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the company has not stated how many customers may have been affected, citing their ongoing investigation in conjunction with law enforcement and Australian government officials</p>
<p>According to Optus, the breach may have included the following:</p>
<p>“Information which may have been exposed includes customers’ names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and, for a subset of customers, addresses, ID document numbers such as driver&#8217;s license or passport numbers. Payment detail and account passwords have not been compromised.”</p>
<p>Optus is currently notifying customers who may have been affected by this breach with SMS and email messages. However, the company makes an important distinction here:</p>
<p>“We are not sending links in SMS or emails. If customers receive an email or SMS with a link claiming to be from Optus, they are advised that this is not a communication from Optus. Please do not click on any links.”</p>
<p>Often in the wake of such breaches, cybercriminals will send out phony communications that use the name of the company affected. These can include phishing attacks over email and SMS that solicit personal and account information or other tactics that attempt to capitalize on the announced breach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optus.com.au/about/media-centre/media-releases/2022/09/optus-notifies-customers-of-cyberattack">Optus continues to keep its customers up to date on the latest developments on its website</a>, which includes a comprehensive FAQ that details what happened, what steps are being taken, and what customers can do in the wake of this announcement.</p>
<h2>What should I do if I think my information was caught up in the Optus breach?</h2>
<p>Any time a data breach occurs, your exposed personal information may be used by those trying to commit identity fraud or theft. Different pieces of personal information can be more useful to them than others.</p>
<p>Some information is directly useful, such as a driver’s license or credit card information because they identify you right away. Others are indirectly helpful, like device IDs, browsing history, geolocation information, and internet protocol addresses. While they don’t identify you on their own, a cybercriminal could piece together your identity if they have enough indirect information about you.</p>
<p>In light of this, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself in the aftermath of a data breach, which involve a combination of preventative steps and some monitoring on your part.</p>
<h3>Work with a credit and identity recovery pro</h3>
<p>If you become the victim of fraud or theft after a data breach, a licensed recovery pro can help you restore your credit and identity. If you’ve ever dealt with fraud or theft before, or know someone who has, recovery can be a time-consuming and stressful process if you undertake it alone.  With McAfee+ Advanced, you have around-the-clock support from a restoration expert with limited power of attorney who can take the steps that can help restore your credit and identity.</p>
<p>Working with an expert can lend you extra peace of mind, particularly in a time where there’s plenty of uncertainty. First, you’ll know that a professional is working on your case—a person who knows exactly where to start and what needs to happen for the best possible outcome. Second, you’ll get precious time back, time you’d otherwise have to spend if you took on the process yourself.</p>
<h3>Keep an eye out for phishing attacks</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, with some personal information in hand, cybercriminals may seek out more. They may follow up a breach with rounds of <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-phishing/#:~:text=How%20does%20phishing%20work%3F">phishing attacks</a> that direct you to bogus sites designed to steal your personal information—either by tricking you into providing it or by stealing it without your knowledge. So, it’s always wise to keep a skeptical eye open for unsolicited messages or phone calls that ask you for information in some form or other, often in ways that urge or pressure you into acting.</p>
<h3>Consider using identity monitoring</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-au/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs">An identity monitoring service</a> can monitor your information from email addresses to IDs and phone numbers for signs of breaches so you can take action to secure your accounts before they’re used for identity theft.​ Personal information harvested from data breaches can end up on dark web marketplaces where it’s bought by other cyber criminals so they can launch their own attacks. McAfee monitors the dark web for your personal info and provides early alerts if your data is found, an average of 10 months ahead of similar services.​ We also provide guidance to help you act if your information is found.</p>
<h3>Change your passwords and use a password manager</h3>
<p>While it does not appear that login information was affected, a password update is still a strong security move. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/strong-password-ideas-to-keep-your-information-safe">Strong and unique passwords are best</a>, which means never reusing your passwords across different sites and platforms. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/password-manager?path=blogs">Using a password manager</a> will help you keep on top of it all, while also storing your passwords securely. Moreover, changing your passwords regularly may make a stolen password worthless because it’s out of date.</p>
<h3>Enable two-factor authentication</h3>
<p>While a strong and unique password is a good first line of defense, enabling two-factor authentication across your accounts will help your cause by providing an added layer of security. It’s increasingly common to see nowadays where banks and all manner of online services will only allow access to your accounts after you’ve provided a one-time passcode sent to your email or smartphone. If your accounts support two-factor authentication, enable it.</p>
<h3>Clean up your personal data online</h3>
<p>Mentioned earlier, information stolen in a data breach may indirectly identify you. Yet when pieced together with other information, it can then directly identify you. One way cybercriminals complete this identity picture puzzle is with information provided by data brokers that buy and sell personal information online. However, you can take some control over this. <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html#:~:text=Personal%20Data%20Clean%20Up?path=blogs">Our Personal Data Cleanup service scans high-risk data broker sites for your personal information</a> and then helps you remove it—which denies cybercriminals the information they may need to commit identity theft.</p>
<h3>Check your credit and consider a credit freeze</h3>
<p>When personal information gets released, there’s a chance that a hacker, scammer, or thief will put it to use. This may include committing fraud, where they draw funds from existing accounts, and theft, where they create new accounts in a victim’s name.</p>
<p>Even though it’s believed that no payment information was involved in this breach, customers should still take steps to monitor their statements and their overall credit report so that they can spot and address any unusual activity. Optus has announced that it will offer affected customers 12 months of credit and identity monitoring through Equifax, one of the major global credit agencies, at no cost.</p>
<p>Another step that customers can take is to place a credit freeze on their credit reports with the major credit agencies in Australia— Equifax, illion, and Experian. This will help prevent cybercriminals from opening new lines of credit or taking out loans in a victim&#8217;s name by “freezing” their credit report so that potential creditors cannot pull it for reference. Terms of freezing a credit report will vary, so check with each agency for details.</p>
<h3>Consider using comprehensive online protection</h3>
<p>A complete suite of online protection software can offer layers of extra security for future protection. In addition to more private and secure time online with a VPN, identity monitoring, and password management, protection like McAfee+ Advanced includes web browser protection that can block malicious and suspicious links that could lead you down the road to malware or a phishing scam—which antivirus protection can’t do alone.</p>
<h2>Should I replace my driver’s license and passport for a new ID number?</h2>
<p>Per Optus, a subset of those affected may have had their driver’s license and/or passport ID number affected by the breach. Given that license and passport ID numbers are such unique pieces of personally identifiable information, anyone notified by Optus that theirs may have been affected should strongly consider changing them.</p>
<p>The process for replacing either document will vary depending on your state or territory. Given the scope of the attack, some states and territories have proposed making exceptions to the rules for attack victims. As of this writing, that picture continues to evolve, so look to your local government for guidance.</p>
<h2>The Optus data breach – you have ways to protect yourself</h2>
<p>Not all data breaches make the news. Businesses and organizations, large and small, have all fallen victim to them, and with regularity. The measures you can take here are measures you can take even if you don’t believe you were caught up in the Optus breach. As you can see, several of them are preventative, which is important because word of data breaches tend to reach customers days, weeks, or even months after they’ve been discovered—leaving cybercriminals plenty of opportunity to commit all kinds of identity crime in the meantime.</p>
<p>In this case, the breach certainly made the news due to its apparent size and scale. And as Optus works with law enforcement and government officials, more details into the attack and who has been affected will arise.</p>
<p>However, you have every reason to act now rather than wait for additional news. Staying on top of our credit and identity has always been important, but given all the devices, apps, and accounts we keep these days leaves us more exposed than ever, making protecting ourselves a must.</p>

You never know the twists and turns life might take you, so even if these financial milestones aren’t on your radar now, it’s nice to know that a great credit score will open many doors for you when you’re ready. The better your credit score, the more likely you are to get the loan you want at the best interest rate.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many people feel lost on how to prevent these problems or what to do if they suspect identity theft. Luckily, new McAfee services called credit lock and security freeze, which includes credit freeze, are great tools to add to your credit protection toolbelt. They’ll help protect your most personal information from thieves, and both services will help give you the peace of mind you need to confidently go about your day.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Credit fraud is a type of identity theft where a criminal uses your information to borrow money, open a new credit or debit card, or uses your card to make purchases that they never intend to pay off. Then, when the loan defaults and the bills stack up, the victim is often left with their credit score in shambles.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to the FTC, credit fraud is the most common type of identity theft in 2020 and 2021, receiving nearly 18,000 reports from people saying that someone used their information to gain illegal access to their credit card accounts.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

The credit freeze prevents most credit-related fraud by preventing companies from accessing your credit reports, a step that’s necessary to open a loan, credit card, and more in your name. A credit freeze requires more information than a credit lock to set up and usually takes 24 hours to apply or remove.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;335559991&quot;:430}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A credit lock and a credit freeze both stop companies from accessing your credit information without your consent when an application for a loan or credit card is submitted.

By toggling a switch in the <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAfee Protection Center</a>, turning on a credit lock is almost instantaneous. A credit freeze can take up to a day to enable or remove; however, it may offer stronger financial loss protection in most U.S. states if an unauthorized line of credit goes through while all three credit bureaus are frozen. Also, McAfee’s credit lock stops one credit bureau from accessing your account, while a credit freeze enables you to halt all three.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee credit lock lets you simply toggle on and off one credit bureau’s ability to access your credit report.

Credit lock and credit freeze may help you feel calmer in a situation of suspected or real identity theft and gives you peace of mind to help prevent credit fraud from happening in the first place. Speed is of the utmost importance when foiling a criminal, so both solutions are easy to use with intuitive design so you&#8217;re not wasting time trying to figure out how they work. Plus, neither will affect your credit score. They just stop creditors from looking at your credit files, while you continue to boost your credit with your smart habits.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Ever.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Your phone gets to be like an old friend after a while. You have things laid out the way you like, your favorite apps are at the ready, and you have the perfect home screen and wallpaper all loaded up. So, if you unlock your phone one day and notice that something is a little … off, you’ll know pretty quickly. And it could be a sign that your phone may be hacked. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How to know if your phone is hacked?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s often pretty easy to tell when a piece of your tech isn’t working quite right. The performance is off, things crash, and so on. While there are several cases where there’s a legitimate technical issue behind that, it could also be the sign of a hacked device. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many hacks and attacks involve the installation of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">malware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on the device, which eats up system resources, creates conflicts with other apps, and uses your data or internet connection to pass along your personal information—all of which can make your smartphone feel a little off.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few examples follow. Note that these </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">may </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">be signs of a hacked phone, yet not always.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Performance hits and battery drain</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A suddenly sluggish phone or one that simply can’t hold a charge anymore are often attributed to phones that are getting a little old (these things happen). Yet, those same behaviors can also be signs of a compromised phone. For example, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/consumer-threat-reports/bitcoin-mining-security-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">malicious bitcoin miners</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can run in the background and cause all types of performance issues because they eat up battery life and take up resources that your phone could otherwise normally use. In a way, it’s like having a second person using your phone at the same time you are.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your phone feels like it’s running hot</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Similar to the performance issues mentioned above, malware or mining apps running in the background can burn extra computing power, battery life, and data. Aside from a performance hit, they can cause your phone to physically run hot or even overheat. So if your phone feels like it’s been sitting in the sun, this could be a sign that malware is present.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Popups suddenly appear on your phone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re seeing more popup ads than usual or seeing them for the first time, it could be a sign that your phone has been hit with adware—a type of malicious app that hackers use to generate revenue by distributing ads without the consent of the user. Furthermore, those ads may be malicious in nature as well (which is a good reminder to never click on them). Such ads may lead to bogus products and services or pages designed to steal personal information. All in all, malicious adware is what hackers prop up to make money off unsuspecting people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Mysterious apps, calls, or texts appear</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A potential telltale sign that your phone has been hacked is the appearance of new apps that you didn’t download, along with spikes in data usage that you can’t account for. Likewise, if you see calls in your phone bill that you didn’t make, that’s a warning as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">You run out of data or see unknown charges pop up</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Big red flag here. Like seeing an unknown charge or payment in your bank statement, this is a possible sign that a hacker has hijacked your phone and is using it to transfer data, make purchases, send messages, or make calls via your phone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">To help keep your phone from getting hacked in the first place, there are a few relatively easy steps you can take. Inside of a few minutes, you can find yourself much safer than you were before. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Use comprehensive security software on your phone.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Over the years, we’ve gotten into the good habit of using this on our computers and laptops. Our phones? Not so much. </span><a href="https://mmsmcafee.onelink.me/mcafeefree/helpIthinkmyphonehasbeenhacked?path=blogs"><span data-contrast="none">Installing security software on your smartphone</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> gives you the first line of defense against attacks, plus several of the additional security features mentioned below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Stay safer on the go with a VPN.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> One way that crooks can hack their way into your phone is via public Wi-Fi, such as at airports, hotels, and even libraries. These networks are public, meaning that your activities are exposed to others on the network—your banking, your password usage, all of it. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">One way to make a public network private is with a VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which can keep you and all you do protected from others on that Wi-Fi hotspot. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Use a password manager.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Strong, unique passwords offer another primary line of defense. Yet with all the accounts we have floating around, juggling dozens of strong and unique passwords can feel like a task—thus the temptation to use (and re-use) simpler passwords. Hackers love this because one password can be the key to several accounts. Instead, try a password manager that can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Avoid public charging stations.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Charging up at a public station seems so simple and safe. However, some hackers have been known to “juice jack” by installing malware into the charging station. </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/11/27/protect-your-data-while-charging-phone-at-airport/4319388002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">While you “juice up,” they “jack” your passwords and personal info. </span></a><span data-contrast="auto">So what to do about power on the road? You can look into a portable power pack that you can charge up ahead of time or run on AA batteries. They’re pretty inexpensive and can prevent malware from a public charging station. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Keep your eyes on your phone.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Preventing the actual theft of your phone is important too, as some hacks happen simply because a phone falls into the wrong hands. This is a good case for password or PIN protecting your phone, as well as turning on device tracking so that you can locate your phone or even wipe it remotely if you need to. </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Apple provides iOS users with a step-by-step guide for remotely wiping devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491/find-lock-or-erase-a-lost-android-device?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Google offers up a guide for Android users as well</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Phone acting funny? Follow up.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A phone that’s acting a little funny may indicate a run-of-the-mill tech issue, yet it could also be a tell-tale sign of a hack. At a minimum, following up on your gut instinct that something isn’t quite right can take care of a nagging tech issue. But in the event of a possible hack, it can save you the far greater headache of unauthorized charges and purchases, and even identity theft. If you spot a problem, it absolutely pays to take a closer look. Follow up with tech support for help, whether that’s through your device manufacturer, retailer, or your antivirus providers. They’ll help pinpoint the issue and get you on your way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">However, it’s important to realize that ransomware is unlike any other attack. When ransomware locks someone out of their device or encrypts their data and files so they can’t use them, a demand is usually made for money. Sometimes, paying the ransom results in the device being made accessible again or the files being decrypted. Yet like any ransom case, this result is not always guaranteed. There are plenty of cases where people pay the ransom but never get their data or access to their devices back.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is ransomware?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As the name implies, ransomware is a type of malware that holds your device or information for ransom. It may lock your computer or smartphone entirely or it may you out of your files by encrypting them so that you can’t access them. Whether it’s a hacker or a cybercrime organization behind the attack, the bad actor involved holds the key to unlock those files—and promises to do so. For a price. And as mentioned above, sometimes that doesn’t happen, even if you pay.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ransomware can infect your devices several different ways:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Ransomware has seen quite the evolution over the years. Its origins date back to the late 1980s, where malware-loaded floppy disks were sent to users who installed them under false pretenses. There the malware would lie in wait until the user rebooted their computer for the 90</span><span data-contrast="none">th</span><span data-contrast="none"> time and presented with a digital ransom note.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">From there, ransomware attacks on individuals became more sophisticated, and more lucrative, with the advent of the internet and the millions of everyday users who flocked to it. Using phishing emails, malware downloads from phony sites, and compromised software and networks, hackers rapidly expanded their ransomware reach. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, yet more lucrative for hackers and organized cybercriminals were public and private organizations. Shifting their attacks to so-called “big game” targets, hackers and organized cybercriminals have used ransomware to extort money from </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/05/18/ransomware-attacks-on-hospitals-put-patients-at-risk"><span data-contrast="none">hospitals</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/atlanta-us-attorney-charges-iranian-nationals-city-atlanta-ransomware-attack#:~:text=According%20to%20U,to%20restore%20access."><span data-contrast="none">city governments</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial%20Trend%20Analysis_Ransomware%20508%20FINAL.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">financial institutions</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/colonial-pipeline-cyber-incident"><span data-contrast="none">key energy infrastructure companies</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, to name just a few. Seeing further opportunity, ransomware attackers then began targeting smaller and mid-sized businesses as well. While the ransom demands account for lower amounts, these organizations often lack dedicated cybersecurity teams and the protections that come along with them, making these organizations easier to victimize.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Meanwhile, the body of malicious code and attack packages used to launch ransomware attacks has only grown. As a result, small-time hackers and hacking groups can find the tools they need to conduct an attack for sale or for lease as a service (Ransomware as a Service, or RaaS). In effect, these bad actors can simply access a dark web marketplace and figuratively pull a ready-to-deploy attack off the shelf.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result, ransomware remains a concern for individuals, even as businesses and governmental bodies of all sizes deal with its threat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting yourself from ransomware attacks</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What makes ransomware so damaging is just how much effort it can take to undo. Setting aside the sophisticated attacks on businesses and governments for a moment, even those “off-the-shelf” attacks that some hackers will launch against individuals go beyond the average user’s ability to undo. For example, there are some known attacks with known methods of decrypting the data, however, that requires knowing specifically which attack was used. Attempting to undo the encryption with the wrong solution can potentially encrypt that data even more.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So without question, the best defense against ransomware is prevention. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive online protection software gives you the tools you need to help avoid becoming a ransomware victim</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are some situations where you’ll want to change your password immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Your account was hacked</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you think someone has hacked your account, it’s important to act fast and change your password. Did everyone in your address book get a strange email that looks like it’s from you? Change your email password. Are your Facebook friends getting a new friend request from you? Something’s not right, so you’ll want to change your password. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This can help limit the amount of time a </span><span data-contrast="auto">cybercriminal</span><span data-contrast="auto"> has access to your account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If there’s a </span><span data-contrast="auto">password breach</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at work or within a company you do business with, you’ll want to change the password for any affected accounts. If you use that password for any other websites, you’ll definitely want to change your password to those accounts. If hackers get access to your password, they may try it on multiple websites to see what else they can steal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">You used an unsecure network</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As much as possible, try to avoid logging into your secure accounts on public Wi-Fi, such as at a library or cafe.

If you need to use an unsecure network, change your password once you’re on a secure network. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It can also be a good idea to look into a smart VPN like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Secure VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which automatically turns on to protect your personal data and credit card information even if you need to use public Wi-Fi. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

Here are a few additional tips for keeping your passwords safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Do a password audit</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Review the passwords for all of your accounts. Make sure you’re not using any for multiple websites. See if your passwords are guessable. Do they include personal information like birthdays or addresses? If you find passwords that are weak or repeated, change those first.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Use </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">multi-factor authentication</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Set up </span><span data-contrast="auto">multi-factor authentication</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for important accounts, such as with financial institutions. Logging into a website with </span><span data-contrast="auto">two-factor authentication</span><span data-contrast="auto"> requires you to enter a code sent by text or email in addition to a username and password. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some accounts require </span><span data-contrast="auto">multi-factor authentication</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with biometric factors for added security, such as a thumbprint or face scan. Using </span><span data-contrast="auto">multi-factor authentication</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with long, complicated passwords can make an account more secure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Use a </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">password manager</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><span data-contrast="auto">password manager</span><span data-contrast="auto"> like McAfee True Key can help prevent </span><span data-contrast="auto">unauthorized access</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to your </span><span data-contrast="auto">online accounts</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by protecting your passwords with strong encryption. It also comes with a </span><span data-contrast="auto">password generator</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to help you create </span><span data-contrast="auto">complex passwords</span><span data-contrast="auto"> while storing them safely. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you have old or </span><span data-contrast="auto">weak passwords</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or use them on multiple sites, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">password manager</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can generate new ones. It’ll then keep track of them and sign you in to </span><span data-contrast="auto">apps</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and websites — with you only having to remember one </span><span data-contrast="auto">master password</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee True Key stores your passwords on your device using the strongest encryption available. Once you use a </span><span data-contrast="auto">master password</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to log into True Key, it’ll auto-fill your passwords for any </span><span data-contrast="auto">apps</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or websites you visit.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier, I mentioned contacting your bank directly to ensure you’re speaking to a proper representative. Another way you can go directly to the source is to use your bank’s website or app to check up on your accounts. Once again, don’t click any links in a text or email. Just go to your bank’s website or app to check your account. You can make sure you have your bank’s official app by visiting the Google Play or Apple’s App Store and looking at the information section to ensure that it was indeed developed by your bank—not a copycat.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Strong and unique passwords for each of your online accounts can help keep hackers at bay. With data breaches occurring so often, updating them regularly is important too. Yet with all the accounts we keep, that can mean a lot of work. However, a password manager can create those passwords for you and safely store them as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Comprehensive security software will include one.</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Use two-factor authentication on your accounts </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of defense on top of your username and password. It adds in the use of a special one-time-use code to access your account, usually sent to you via email or to your phone by text or a phone call. In all, it combines something you know, like your password, with something you have, like your smartphone. Together, that makes it tougher for a crook to hack your account. If any of your accounts support two-factor authentication, the few extra seconds it takes to set up is more than worth the big boost in protection you’ll get. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When you log onto public Wi-Fi, potentially anyone can see your internet activity—and that includes things like entering your username and password. For that reason, only log into your bank account with public Wi-Fi if you’re using a virtual private network (VPN).  </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Secure VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> protects your privacy by turning on automatically for unsecured networks. Your data is encrypted so it can’t be read by prying eyes. The VPN also keeps your online activity and physical location private and secure from advertisers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Keeping an eye on your bills and statements as they come in can help you spot unusual activity on your accounts. A credit monitoring service can do that one better by keeping daily tabs on changes to your credit report. While you can do this manually, there are limitations. First, it involves logging into each bureau and doing some digging of your own. Second, there are limitations as to how many free credit reports you can pull each year. A service does that for you and without impacting your credit score.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Depending on your location and plan, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/products/mcafee-plus-ultimate.html#:~:text=Credit%20score%20and%20report%20updated%20daily?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee’s credit monitoring</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> allows you to look after your credit score and the accounts within it to see fluctuations and help you identify unusual activity, all in one place, checking daily for signs of identity theft.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Prevention and vigilance are your best defense from online banking scams </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When a fraud notification pops up on your phone, you can almost feel your stomach drop. Hackers and scammers play off that fear. They use it to get you to act—and to act quickly. Taking a moment to scrutinize these messages and following up directly with your bank can help you steer clear of their tricks. Likewise, putting up a strong defense with comprehensive online protection software can make you safer still. In the meantime, keep your eyes open for this “Pay Yourself Scam” and other scams like it. It’s certainly not the first of its kind, and it won’t be the last.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">A malware called Mars Stealer infiltrated several crypto wallet browser extensions, including the popular MetaMask. The malware stole private keys and then erased its tracks to mask that it had ever gained entry to the wallet.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How can you ensure a secure wallet? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to completely avoid a breach to your software crypto wallet is to opt for a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is a physical device that can only be opened with a PIN. But there is some risk involved with a hardware wallet: if you drop it down the drain, all your crypto is gone. If you forget your wallet PIN, there is no customer service chatbot that can help you remember it. You are solely responsible for keeping track of it. For those who are confident in their hardware’s hiding spot and their personal organizational skills, they can benefit from its added security.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For anyone less sure of their ability to keep track of a hardware wallet, a software wallet is a fine alternative, though always been on alert of software wallet hacks. Keep an eye on crypto news and be ready to secure your software at a moment’s notice. Measures include un-downloading browser extensions, changing passwords, or transferring your crypto assets to another software wallet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of the Mars Stealer malware that affected MetaMask, being careful about visiting secure sites and only clicking on trustworthy links could’ve helped prevent it. Mars Stealer made its way onto people’s devices after they clicked on an infected link or visited a risky website. Stick to websites you know you can trust and consider springing for well-known streaming services and paying for software instead of torrenting from free sources.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Only Trust Secure Bridges and Be Prepared to Act Quickly</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cryptocurrency enthusiasts often spread their crypto investments across various currency types and blockchain environments. Software known as a bridge can link numerous accounts and types, making it easier to send currency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What happened in the Horizon bridge hack?</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The cross-chain bridge Horizon experienced was on its Harmony blockchain, where a hacker stole about $100 million in Ethereum and tokens. The hacker stole two private keys, with which they could then validate this huge transaction into their own wallet. To hopefully prevent this from happening in the future, Horizon now requires more than just two validators.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How can you avoid crumbling bridges?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to one report, in 2022, 69% of all cryptocurrency losses have occurred in bridge attacks.</span><span data-contrast="auto">3</span><span data-contrast="auto"> If you exchange cryptocurrencies with other users and have various accounts, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll use bridge software. To keep your assets safe, make sure to extensively research any bridge before trusting it. Take a look at their security protocols and how they’ve responded to past breaches, if applicable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the case of Horizon, the stolen private keys were encrypted with a passphrase and with a key management service, which follows best practices. Make sure that you always defend your private keys and all your cryptocurrency-related accounts with multi-factor authentication. Even though it may not 100% protect your assets, it’ll foil a less persistent cybercriminal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishing attacks on bridge companies in conjunction with software hacks are also common. In this scenario, there’s unfortunately not much you can control. What you can control is how quickly and completely you respond to the cybercrime event. Remove the bridge software from your devices, transfer all your assets to a hardware wallet, and await further instructions from the bridge company on how to proceed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Never Trade Security for Convenience</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is now one of the riskiest aspects of cryptocurrency. DeFi is a system without governing bodies. Some crypto traders like the anonymity and autonomy of being able to make transactions without a bank or institution tracking their assets. The drawback is that the code used in smart contracts isn’t bulletproof and has been at the center of several costly cybercrimes. Smart contracts are agreed upon by crypto buyers and sellers, and they contain code that programs crypto to perform certain financial transactions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What happened in recent smart contract hacks?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Three multi-million-dollar heists – Wormhole, Beanstalk Farms and Ronin bridge – occurred in quick succession, and smart contracts were at the center of each.</span><span data-contrast="auto">4</span><span data-contrast="auto"> In the case of </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/3-tips-to-boost-your-crypto-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">Wormhole</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a cybercriminal minted 120,000 in one currency and then traded them for Ethereum without putting up the necessary collateral. In the end, the hacker cashed out with $320 million. Beanstalk Farms lost $182 million when a hacker discovered a loophole in the stablecoin’s flash loan smart contract. Axie Infinity’s </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/625-million-stolen-in-latest-crypto-attack-5-tips-on-how-to-use-digital-currency-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">Ronin bridge</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> was hit for $625 million when a hacker took control over and signed five of the nine validator nodes through a smart contract hole.</span><span data-contrast="auto">4</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">How can you avoid smart contract failures </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To be safe, conduct all crypto transactions on well-known and trustworthy software, applications, bridges, and wallets that are backed by a governing body. What you lose in anonymity you gain in security by way of regulated protocols. Hackers are targeting smart contracts because they do not have to depend on large-scale phishing schemes to get the information they need. Instead, they can infiltrate the code themselves and steal assets from the smartest and most careful crypto users. Because there’s almost no way you can predict the next smart contract hack, the best path forward is to always remain on your toes and be ready to react should one occur.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Enjoy Cryptocurrency but Keep Your Eyes Peeled</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Don’t let these costly hacks be what stops you from exploring crypto! Crypto is great as a side hustle if you’re committed to security and are strategic in your investments. Make sure you follow the best practices outlined and arm all your devices (mobile included!) with top-notch security, such as antivirus software, a VPN, and a password manager, all of which are included in </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">McAfee +</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

But unfortunately, that’s never been an option. Whether it’s been friendship issues in the playground, dramas on a messaging app or dealing with broken hearts, it can be really hard watching your kids experience hardship.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">But one thing I have learnt from years of mothering is that if you spend some time getting ahead of a potentially challenging situation then you’ve got a much better chance of minimising it. Or better still preventing it &#8211; and this absolutely applies to cyberbullying.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is Cyberbullying A Big Problem for Aussie Kids?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In early 2022, McAfee interviewed over 15,000 parents and 12,000 children worldwide with the goal of finding out how families both connect and protect themselves online. And what they found was astounding: Aussie kids reported the 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> highest rate of cyberbullying (24%) out of the 10 countries surveyed. American children reported the highest rate. The average for all countries was 17%.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As soon as your kids move on from just watching movies and playing games on their devices, you need to talk about the importance of ‘being nice’ online. A more natural way around this is to extend your parenting advice to include the online world too. For example: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And don’t forget the importance of role-modelling this too!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the best things you can do is to create a family culture where honest and genuine two-way communication is a feature of family life. If your kids know they can confide in you, that nothing is off-limits and that you won’t overreact &#8211; then they are more likely to open-up about a problem before it becomes overwhelming and ‘unsolvable’.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Parents who have a comprehensive understanding of their child’s life will be better able to detect when things aren’t going well. Knowing who your kid’s friends are, who they ‘sit with’ at lunchtime, their favourite music and their boyfriend or girlfriend needs to be a big priority. I also encourage parents to establish relationships with teachers or mentors at school so they can keep their ‘ear to the ground’. When a child’s behaviour and interests change, it can often mean that all isn’t well and that some detective work is required!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Cyberbullying can have a variety of definitions which can often cause confusion.

It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behaviour. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, I appreciate that reading your children several minutes of definitions may not be very helpful. So, instead, keep it simple and amend the above to make it age appropriate for your kids. You may choose to say that it is when someone is being mean online, if your kids are very young. But if you have tweens in the house then I think more details would be important. The goal here is for them to understand at what point they shouldn’t accept bad behaviour online. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As soon as your kids are actively engaged with others online, they need to have an action plan in case things go awry &#8211; probably around 6-7 years of age. In fact, I consider this to be a golden time in parenting – a time when your kids are receptive to your advice and often keen to please. So, this is when you need to help them establish good practices and habits that will hold them in good stead. This is what I would instil:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, of course not all bad behaviour online will be defined as cyberbullying – remember we all see the world through different lenses. However, what’s important here is that your kids ask for help when they experience something that makes them feel uncomfortable. And while we all hope that it is unlikely that you will need to escalate any interactions to the police or the eSafety Commissioner, knowing what the course of action is in case things get out of hand is essential. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">There is so much research on the connection between the lack of empathy and bullying behaviours. In her book </span><a href="https://micheleborba.com/speaking-topics/empathy-the-unselfie-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Unselfie, Parenting expert Michelle Borba</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> explains that we are in the midst of an ‘empathy crisis’ which is contributing to bullying behaviour. She believes teens today are far less empathetic than they were 30 years ago. Teaching your kids to ‘walk in someone’s else’s shoes’, consider how others feel and have a focus on compassion will go a long way to developing an empathetic lens. You can read more about helping develop empathy in your child </span><a href="https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/resources-for-families/5-tips-cultivating-empathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">here.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There is no doubt that cyberbullying is one of the biggest parenting challenges of our generation and, unfortunately, it isn’t going to disappear anytime soon. So, get ahead of the problem – teach your kids about kindness from a young age, create an open family communication culture, make empathy a priority in your family and give them an action plan in case things get tricky online. But most importantly, always listen to your gut. If you think things aren’t right with your kids – if they don’t want to go to school, seem emotional after using their devices or their behaviour suddenly changes, then do some digging. My gut has never let me down!    </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p>Our passion for protecting people doesn&#8217;t stop with online safety. We deeply care for our people, their families and friends, and our communities.</p>
<p>To recognize World Suicide Prevention on Sept. 10 and help normalize and encourage conversations about mental health year-round, we recently hosted a discussion with McAfee colleagues and suicide prevention activist and owner of The Jordan Legacy, Steve Phillip. During this session Steve discussed his own personal lived experience of suicide and what he’s learned since establishing The Jordan Legacy when it comes to creating an open and safe environment for all.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell us a bit about The Jordan Legacy?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“I established The Jordan Legacy in 2020, following the suicide of my 34-year-old son, Jordan, in December 2019. It’s a registered not-for-profit Community Interest Company (CIC), whose mission is to raise awareness about suicide, open the conversation, help remove the stigma surrounding this topic and importantly, engage with communities and workplaces to discuss and identify practical solutions which will help prevent suicide.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Why is World Suicide Prevention Day (WSPD) important?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“#WSPD is important in highlighting the biggest killer of men and women under the age of 35. According to the W.H.O, we lose 700,000 people globally to suicide every year &#8211; that&#8217;s one person every 45 seconds. On average, each suicide will impact 135 other people. This means that more than 95 million people are impacted by suicide annually! And while #WSPD is an important day to highlight, it&#8217;s fundamental that we recognize that suicide awareness needs to happen 365 days a year.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Why are there stigmas surrounding mental health and suicide?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“There are several reasons why stigmas surrounding mental health and suicide exist. Generally, it’s due to a lack of understanding and people making assumptions &#8211; such as those with a mental health illness could be dangerous, unreliable or unemployable. Cultural backgrounds also play a part in creating stigma – certain cultures see mental illness and suicide as a taboo subject. The language used around mental health and suicide can also create stigma. In the UK, the act of attempting suicide was decriminalized in 1961 and yet the term &#8216;committed suicide&#8217; is still frequently used, in the same way as commit murder or commit assault.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>How can we open-up a conversation and support someone who might be struggling with their mental health?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“It&#8217;s important to ask people how they are with a genuine intent to listen to and understand their reply. Most people who are struggling with their mental health don&#8217;t necessarily want you to fix them, but they do want to feel that they&#8217;re being listened to. Ask open-ended questions, such as &#8216;tell me how are you really feeling?&#8217;, &#8216;explain to me how this is impacting on you?&#8217;, &#8216;describe to me, how this is making you feel?”</em></p>
<h3><strong>How can we create hope through action – as family members, friends, and colleagues?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“We need to become a kinder and more compassionate society by recognizing that everyone can, at some point in their lives, struggle with poor mental health. Understanding this, would hopefully cause people to be less frustrated with others who don&#8217;t behave as they expect they might. We also need to check-in with family members, friends and colleagues more frequently and ask them &#8216;how are you really doing?” </em></p>
<h3><strong>How can we look after our own well-being?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“I am one of those individuals who probably works too hard and for too long! However, road cycling is a big escape for me and getting out in the fresh air in the countryside is a huge help. As is my part-time hobby of playing the drums &#8211; you can lose a lot of pent-up stress whilst playing along to Nirvana!! It’s so important that you make sure to look after yourself. So, my advice is to find out what works for you – whether that’s going for a walk, talking to a friend, speaking to a counsellor, joining a local group or seeing what resources are available to you through your company’s EAP. And remember most importantly to be kind to yourself.”</em></p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling, please call or text 988 to get support. And remember, you are not alone.</p>
<p>Together we can prevent suicide <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f49b.png" alt="💛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Started in 2010 by media and entertainment company Mashable, celebrations have taken on all kinds of forms. Meetups, contests, calls to increase your social circle by one meaningful connection have all marked the date in the past. Yet this year feels like an opportunity to consider just how heavily so many of us have leaned upon social media these past months, particularly in a world where </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/260811/social-network-penetration-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">nearly 50% of the global population are social media users</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to some degree or other.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What’s more, </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">people worldwide spend an average of 145 minutes a day on social media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. With users in the Philippines spending three hours and 53 minutes a day and users in the U.S. spending just over two hours a day, that figure can vary widely, yet it’s safe to say that a good portion of our day features time browsing around on social media.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With that, Social Media Day is also a good day to give your social media settings and habits a closer look, all so that you can get the most out of it with less fuss and worry. Whether you’re using Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or whatnot, here are several things you can do that can help<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> keep you safe and secure</a> out there:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Go private</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others give you the option of making your profile and posts visible to friends only. Choosing this setting keeps the broader internet from seeing what you’re doing, saying, and posting, which can help protect your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Say “no” to strangers bearing friend requests</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Be critical of the invitations you receive. Out-and-out strangers could be more than just a stranger, they could be a fake account designed to gather information on users for purposes of cybercrime, or they can be an account designed to spread false information. There are plenty of them too. In fact, in Q1 of 2021 alone, </span><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/fake-accounts/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Facebook took action on 1.3 billion fake accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Reject such requests.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Think twice before checking in</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nothing says “there’s nobody at home right now” like that post of you on vacation or sharing your location while you’re out on the town. In effect, such posts announce your whereabouts to a broad audience of followers (even a global audience, if you’re not posting privately, as called out above). Consider sharing photos and stories of your adventures once you’ve returned. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. The internet is forever</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s a famous saying for a reason. Whether your profile is set to private or if you are using an app with “disappearing” messages and posts (like Snapchat), what you post can indeed be saved and shared again. It’s as simple as taking a screenshot. If you don’t want it out there, forever or otherwise, simply don’t post it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Watch out for phishing scams</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re increasingly accustomed to the warnings about phishing emails, yet phishing attacks happen plenty on social media. The same rules apply. Don’t follow any links you get from strangers by way of instant or direct messengers. And keep your personal information close. Don’t pass out your email, address, or other info as well. Even those so-called “quiz” posts and websites can be ruses designed to steal bits and pieces of personal info that can be used as the basis of an attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. Review your tags</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some platforms such as Facebook allow users to review posts that are tagged with their profile names. Check your account settings and give yourself the highest degree of control over how and where your tags are used by others. This will help keep you aware of how you’re being mentioned by others and in what way.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">7. Protect yourself and your devices</span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Security software can protect you</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> from clicking on malicious links while on social media, strengthen your passwords so your social media account doesn’t get hacked, and boost your online privacy as well. </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/identity-protection/id-theft-faq?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">With identity theft a sadly commonplace occurrence today</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, security software is really a must.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Kids, as well as parents, can easily spend hours glued to the platform. But as with most popular platforms, the fun can eventually turn dark, even deadly, when viral challenges make their rounds.  </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The latest viral challenge, the “blackout challenge,” first became popular online in 2008 and made its unfortunate comeback in 2021. Before this second round, </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080214.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the CDC</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> attributed nearly 80 deaths to the dangerous online game. In the past month, authorities are attributing the tragic, </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/01/another-child-dies-from-viral-blackout-challenge-it-went-horribly-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">high-profile deaths</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> of Archie Battersbee, 12, and Leon Brown, 14 to the challenge. </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What is it?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The blackout challenge is a choking game that involves intentionally trying to choke oneself or another to obtain a brief euphoric state or “high.&#8221; Death or serious injury can result if strangulation is prolonged. Those doing the challenge do it privately or broadcast their attempt to friends or followers. The CDC also found that most deaths occurred when a child engaged in the choking game alone and that most parents were unaware of the game before their child’s death.</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">What’s the appeal?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s easy to look at a challenge like this and dismiss it thinking your child would never be involved in such a dangerous game. However, in a recent post from </span><a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Dangerous-Internet-Challenges.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">HealthyChildren.org</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> on why kids participate in online dares, pediatricians point to the reality that the teen brain is still developing. The part of the brain that processes rational thought, the prefrontal cortex, is not fully developed until a person’s mid-20s. This physiological reality means teens are naturally impulsive and can do things without stopping to consider the consequences. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another lure that entices teens is that social media’s fast-moving, impulsive environment rewards outrageous behavior—the more outrageous the content, the bigger the bragging rights. The fear of losing out (FOMO is natural for teens. </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">According to the CDC, signs that a child may be engaging in the blackout challenge include: </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">And those concerns have merit.

Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-personal-data-do-companies-track" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">online data brokers continue to buy and sell highly detailed personal profiles</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> with the data cobbled together from websites, apps, smartphones, connected appliances, and more, all as part of </span><a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24345.153%20billion%20in%202026." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global data-gathering economy estimated at well over $200 billion a year.</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet despite growing awareness of the ways personal information is collected, bought, sold, and even stolen, it remains a so</span><span data-contrast="auto">mewhat invisible problem. You simply don’t see it as it happens, let alone know who’s collecting what information about you and toward what ends—whether legal, illegal, or somewhere in between. A recent study we conducted showed that 74% of consumers are concerned about keeping their personal information private online. Yet, most of us have found out the hard way (when we search for our name on the internet) that there is a lot of information about us that has been made public. It is our belief that every individual should have the right to be private, yet we know too many individuals don’t know where to begin. It is this very worry that made us focus our new product line on empowering our users to take charge of their privacy and identity online.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Maybe it was a comment muttered in the heat of the moment that hurt someone’s feelings. Or maybe you just had a night out full of silly antics that you wouldn’t want your boss or grandma to see. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These are completely normal occurrences that happen all the time. We’re human! We make mistakes and letting loose every now and again is good for us. When these scenarios happen in person, we’re able to apologize or explain ourselves; however, the social media age complicates things. High-def cameras and video recorders are in everyone’s pocket, meaning that in-person slip-ups or lapses in judgement can come back to haunt you in a cyberscheme known as doxing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doxing can be harmful to one&#8217;s reputation and can cost someone their job, their friends, or their </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">privacy</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Doxing Defined</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The term doxing originated from the phrase “dropping documents/docs.” It refers to a situation where an enemy or a rival seeks to tarnish the reputation of someone else by releasing documents (aka dropping docs) about them. These documents often contain </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) –  like full names, birthdates, addresses, employment details, financial information, phone numbers, email addresses – and private correspondences or embarrassing videos or photos. The doxer – or the person dropping the documents – will publish these private details online, whether that’s on a forum, on social media, or a blog.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doxing is considered </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/more-dangers-of-cyberbullying-emerge-our-latest-connected-family-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">cyberbullying</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> because it is a form of online harassment. The doxer often does so with the intent of drumming up widespread hate about the victim and having the release of these private details negatively affect the victim’s life, such as getting them fired from their job or breaking up a relationship.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Doxing Can Happen to Anyone</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doxing happens most frequently to public figures, such as celebrities, politicians, streamers, and journalists. It is also a prevalent practice in the hacking community, where hackers reveal the identities of the real people behind forum usernames. However, anyone is susceptible to having their PII or sensitive photos or videos widely released on the internet for the sake of reputation sabotage. All it takes is for one scorned partner, a disgruntled coworker, or a disagreement to set a doxer on a warpath. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Doxing Isn’t Always Illegal</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When the saboteur doesn’t have to dig into your past via the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/what-is-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">dark web</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or through hacking a personal device, doxing isn’t illegal. It&#8217;s malicious and can be emotionally damaging, but there is no law stopping a doxer from publishing the private details of someone else. Doxing crosses the line into a crime when it is accompanied by threats. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if a doxer didn’t hack a personal device or buy the PII off the dark web, where did they find these details? Oftentimes, people incriminate themselves with their social media footprint. What seems like ancient history in your social media timeline is again front and center after just a few minutes of scrolling.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Sometimes the doxer is someone you know in real life, but other times it’s a stranger with whom you may or may not have crossed paths with online. One great rule of thumb is to not make enemies online. For example, if you disagree with someone online, be as respectful and polite to them as you would be if you were talking face to face.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

Not every site prioritizes security as much as we’d all hope, so it’s best to create online accounts with trustworthy organizations. To track down all your accounts, especially the ones you haven’t used in a while, one technique is to go through your email and make note of all the sites from which you receive notifications. This will provide you with a robust list of companies that have your information. This might be tedious, so don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t find them all. Consider splitting up the work over a few weeks to make it less of a chore.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/300x200_Blog_090822-300x203.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/300x200_Blog_090822-300x203.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/300x200_Blog_090822-191x129.png 191w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/300x200_Blog_090822.png 308w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Password protection is one of the most common security protocols available. By creating a unique password, you are both proving your identity and keeping your personal information safer. However, when every account you have requires a separate password, it can be an overwhelming task. While you should be concerned about the safety of your data, you also want to avoid the frustration of forgetting your password and being blocked from the information you need. However, the benefits of using strong, unique passwords outweigh the occasional inconvenience.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Strong Passwords</strong></h3>
<p>The main benefit of a <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/create-strong-passwords-with-a-password-generator/">strong password</a> is security. Hackers work quickly when they are trying to access accounts. They want to steal as much information as they can in as short a time as possible. This makes an account with a strong password less inviting because cracking the code is much more involved.</p>
<p>A strong password also limits the damage that hackers can do to your personal accounts. A common strategy involves cracking the passwords of less secure sites with limited personal information. The hackers hope that they can use the password from your gym membership app to access information in your online banking account. Strong password protection prevents this situation.</p>
<h3><strong>Common Poor Password Practices</strong></h3>
<p>When someone is registering an online account, it can be tempting to blaze through the password process. In order to move quickly, there are several poor password practices that people employ.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple passwords:</strong> Password-cracking programs start by entering obvious combinations. These are passwords where the user puts no thought into the code such as “password” or “1234567”.</li>
<li><strong>Repeated passwords:</strong> You may think you have such an unbreakable password that you want to use it for all of your accounts. However, this means that if hackers compromise one of your accounts, all of your other accounts are vulnerable.</li>
<li><strong>Personal information:</strong> The number combinations that you are apt to remember easily are the ones that hackers can find. You may have put your birthday or graduation year on public display in a social media account. Your dog’s name may be unusual, but if you share information about your canine friend with the world, its name is a weak password.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Meaning of a Strong Password</strong></h3>
<p>A password is considered strong when it is difficult for a hacker to crack it quickly. Sophisticated algorithms can run through many password combinations in a short time. A password that is long, complex and unique will discourage attempts to break into your accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long:</strong> The combinations that protect your accounts should be long enough that it would be difficult for a computer program to run through all the possible configurations. The four-digit pin on a bank card has 10,000 possible combinations. This might take some time for a human being to crack, but a computer program with unlimited tries could break it in a few seconds. If you were only using numbers, every character in your password would raise the possible combinations by a power of 10. To stump the algorithms, you want a password that is a minimum of 12 characters long.</li>
<li><strong>Complex:</strong> To increase the challenge of your password, it should have a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. Hacking algorithms look for word and number patterns. By mixing the types of characters, you will break the pattern and keep your information safe.</li>
<li><strong>Unique:</strong> If you have been reusing your passwords, it is time for you to start the work of changing them. Every one of your accounts should have its own password. At the very least, make certain that you have not reused passwords for your financial institutions, social media accounts and any work-related accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Creating a Layered Password</strong></h3>
<p>If you want a password that is memorable but strong, you can easily turn a phrase into a layered, complex password. In this process, it is important to note that you should not use personal information that is available online as part of your phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pick a phrase that is memorable for you:</strong> It should not be a phrase you commonly use on social media accounts. If you are an avid runner you might choose a phrase like, “Running 26.2 Rocks!”</li>
<li><strong>Replace letters with numbers and symbols: </strong>Remove the spaces. Then, you can put symbols and numbers in the place of some of the letters. Runn1ng26.2R0ck$!</li>
<li><strong>Include a mix of letter cases:</strong> Finally, you want both lower and uppercase letters that are not in a clear pattern. Algorithms know how to look for common patterns like camelCase or PascalCase. Runn1NG26.2R0cK$!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you have a password that you can remember while challenging the algorithms hackers use.</p>
<h3><strong>Employing a Password Manager</strong></h3>
<p>When you consider the number of accounts you need to protect, coming up with a properly layered password is a time-consuming task. Even if you are able to decide on a memorable phrase, there are just too many accounts that need passwords. A <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs">password manager</a> is a helpful tool to keep you safe while you are online. It acts as a database for all of your passwords. Each time you create a new code, it stores it so that you can automatically enter it later. You only need to remember a single password to access the tools of your manager.</p>
<p>Most managers can also do the work of creating complex, layered passwords for your accounts. These will be a string of random numbers, letters and characters. They will not be memorable, but you are relying on the manager to do the memorizing. These machine-generated passwords are especially helpful for accounts you rarely access or that do not hold significant information.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintaining an Offline Password List</strong></h3>
<p>For critical accounts like your bank account or a work-related account, it can be helpful to keep an offline list of your passwords. Complex passwords are meant to be difficult to remember. You may recall the phrase but not all the detailed changes that make it layered. Keeping a document on a zip drive or even in a physical paper file or journal will allow you to access your information if your hardware fails or you are switching to a new system.</p>
<h3><strong>Keeping the Whole System Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Cracking passwords is just one of the strategies hackers use to steal information. In addition to using strong passwords, it is important to employ comprehensive security software. Strong passwords will help protect your online accounts. Strong overall security will keep your hardware and network safe from danger.</p>

Most likely because the beloved milestone offers us a clean slate and a chance to do things better, shape new habits, and close those digital safety gaps.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The hope that fuels change is a powerful thing. However, if you want to ensure your new habits stick, there’s some science you might consider. </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-make-better-choices/202208/looking-different-and-better-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Psychologists</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> suggest that to make a new change permanent, you should start with smaller, micro-size choices that will lead to sustainable patterns and habits. Micro habits allow you to take safe steps that are too small to fail but effective enough to generate long-term change. </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Committing to Micro-Habits</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Breaking down the task online safety into bite-sized pieces is a great approach for parents eager to put better habits into play this year. Establishing new ground rules doesn’t have to include restrictions, tantrums, or tears. You can start small, commit to work together, and build your new habits over time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So often in this blog we offer a combination of practical digital tips proven to work such as robust </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/how-to-protect-your-social-media-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">password protocols</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, privacy settings, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">parental controls</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/getting-your-kids-ready-for-school-and-their-smartphones-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">smart phone protection</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and social network/app safety. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Today, however, we will flip that approach and give you some foundations that will no doubt support and amplify your family’s daily online safety efforts. Ready? Here we go!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">5 Foundations of Healthy Family Tech Habits</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">1. Put connection first.</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We’re all connected 24/7 but to what? Equipping kids to make wise decisions online begins with intentional, face-to-face connection at home with a parent or caregiver. When the parent-child relationship is strong, trust grows, and conversation flows. If and when a challenge arises, your child is more likely to turn to you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Micro-habit: If your family doesn’t eat dinner together, start with one night a week (stay consistent with the day). Make the dinner table a no-phone zone and spend that time together listening and connecting. Build from there. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">2. Step into their world. </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The new school year is a chance to get more involved with your child’s day-to-day communities (on and offline), including their teachers, friend groups, or hobbies. If you’ve been on the sidelines in the past, taking a few steps into their world can give you an exceptional understanding of their online life. Knowing where they go and who they know online has never been more critical, as outlined in our recent </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/more-dangers-of-cyberbullying-emerge-our-latest-connected-family-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Connected Family Report</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Micro-habit: Does your child have a favorite app? Download it, look around, and understand the culture. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">3. Prioritize sleep. </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Summer—coupled with extra time online (often unmonitored)—can wreak havoc on a child’s sleep patterns, which, in turn, wreaks havoc on a family. If you have a tween or teen, ensuring they get the required hours of sleep is a significant way to keep them safe online. Think about it. Fatigue can impair judgment, increase anxiety, impact grades, and magnify moodiness, putting a child’s physical and emotional wellbeing at risk online and off. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Micro-habit: Think about setting a phone curfew that everyone agrees on. Giving your child input into the curfew makes it less of a restriction and more of a health or lifestyle shift. Remember, your child’s device is their lifeline to their peers so cutting them off isn’t a long-term solution. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">4. Monitor mental health. </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With kids spending so much time on apps like </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/setting-up-parental-controls-in-tiktok-instagram-snapchat/"><span data-contrast="none">TikTok</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube, those platforms inevitably influence your child more than just about anyone. Be on the lookout for behavior changes in your child that may be connected to digital risks such as </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/more-dangers-of-cyberbullying-emerge-our-latest-connected-family-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">cyberbullying</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/sextortion-what-your-kids-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">sextortion</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/6-steps-to-help-your-family-restore-digital-balance-in-stressful-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">gaming addiction</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, inappropriate content, or connecting with strangers.</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Micro-habit: Consider </span></i><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span data-contrast="none">setting time limits</span></i></a><i><span data-contrast="none"> that allow your child to enjoy their online hangouts without being consumed or overly influenced by the wrong voices. Apply limits in small blocks at first and grow from there. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">5. Aim for balance. </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Balancing your online life with face-to-face activities and relationships is a must for your child’s physical and emotional wellbeing. But sometimes, striving for that balance can feel overwhelming. Being too stringent can cause big plans to collapse, sending our behaviors in the </span><i><span data-contrast="none">opposite</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> direction. Balance requires constant re-calibration and pausing to take those small bites. </span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="none">Micro-habit: Commit to one family outdoor activity together a month. Take a hike, learn to fish, take up tennis. Make the outings phone-free zones. Be consistent with your monthly micro-habit and build from there. </span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s been proven that any change you attempt to make ignites a degree of friction. And prolonged friction can discourage your efforts to stick to new habits. Ignore that noise and keep moving forward. Stay the course parents because this is the year your best intentions take shape.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

One of their newest schemes is called synthetic identity theft, a type of identity theft that can happen to anyone. Luckily, there are ways to lower the chance of it happening to you. And if it does happen to you, there are a few </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">preventive measures</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> you can take. Plus when you’re able to identify the early signs, you can minimize its damage to your finances and your credit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s everything you need to know about synthetic identity theft in order to keep your and your family’s information safe.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Is Synthetic Identity Theft?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Synthetic identity theft occurs when a cybercriminal steals a real Social Security Number (SSN) but fabricates the rest of the details that are associated with that SSN, such as the full name and birthdate. With this valid SSN, they’re able to create an entirely new identity and use it to take out loans, apply for credit cards, or even purchase a house. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This form of identity theft is more difficult than traditional identity theft to detect. When a criminal steals someone’s entire identity – their name, birthdate, address, and SSN – there are more flags that could raise the alarm that something is amiss. Additionally, in some cases of synthetic identity theft, cybercriminals play the long game, meaning that they build up excellent credit with their new fake identity for months or even years. Then, once they’ve squeezed as much as they can from that great credit, they rack up huge charges against that credit and flee. It is only then when creditors demand payment that the rightful owner of the SSN finds out their identity was compromised. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Synthetic identity theft can severely damage the credit or finances of the person to whom the SSN truly belongs. It most often occurs to people who don’t closely monitor their credit, such as children, people in jail, or the elderly, but it can happen to anyone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Signs Your Identity May Be Stolen</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The signs of synthetic identity theft are a bit different than the </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/9-ways-to-determine-if-your-identity-has-been-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">signs of regular identity theft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In traditional identity theft, you may receive bills to your address either with someone else’s name on them or for organizations with which you don’t have an account. However, in the case of synthetic identity theft, since the thief makes up an entirely new name and address, you’re unlikely to accidentally get their mail.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The major red flag is if your credit score is drastically lower (or higher) than you remember it being. Did you know that you can request one free credit report per year from each major credit bureau? Get in the habit of ordering reports regularly to keep tabs on your credit and confirm that there are no new accounts that you didn’t create.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

If anyone else requests your SSN, it’s not rude to inquire why they need it. In cases where you do have to share your SSN, never do so over electronic correspondences. Either visit the organization in person or call them in a private location that is clear of eavesdroppers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

This is a process where you reach out to the major credit bureaus and notify them to deny any new claims or requests made against your name or SSN. Locking your credit is a great preventive measure that can guard against many criminal scenarios.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

One way to protect your identity is to watch the headlines to keep tabs on recent breaches. If a company with which you have an account is affected, take action immediately. This includes changing your password to your account and diligently tracking your bank statements for any signs that you may have been affected.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></li>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Those are familiar words to a parent, especially if you’re having the first smartphone conversation with your tween or pre-teen. In their mind, everyone else has a smartphone so they want a one too. But does “everyone” really have one? Well, your child isn’t wrong. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our recent global study found that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/reports/rp-connected-family-study-2022-global.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">76% of children aged 10 to 14 reported using a smartphone or mobile device</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, with Brazil leading the way at 95% and the U.S. trailing the global average at 65%.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154532" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/children-total-age-by-country.png" alt="" width="624" height="238" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/children-total-age-by-country.png 624w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/children-total-age-by-country-300x114.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/children-total-age-by-country-205x78.png 205w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our figures show that younger children with smartphones and mobile devices make up a decisive majority of younger children overall.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Of course, just because everyone else has smartphone doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily right for your child and your family. After all, with a smartphone comes access to a wide and practically unfettered world of access to the internet, apps, social media, instant messaging, texting, and gaming, all within nearly constant reach. Put plainly, some tweens and pre-teens simply aren’t ready for that just yet, whether in terms of their maturity, habits, or ability to care for and use a device like that responsibly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Yet from a parent’s standpoint, a first smartphone holds some major upsides. </span><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2017/mobile-kids--the-parent-the-child-and-the-smartphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">One of the </span><span data-contrast="none">top reasons parents give a child a smartphone is “to stay in touch,”</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and that’s understandable. There’s something reassuring knowing that your child is a call or text away—and that you can keep tabs on their whereabouts with GPS tracking. Likewise, it’s good to know that they can reach you easily too. Arguably, that may be a reason why some parents end up giving their children a smartphone a little sooner than they otherwise would. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">However, you don’t need a smartphone to do to text, track, and talk with your child. You have alternatives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Smartphone alternatives</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One way to think about the first smartphone is that it’s something you ease into. In other words, if the internet is a pool, your child should learn to navigate the shallows with some simpler devices before diving into the deep end with a smartphone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Introducing technology and internet usage in steps can build familiarity and confidence for them while giving you control. You can oversee their development, while establishing rules and expectations along the way. Then, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/my-child-wants-a-phone-should-i-say-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">when the time is right, they can indeed get their first smartphone</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But how to go about that?</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It seems a lot of parents have had the same idea and device manufacturers have listened. They’ve come up with smartphone alternatives that give kids the chance to wade into the mobile internet, allowing them to get comfortable with device ownership and safety over time without making the direct leap to a fully featured smartphone. Let’s look at some of those options, along with a few other long-standing alternatives.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">GPS trackers for kids</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These small and ruggedly designed devices can clip to a belt loop, backpack, or simply fit in a pocket, giving you the ability to see your child’s location. In all, it’s quite like the “find my” functionality we have on our smartphones. When it comes to GPS trackers for kids, you’ll find a range of options and form factors, along with different features such as an S.O.S. button, “geofencing” that can send you an alert when your child enters or leaves a specific area (like home or school), and how often it sends an updated location (to regulate battery life). </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Whichever GPS tracker you select, make sure it’s designed specifically for children. So-called “smart tags” designed to locate things like missing keys and wallets are just that—trackers designed to locate things, not children.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Smart watches for kids</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With GPS tracking and many other communication-friendly features for families, smart watches can give parents the reassurance they’re looking for while giving kids a cool piece of tech that they can enjoy. The field of options is wide, to say the least. Smart watches for kids can range anywhere from devices offered by mobile carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and Vodaphone to others from Apple, Explora, and Tick Talk. Because of that, you’ll want to do a bit of research to determine the right choice for you and your child. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Typical features include restricted texting and calling, and you’ll find that some devices are more durable and more water resistant than others, while yet others have cameras and simple games. Along those lines, you can select a smart watch that has a setting for “school time” so that it doesn’t become a distraction in class. Also, you’ll want to look closely at battery life, as some appear to do a better job of holding a charge than others. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">Smartphones for kids</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another relatively recent entry on the scene are smartphones designed specifically for children, which offer a great step toward full-blown smartphone ownership. These devices look, feel, and act like a smartphone, but without web browsing, app stores, and social media. Again, features will vary, yet there are ways kids can store and play music, stream it via Bluetooth to headphones or a speaker, and install apps that you approve of. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Some are paired with a parental control app that allows you to introduce more and more features over time as your child as you see fit—and that can screen texts from non-approved contacts before they reach your child. Again, a purchase like this one calls for some research, yet names like Gabb wireless and the Pinwheel phone offer a starting point.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="none">The flip phone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The old reliable. Rugged and compact, and typically with a healthy battery life to boot, flip phones do what you need them to—help you and your child keep in touch. They’re still an option, even if your child may balk at the idea of a phone that’s “not as cool as a smartphone.” However, if we’re talking about introducing mobile devices and the mobile internet to our children in steps, the flip phone remains in the mix. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Some are just phones and nothing else, while other models can offer more functionality like cameras and slide-out keyboards for texting. And in keeping with the theme here, you’ll want to consider your options so you can pick the phone that has the features you want (and don’t want) for your child.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="none">Ease into that first smartphone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Despite what your younger tween or pre-teen might think, there’s no rush to get that first smartphone. And you know it too. You have time. Time to take eventual smartphone ownership in steps, with a device that keeps you in touch and that still works great for your child. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">By easing into that first smartphone, you’ll find opportunities where you can monitor and guide their internet usage. You’ll also find plenty of moments to help your child start forming healthy habits around device ownership and care, etiquette, and safety online. In all, this approach can help you build a body of experience that will come in handy when that big day finally comes—first smartphone day.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/300x200_Blog_090222-300x203.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/300x200_Blog_090222-300x203.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/300x200_Blog_090222-191x129.png 191w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/300x200_Blog_090222.png 308w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Fears and phobias. We all have them. But what are your biggest ones? I absolutely detest snakes but spiders don’t worry me at all. Well, new research by McAfee shows that cybercriminals and the fear of being hacked are now the 5<sup>th</sup> greatest fear among Aussies.</p>
<p>With news of data breaches and hacking crusades filling our news feed on a regular basis, many of us are becoming more aware and concerned about the threats we face in our increasingly digital world. And McAfee’s latest confirms this with hackers making their way into Australia’s Top 10 Fears.</p>
<p>According to research conducted by McAfee, snakes are the top phobia for Aussies followed by spiders, heights and sharks. Cybercriminals and the fear of being hacked come in in 5<sup>th</sup> place beating the dentist, bees, ghosts, aeroplane travel and clowns!</p>
<p><strong>Aussie Top 10 Fears and Phobias</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Snakes</li>
<li>Spiders</li>
<li>Heights</li>
<li>Sharks</li>
<li>Hackers/Cybercriminals</li>
<li>The dentist</li>
<li>Bees or wasps</li>
<li>Ghosts</li>
<li>Aeroplane travel</li>
<li>Clowns</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Why Do We Have Phobias? </strong></h4>
<p>Fears and phobias develop when we perceive that we are at risk of pain, or worse, still, death. And while almost a third of respondents nominated snakes as their number one fear, there is less than one-in-fifty thousand chance of being bitten badly enough by a snake to warrant going to hospital in Australia, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/imj.13297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research from the Internal Medicine Journal.</a></p>
<p>In contrast, McAfee’s analysis of more than 108 billion potential online threats between October and December,<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-dec-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> identified 202 million of these threats as genuine risks</a>. With a global population of 7.5 billion, that means there is approximately a one in 37 chance of being targeted by cybercrime. Now while this is not a life-threatening situation, these statistics show that chance of us being affected by an online threat is very real.</p>
<h4><strong>What Are Our Biggest Cyber Fears?</strong></h4>
<p>According to the research, 82% of Aussies believe that being hacked is a growing or high concern. And when you look at the sheer number of <a href="https://www.webberinsurance.com.au/data-breaches-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported data breaches so far this year</a>, these statistics make complete sense. Data breaches have affected Bunnings staff, Federal Parliament staff, Marriott guests, Victorian Government staff, QLD Fisheries members, Skoolbag app users and Big W customers plus many more.</p>
<p>Almost 1 in 5 (19%) of those interviewed said their top fear at work is doing something that will result in a data security breach, they will leak sensitive information or infect their corporate IT systems.</p>
<p>The fear that we are in the midst of a cyberwar is another big concern for many Aussies. Cyberwar can be explained as a computer or network-based conflict where parties try to disrupt or take ownership of the activities of other parties, often for strategic, military or cyberespionage purposes. 55% of Aussies believe that a cyberwar is happening right now but we just don’t know about it. And a fifth believe cyber warfare is the biggest threat to our nation.</p>
<h4><strong>What Can We Do to Address Our Fear of Being Hacked? </strong></h4>
<p>Being proactive about protecting your online life is the absolute best way of reducing the chances of being hacked or being affected by a data breach. Here are my top tips on what you can now to protect yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Be Savvy with Your Passwords</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a password manager to create unique and complex passwords for each of your online accounts will definitely improve your online safety. If each on your online accounts has a unique password and you are involved in a breach, the hacker won’t be able to use the stolen password details to log into any of your other accounts.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h5><strong>Stop AutoFill on Chrome</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Storing your financial data within your browser and being able to populate online forms quickly within seconds makes the autofill function very attractive however it is risky. Autofill will automatically fill out all forms on a page regardless of whether you can see all the boxes. You may just think you are automatically entering your email address into an online form however a savvy hacker could easily design an online form with hidden boxes designed to capture your financial information. So remove all your financial information from Autofill. I know this means you will have to manually enter information each time you purchase but your personal data will be better protected.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h5><strong>Think Before You Click</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the easiest ways for a cybercriminal to compromise their victim is by using phishing emails to lure consumers into clicking links for products or services that could lead to malware, or a phoney website designed to steal personal information. If the deal seems too good to be true, or the email was not expected, always check directly with the source.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h5><strong>Stay Protected While You Browse</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to put the right security solutions in place in order to surf the web safely. Add an extra layer of security to your browser with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-au/store/m0/catalog/mwad_528/mcafee-web-advisor.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McAfee WebAdvisor</a>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h5><strong>Always Connect with Caution</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I know public Wi-Fi might seem like a good idea, but if consumers are not careful, they could be unknowingly exposing personal information or credit card details to cybercriminals who are snooping on the network. If you are a regular Wi-Fi user, I recommend investing in a virtual private network or (VPN) such as<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> McAfee Secure VPN </a>which will ensure your connection is completely secure and that your data remains safe.</p>
<p>While it is tempting, putting our head in the sand and pretending hackers and cybercrime don’t exist puts ourselves and our families at even more risk! Facing our fears and making an action plan is the best way of reducing our worry and stress. So, please commit to being proactive about your family’s online security. Draw up a list of what you can do today to protect your tribe. And if you want to receive regular updates about additional ways you can keep your family safe online, check out my <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/author/cybermum-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For some time now, we’ve recommended a VPN when using public Wi-Fi in airports, libraries, hotels, and coffee shops. Given that these are public networks, a determined hacker can snoop on the other devices transmitting data on it. With a VPN, any connection becomes a secure connection, which includes public Wi-Fi. That advice still holds true. Yet there’s a good reason to use it on your smartphone all the time—for your privacy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s start with a quick look at the two big things a VPN does for you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">It makes you more secure.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The bank-grade encryption used by a strong VPN shields your data and information while it’s in transit, which makes it terrifically difficult for hackers to spy on your connection. (Think of your data and information traveling through a tunnel that no one else can use or see into.) In that way, at VPN makes all kinds of online activities more secure—like banking, shopping, and checking up on your finances. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">It protects your privacy.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By masking your whereabouts and your IP address, along with encryption that helps keep your activities private, a VPN reduces the personal information that others can collect and track. That includes internet service providers, social media companies, businesses, app developers, websites, and others who gather your data for marketing purposes or for resale to third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Your smartphone, your privacy, and a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As far as your privacy is concerned, a VPN on a smartphone can be a smart move. There are a couple of reasons for that: first, because of the way smartphones have additional tracking technologies built in, and second, because of all the trackable data we create when </span><span data-contrast="auto">using smartphones as frequently as we do—up to six hours per day</span><span data-contrast="auto"> for some.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As for how your smartphone is built, data collectors can harvest your personal information that reveals what you’re doing, when you’re doing it, </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">and where you’re doing it</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> as well. Several technologies allow them to pinpoint where you are at any given time, such as GPS and location services, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">along with Bluetooth connectivity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and location tracking based on which cell phone tower you’re connected to. Even scanning a QR code with your phone can reveal location information. It can all get rather precise, which is of interest to advertisers, businesses, and even </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/new-records-detail-dhs-purchase-and-use-of-vast-quantities-of-cell-phone-location-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">governments</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Next, think about all the activities you do on your phone, with a special emphasis on the apps you use and the data they create, about your health, your shopping habits, your travels, who you’re chatting with, and what content you’re posting online—just to name a few things. Once again, that information in of itself is valuable to data collectors. It becomes even more valuable when they know </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">where</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> you do these things. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taken together, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-data-brokers-sell-your-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">data broker companies readily gather this information from millions of devices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, generating billions of data points, and create massive lists of targeted information. And that information gets quite specific. With some data brokers collecting hundreds and into the thousands of data points per person, they can provide interested buyers with a high-resolution snapshot of who you are, where you live, who’s in your family, your income, where you shop, what you like to buy—right on down to your favorite shampoo. And that’s just for starters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s little surprise that all this data brokering activity fuels </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-05/column-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">a global business estimated at $200 billion U.S. dollars a year</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">How’s this happening? In large part by way of the privacy policies you may or may not have read.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Within those policies, device manufacturers, social media companies, app developers, and so on will detail what data they collect, under what conditions, what they do with it, and if they share or resell that data to other parties. However, if you’ve ever taken a dive into the fine print of a privacy policy, what’s stated there isn’t always clear. Now consider all the apps you have on your phone and the privacy policies associated with each one—your personal data privacy picture gets even less clear.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With digital data and information collection baked into so much of what we do online, it’s little wonder that </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/#:~:text=Why%20Personal%20Data%20Cleanup%20matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">more than 70% of people feel like their data privacy is out of their control</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yet there are things you can do.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Protect your privacy on your smartphone with a VPN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Using a VPN on your smartphone can make you far more anonymous online</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. A VPN can minimize the data that gets exposed as it transmits to and from your smartphone. As a result, companies and data brokers can potentially learn far less about you, your shopping, your travels, your habits, and any other information that they could possibly collect and otherwise profit from.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While you have free VPN options available, I suggest steering clear of them. As with many “free” services, there’s going to be some catch, often involving data collection. For example, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">some so-called &#8220;free VPNs” have served up tracking malware or actually </span><i><span data-contrast="none">collected </span></i><span data-contrast="none">private data and information for sale</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—the very things you want a VPN to prevent. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Given that this is your privacy we’re talking about, do a little background check. Has the VPN you’re considering been independently audited for security? </span><a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear-completes-5th-annual-independant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The technology that powers ours undergoes a thorough audit every year.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> Search news articles and see if the VPN you’re looking at has a track record of collecting and selling data in any way. Again, with our VPN technology, we don&#8217;t log or track what you do online so your online activity remains private. ​</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">And a Personal Data Cleanup too …</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What about the information that’s already out there? Our </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/personal-data-cleanup/?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Personal Data Cleanup can help you remove your personal information from high-risk data broker sites</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, so you can prevent it from being further collected and sold online. If you’re unsure if your data and information are out there, </span><a href="https://sites.sanford.duke.edu/techpolicy/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/08/Data-Brokers-and-Sensitive-Data-on-US-Individuals-Sherman-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">consider what one major data brokers has touted in the past</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">—a reach of over 62 countries and the ability to reach over 2.5 billion consumers globally. With 5 billion internet users today, that accounts for half of the world’s online population. And that’s just one data broker alone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, consider that data brokers acquire plenty of information from places other than your smartphone and other connected devices. They skim and collate public records associated with you, information purchased from retailers with loyalty card programs, not to mention census data, court records, and motor vehicle records. And that’s just a few of the many sources. Using our Personal Data Cleanup can help remove those sorts of records too. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Getting more privacy on your smartphone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Together, the combination of a VPN and Personal Data Cleanup can help you become far more private than before. With so much of our digital lives getting collected, tracked, and tabulated, often without our knowledge thanks to confusing privacy policies, taking control of your privacy makes sense and only gets easier to do thanks to the tools and services available to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Spam and bot accounts on social media are everywhere. You’ve likely encountered messages like these that attempt to get you to click on links or to stir your emotions in a frenzy. While bot accounts are usually more of an annoyance than anything, when they’re allowed to run rampant, they can quickly become </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">dangerous to your personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII) and create an emotionally charged mob mentality.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Here’s what you should know about bot accounts, including how to steer clear of menacing ones, plus a reminder to watch what you share on (and with) social media sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bot accounts are software-automated accounts that try to blend in and act like a real user. They post updates and follow other users, though there isn’t a real person behind the account. A spam account is a type of bot account that attempts to gain financially from its automated posts. Everyday people should be wary of social media bot accounts because they can be used to </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/beware-of-social-media-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">disseminate false information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or phishing scams. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">One whistleblower of a social media giant recently divulged that the platform isn’t prioritizing deactivating bot accounts.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> This apathy sparks concerns about the company’s commitment to the security of its users. In the whistleblower’s same report, he stated that the social media site isn’t taking the necessary steps to protect itself from potential inside threats and it had fallen victim to at least 20 breaches in 2020 without reporting the incidents to the proper authorities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some bot accounts aren’t malicious (merely an annoying tactic by companies to spread the word about their business), but it’s best to give all of them a wide berth and never click on any links in their posts. Those links could direct to unsecured outside sites laden with malware or drop you in the middle of a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/protect-yourself-against-phishing-scams-with-these-security-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">phishing scheme</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can often spot a malicious bot account by the tone of its messages. They’ll often try to inspire intense emotions, such as excitement, sadness, or rage, and attempt to get users to act or share the post. Do not engage with them, not even to argue their points. When you engage or share these posts with your network, it spreads false information and could dangerously manipulate public opinion.</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

To combat social engineering, you may want to set your account to private so strangers can’t lurk and glean valuable personal details. Also, deny follower or friend requests from people you don’t know in real life. It could be a bot account in disguise. Another option: don’t overshare!

<h2><strong>A typical day </strong></h2>
<p>I’m an Internal Audit Manager. Essentially, I work with my McAfee colleagues to understand the processes we follow and run tests to confirm everything is happening as it should.</p>
<p>Sometimes people find audits intimidating, but I do my best to reassure people that there are no hidden tricks and I respect their time. We’re just making sure things are going according to plan and we’re fulfilling our responsibilities.</p>
<p>In a typical day, I have three priorities: Dad, Work, Gym.</p>
<p>I’m normally up at 6 a.m. to cook breakfast for my son and myself, and then drop him off at school. His favorite is bacon and eggs! Since I work with people around the world, I catch up on emails and then review the day’s work and catch up with my team. From there, most of my day is spent in meetings with McAfee colleagues or external auditors.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the day I get in a one-hour workout. It’s tough to do sometimes, but I’d say I get to the gym 90% of the time. It’s a great reset for me: a time where I can focus on me and putting my body to the test.</p>
<p>And, of course, I pick up my son from school and have Dad Time! That’s really my day in repeat. It seems like the same thing but feels different every day. I’m always meeting new people and puzzling through different problems. Every day is a fresh challenge.</p>
<h2><strong>Joining McAfee </strong></h2>
<p>After interviewing with my future co-workers, I was excited to join the company. I thought, “<em>Oh, this company is fun</em>!” The culture seemed to be a place where not only do you get to come for work, but also have sense of community within it.</p>
<p>Also, it was a chance to work for a great boss. I knew she was a great boss because I worked for her before. She gives you the vision, then gives you the freedom to explore and get the work done. You really get to own your work. I appreciate that.​​</p>
<p>At McAfee, employees are a top priority. You’re not just a robot who has to work-work-work. It’s okay to have fun and take 10 minutes out to see how others are doing.</p>
<p>I like the way the company comes together to have contests and other fun activities. In Finance, we recently had a scavenger hunt with 70 people. It was great seeing the faces of people you’ve only talked to on the phone.</p>
<p>Another way we engage each other is with a recognition program called Bravo! You can write a letter to someone saying hey, I appreciate you. That makes you feel more valued as an employee.</p>
<p>I also like the quarterly updates we get from leaders. At other companies, I’ve seen that done once a year. It’s nice to hear from the CEO every quarter about what’s going on in the organization.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
<h2><strong>Learning and MAHC</strong></h2>
<p>There are two parts that make my role so rewarding. The first is I enjoy interacting with people and have a passion for learning. In this job, you hear so many cool stories, and I’m exposed to so many different areas and processes in across the business. There’s always something new to learn. It makes every day different.</p>
<p>Secondly, at McAfee I’m part of the McAfee African Heritage Community (MAHC). We get together and talk about things we want to share with other Community members and the rest of McAfee. I’ve met people I never would run into otherwise. That’s important to me as someone who’s fairly new to McAfee plus having worked remote all this time. It’s very cool to be part of a company that supports having communities.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
<h2><strong>Getting outside my comfort zone</strong></h2>
<p>Honestly, my job is always outside my comfort zone. There’s always a new problem to be solved. But I like that. The way I see it, if you’re comfortable, you aren’t growing. You need to do something you haven’t done before to move to the next level.</p>
<p>As an auditor, I’m always helping others understand the audit process and how to provide solid information, so the audit goes well.</p>
<h2><strong>​​​​​​​Communication is key</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most helpful skills I have developed during my career is communication. I need to establish a rapport quickly in my work so we can work well together. Everybody is different, right? Some are more direct, some are more indirect, and some people are more casual than others. You always need to adjust when you meet people. Good communication skills help prevent misunderstandings, which is especially important in a global company like McAfee with so many different cultures.</p>

<h2><strong>My advice to anyone looking to drive their career forward is… </strong></h2>
<p>Embrace change! Change is just another way to grow, learn, and realize potential you didn’t know you had. Look at it as an opportunity. Raise your hand up when problems arise and take on that tough problem. The person who fixes the problem is the person everyone remembers.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Companies who buy data from brokers use it for things like marketing or risk mitigation.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, like </span><span data-contrast="auto">computer viruses</span><span data-contrast="auto">, our phones can be vulnerable to </span><span data-contrast="auto">malware</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Viruses are a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/iphone-ios-hacks/"><span data-contrast="none">type of malware</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that replicate themselves and spread throughout the entire system. They can affect your phone’s performance or, worse, compromise your sensitive information so that </span><span data-contrast="auto">hackers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can benefit monetarily.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In this article, we give you a rundown of viruses that can infect your phone and how you can identify and eliminate them.

<h2 aria-level="2"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Can </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">iPhone</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">Android devices</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> get viruses?</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">iPhones</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><span data-contrast="auto">Android devices</span><span data-contrast="auto"> run on different </span><span data-contrast="auto">operating systems</span><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Viruses have a harder time penetrating </span><span data-contrast="auto">iOS</span><span data-contrast="auto"> because of its design (although </span><a href="https://www.clearscope.io/fractl/reports/8b29930a6fe75fae/optimize"><span data-contrast="none">iOS hacks</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can still happen). By restricting interactions between apps, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Apple</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">operating system</span><span data-contrast="auto"> limits the movement of an </span><span data-contrast="auto">iPhone virus</span><span data-contrast="auto"> across the device. However, if you </span><span data-contrast="auto">jailbreak</span><span data-contrast="auto"> your </span><span data-contrast="auto">iPhone</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><span data-contrast="auto">iPad</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to unlock tweaks or install </span><span data-contrast="auto">third-party apps</span><span data-contrast="auto">, then the security restrictions set by </span><span data-contrast="auto">Apple</span><span data-contrast="auto">’s OS won’t work.

As your child grows and changes, so too will their online activities. Friend groups, favorite apps, and online interests can shift from one month to the next, which is why parental controls can be a parent’s best friend.  </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to a </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-census-8-to-18-full-report-updated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">report from Common Sense Media</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, teens spend an average of seven hours and 22 minutes on their phones a day. Tweens (ages 8 to 12) spend four hours and 44 minutes daily. This is time outside of schoolwork. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">That is a lot of time to stroll the streets of cyberspace for entertainment purposes, and it&#8217;s only </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/6-steps-to-help-your-family-restore-digital-balance-in-stressful-times/?hilite=%27time%27%2C%27limits%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">increased since the pandemic.</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Raising the Safety Bar </span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Parental controls are tools that allow parents to set controls on their children’s internet use. Controls include content filters (inappropriate content), usage limits (time controls), and monitoring (tracking activity).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many of the technology your family already owns or sites your kids visit have basic parental controls (i.e., built-in controls for </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/digital-parenting-how-to-keep-the-peace-with-your-kids-online/?hilite=%27kids%27%2C%27online%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">android and iPhone</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and social networks such as YouTube). However, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">another level of parental control</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> comes in software specifically engineered to filter, limit, and track digital activity. These consumer-designed parental controls offer families a higher, more powerful form of protection. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"> If you are like many parents who land on this blog, you’ve hit a rough patch. You have concerns about your child’s online activity but aren’t sure how to begin restoring balance. Rightly, you want to find the best parental control software and put digital safeguards in place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Depending on your child’s age, you may need to consider parental controls if: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">If your child is increasingly engrossed in their phone and it’s causing communication issues in your family, you may want to consider software that includes time limits. Connecting with your child during device-free time can improve communication. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">There are a lot of reasons grades can plummet, or interests can fade. However, if your child is spending more and more time online, limiting or monitoring what goes on in that time can help restore emotional balance and self-discipline to meet responsibilities. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="none">Innocent online searches can lead to not so innocent results or children may go looking for content simply because they&#8217;re curious. Parental controls automatically block age-inappropriate sites and filter websites, apps, and web searches. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">If the phone has become the center of your child’s world at the cost of parental respect and family rules, they may be engaged in inappropriate behavior online, connecting with the wrong friends, or struggling with tech balance. With the proper parental controls, a parent can block risky content, view daily activity, and set healthy time limits. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">Poor habits form quietly over time. If your child has dramatically changed their focus in the past three to six months, consider zooming in on why. It may not be technology use, but you may consider an additional layer of protection if it is.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b><span data-contrast="auto">6. They go into another room to respond to a text </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">While everyone deserves privacy, if constantly sneaking away to communicate with a friend is your child’s new norm, you may consider making some screen time adjustments. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-contrast="auto">If you browse through your child’s social media and notice their profiles are public instead of private, or if your child tends to overshare personal information, parental controls can help you monitor future activity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Ideally, we’d all prefer to live in a world where we didn’t need parental controls at all. Unfortunately, that is neither a present nor future reality. So, we recalibrate, keep learning, and keep adding to our parenting skills. As always, we believe the first go-to digital safety tool is investing in consistent open and honest conversation with your child. And the second tool? Yup, reach for the parental controls. While you may hear some hemming and hawing from your kids at first, the peace of mind you gain from having parental controls in place will be worth it. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p>Reflecting on 2021, it’s easy to see it was a monumental year for McAfee. Our business underwent an incredible transformation — <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=8dccd16a-8ff6-4044-b9f1-d171c5841bba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we divested our Enterprise business</a> and McAfee emerged as a worldwide leader for online protection, empowering individuals and families to live a safer life online. We also kicked off our journey to become a privately held company.</p>
<h2><strong>Our strides toward a better future </strong></h2>
<p>As we accelerate our journey as a dedicated consumer business and I evaluate our strides since our first report in 2018, I am humbled by our progress. In the last year, we’ve seen our representation for women reach 30.9% overall and for underrepresented professionals reach 14.8 percent. In addition, we’ve seen a 40% increase in the proportion of women promoted to director and above in the last year.</p>
<p>We maintained pay parity for women globally and underrepresented professionals in the U.S with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-years-pay-parity-mcafee-lessons-maintaining-equality-lynch/?trackingId=7RBXX9%2F6QomCgEVDNRPspA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our most recent audit revealing no disparities</a>. We rolled out a new inclusion and awareness training and were recognized as the best company for multicultural women and dads. We prioritized our people’s well-being with a rollout of the Calm app, fitness challenges, and a week focused on wellness.</p>
<p>All the while, McAfee rose to meet the increased needs of our community with laptop donation programs and employee giving campaigns. We also made progress for sustainability redefining how and where we work.</p>
<h2><strong>The opportunities ahead to do better </strong></h2>
<p>However, it’s not lost on me that 2021 followed a year fraught with challenges that didn’t disappear with the end of 2020. And today, we continue to live and work against the backdrop of a global pandemic, respond to acts of racial injustice, and hear undeniable lived experiences of hate and intolerance.</p>
<p>It’s fueled our desire to do better. We know there is so much work to do and our responsibility to create an equitable workplace and world has never been greater. It’s the right thing to do and a business imperative—we rely on the fresh ideas and unique perspectives of the people of McAfee. Truthfully, it’s their tenacity and resiliency that inspire me.</p>
<p>Whether it’s showing up for one another during a COVID-19 surge, asking for more resources to become a better ally, or rallying around each other to prioritize health, our people are exceptional.</p>
<p>As we progress in 2022, grow as a consumer-focused business, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220524005990/en/McAfee-Appoints-Greg-Johnson-as-President-Chief-Executive-Officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">welcome our new President and CEO Greg Johnson</a>, we will have the opportunity to take all we’ve learned and help turn our aspirations into reality. We will invest in our people, our community, and our planet, but also ask what we can do better.</p>
<p>I invite you to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/inclusion-diversity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read our 2021 Impact Report</a> to see our progress and our commitment.</p>

Can you feel it? Summer is so close. Everything feels a little more buoyant, a little brighter. We’re in the home stretch of social distancing, a sense of normalcy is returning, and there’s a collective energy that’s ready to throw the screen door open, run outside, and pounce on summer.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt you’ve established great digital ground rules that worked well during quarantine. However, as we begin the mental trek toward some degree of our former life, summer may be the perfect window to think about a digital reset.</p>
<p>A reset is simply taking a moment to pause, assess, and adjust where it makes sense. Consider what digital expectations and ground rules you established during the pandemic, what worked for your family, and what needs to be phased out before the new school year approaches.</p>
<h3><strong>Where we’ve been</strong></h3>
<p>We know that during quarantine (and even after), kids’ <a href="https://www.axios.com/kids-screen-time-coronavirus-562073f6-0638-47f2-8ea3-4f8781d6b31b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screen time doubled</a> for several reasons, including learning from home, needing to connect with friends online more, and boredom. During the pandemic, we also knew that helping kids <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/balancing-digital-helping-your-family-manage-ongoing-stress/?hilite=%27depression%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage the ongoing stress</a> of homebound life was crucial for helping them maintain digital, emotional, and physical health. All of these factors impacted our digital routines and expectations.</p>
<h3><strong>Where we’re going                 </strong></h3>
<p>Summer routines will look different for every family. Some students are attending school on site throughout the summer as many districts strive to bridge 2020 learning losses. Other students will enjoy a traditional summer break before starting back to school in a few months.</p>
<p>Whichever way your family’s summer routine rolls out, here are a few small shifts you can begin making today that will slowly help you re-establish smart digital habits.</p>
<h3><strong>5 ways to reset your digital habits</strong></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Pause, assess, adjust.</strong>  Stop to evaluate the role technology has grown to occupy in your home over the past year. Assess your family’s screen time and device habits that shifted or grew. Where do you need to help your kids slowly pull back? How many hours a day do the kids play video games? How much TikTok or YouTube scrolling is going on? Are the TV binges out of control? Is there still a phone curfew in place, or have kids <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/dangerous-digital-rituals-is-your-child-sleep-deprived/?hilite=%27sleep%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started taking their phones to bed</a>?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Give parental controls a go. </strong> If you gave your kids a little more device freedom during the pandemic and put the idea of  <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parental controls</a> on hold, summer is a great time to give this option a go. Test monitoring features, content filters, and make adjustments that fit your family’s needs. If your goal for your kids is less device time and more outside time this summer, parental controls include screen limits to help you reset any poor habits that have set in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Safety and Privacy revamp.</strong> During summer especially, take time to understand the friends your kids connect with online – new friend groups can form over the summer. Review privacy and location settings on apps. Teens often leave their location on for one another so they can find things to do. This practice isn’t always a good idea since <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/family-safety/what-parents-need-to-know-about-the-popular-app-mappen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">location-based apps</a> can open your family up to risks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Screen-free zones.</strong>  Another wise habit that may have gone by the wayside is creating screen-free zones such as the dinner table, the bedroom<u>, </u>restaurants, and family trips. Setting a tech curfew is also a great way to help kids get into consistent sleep patterns. These few steps can add hours of family time to your day and give kids a much-needed device break. If you are going on vacation, creating screen-free zones on your trip will ensure you are fully engaged and don’t miss out on the experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Get a plan.</strong>  The summer has a way of flying by, especially if kids end up playing video games, watching YouTube videos, or chatting on social media all day. Get in front of that temptation with a plan. Collaborate on a wish list of things every family member would like to do over the summer. Maybe it&#8217;s canoeing, a trip somewhere fun, a family project, volunteering, or a new hobby that taps into their creativity.</p>
<p>As you ease back into new habits, remember to share your reasoning for the reset. Handing down digital edicts rarely sticks, but when kids understand the mental and physical benefits of balancing their technology, they will be more likely to get on board with the change.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="203" src="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_Blog_082622-300x203.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_Blog_082622-300x203.png 300w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_Blog_082622-191x129.png 191w, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/300x200_Blog_082622.png 308w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>More and more social platforms are coming up with safer ways for younger kids to access their apps. The most recent announcement comes from Facebook who is reportedly creating a version of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/24/instagram-kids-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram for kids</a> 13 and under.</p>
<p>It’s a family safety win to see so many companies (YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook have parental control channels) making changes. That’s because currently, kids under 13 have no problem getting around an app’s age restrictions, a decision that can expose them to risks such as cyberbullying, stranger connections, and inappropriate content.</p>
<p>With apps making an overall shift toward safer experiences, areas of concern for families still exist especially since kids are increasingly connecting with social media companies before they enter middle school. Here are just a few things to consider as your child moves into the world of social networking, regardless of his or her age.</p>
<h3><strong>Family Talking Points</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The emotional side of social. </strong>Not all social networks work the same. Instagram is photo-based, which means a child’s experience may impact self-esteem and mental health more so than a network that is solely text-based. Consider talking to your child about the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risks often associated with Instagram</a> such as body image, cyberbullying, mental health issues. Regardless of age, it’s important to keep close tabs on a child’s mental health if they spend time online.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Talk about the risks. </strong>The years before kids begin using the trendier social networks, is a critical window to have honest, age-appropriate conversations. Consider discussing what kinds of things to look out for online, including bullying, predatory behavior, and inappropriate content.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Explain monetization. </strong>While social networks are a way of life for teens today, there’s so much more going on behind the scenes. Consider discussing the concept of monetization with your kids so they are aware of the businesses churning behind social networks. Cultivating the next generation of untapped users is a huge piece of a tech company’s strategy. Creating safer avenues for younger kids is a win for parents. However, introducing kids to a platform as early as possible is a big win for tech companies as well.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Discuss personal privacy. </strong>One of the biggest risks to kids online — and often the one kids care about the least — is privacy and how social networks collect and use kids’ data. It’s never<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span>too early to start talking about privacy and ways to <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/15-easy-effective-ways-to-start-winning-back-your-online-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reign in your family’s digital footprint</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Start building digital skills. </strong>The tween years are critical to preparing your child to eventually spend more time on social platforms for kids over 13. In addition to privacy, consider other important topics such as <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/7-conversations-to-help-develop-your-familys-digital-literacy-iq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital literacy</a>, cyberbullying, <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/4-ways-to-help-your-family-combat-cyber-threats-in-the-new-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online scams</a>, why <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/parental-controls/mcafee-safe-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parental controls</a> matter, and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/consumer/family-safety/5-reasons-why-strong-digital-parenting-matters-more-than-ever/?hilite=%27toni%27%2C%27birdsong%27%2C%27AND%27%2C%27cyberbullying%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other important digital skills</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The window between 9-12 is an important one when it comes to teaching kids digital skills and influencing their digital behavior. It’s never too early to begin these conversations. Remember, kids need aware, digitally savvy parents more than ever to prepare them for the challenges ahead.</p>

If you are after tips and strategies to help your kids navigate the Metaverse safely then you’re in the right place. In this post I’ll share with you how your kids are likely already accessing the Metaverse, the benefits plus how to ensure they have a safe and positive experience. Now, if you’d like a refresher on exactly what the Metaverse is before we get underway, then check out part one here.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Many Kids Are Using The Metaverse?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your kids have played Roblox, Fortnite or Minecraft then they have already taken the step into this new virtual frontier. Yes, it’s that easy! But how many kids are playing on these platforms? </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if you’ve got a couple of kids, tweens or teens in your house, then chances are they have probably already had a Metaverse experience! Or, if not yet, then it won’t be long…</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Is There Any Difference Between Video Games And The Metaverse?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are actually a lot of similarities between online video games and the Metaverse including the use of avatars and the availability of items to purchase eg a horse in a game or an NFT (non-fungible token) in the Metaverse. However, the biggest difference is that the Metaverse is not just about gaming – it is so much more. In the Metaverse, there are no limitations to the number of participants nor on the type of activity – you can attend meetings, concerts, socialise without the gaming aspect, even undertake study!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Are The Benefits Of The Metaverse For Our Kids?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are so many good things about the Metaverse for our kids, particularly from an educational perspective. As a mum of 4, I am really excited at the possibilities the Metaverse will offer our kids. Imagine being able to experience a country in virtual reality – walk around, see the sights, its geographical features. I have no doubt that would enthuse even the most reluctant learners. </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-022-09675-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">And a recent US study confirmed this</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. It found that taking students on a Virtual Reality field trip to Greenland to learn about climate change resulted in higher interest, enjoyment and retention than students who simply watched a traditional 2-D video. How good!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Taking care of my family’s mental health has always been a huge focus of my parenting approach and I am really excited at the great options the Metaverse can offer in the area. As a family, we’ve spent multiple hours using apps like </span><a href="http://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Calm</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="http://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Headspace</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to help us meditate and practice mindfulness. But the thought of being able to don a VR headset and be transported to the actual rainforest or the roaring fire that I often listen to, is even more appealing! One of the best parts of the VR experience is that it completely blocks out the ‘real world’ which would make it easier to stay in the flow. Very appealing!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And while we’re talking benefits, let’s not gloss over the potential role the Metaverse can play in fostering empathy and promoting understanding between communities. </span><a href="https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/how-does-technology-affect-empathy-usc-games/%20powerful" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">There is a growing group of digital creators who are designing Metaverse experiences</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to do this using Virtual Reality. </span><a href="https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/how-does-technology-affect-empathy-usc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Homeless Realities</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is a project from the </span><a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">University of Southern California (USC)</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> where students use virtual reality to tell stories, usually of marginalized communities that have been overlooked by traditional journalism. So powerful!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Do We Keep Our Kids Safe?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As parents, it’s essential that we add the Metaverse to our list of things to get our head around so we can keep our kids safe. Here are my top tips:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Commit To Understanding How It All Works</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While I very much appreciate you reading this post, it’s important that you take action and get involved – particularly if your kids are already. If your kids are using </span><a href="http://minecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Minecraft</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Fortnite</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://www.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Roblox</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> – sign up and understand yourself how it all works. If your kids have a VR headset and you’re not sure how it works – ask them for a turn and a lesson. Only by experiencing it for yourself, will you truly understand the attraction but also the pitfalls and risks.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Direct Your Kids To Age Appropriate Platforms</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As the Metaverse is still evolving and very much a work in progress, there are very minimal protections in place for users. However, the 3 platforms that tend to attract younger players (Roblox, Minecraft and Fortnite) all have parental control features. So, please direct them here – if you can – as you’ll be able to have more control over their online safety.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Minecraft and Fortnite allow parents to disable chat functions which means your kids can’t communicate with people they don’t know. Roblox will automatically apply certain safety settings depending on the age group of their account. But regardless of what their platform of choice is, always protect your credit card details!! I know Fortnite will only allow kids to make ‘in game’ purchases if these supply credit card details in the checkout.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Make Online Safety Part Of Your Family’s Dialogue</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your kids are older, it’s likely, you’ll have far less say over where they spend their time in the Metaverse so that’s when your kids will need to rely on their cyber safety skills to help them make safe decisions. Now, don’t assume that your child’s school has ticked the cyber safety box and it’s all been taken care of. Cybersafety needs to be weaved into your family’s dialogue and spoken about regularly. Even from the age of 5, your kids should know that they shouldn’t talk to strangers online or offline, if they see something that makes them upset online then they need to talk to a parent asap and, that they should never share their name or anything that could identify them online. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The goal of this is to make safe online behaviour part of their routine so that when they are faced with a challenging situation anywhere online, they automatically know how to respond. And of course, as kids get older, the advice becomes appropriate to their age.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Don’t Forget About Physical Safety Too</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Most kids are busting to get access to a VR headset but please take some time to do your research to work out which headsets are more suitable for your kids and your lounge room! There are 2 basic types: some that require a ‘tethered’ connection to a PC or standalone models with built-in computing power. The tethered headsets have traditionally delivered a more immersive user experience due to the extra computational power the PC provides however experts predict it won’t be long before standalone headsets are just as good. The biggest selling VR headset, </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/oculus-quest-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Occulus Quest 2</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, can in fact connect wirelessly to your PC with the option to connect via a cable in case the game or experience needs extra oomph!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of which type you choose, it’s important that there is a safe play area in which to use the headset. VR headsets completely removes any visual of the real world so please remove special vases and keepsakes and ensure the dog isn’t roaming around.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">‘Cybersickness’ aka motion sickness can be a real issue for some VR users. When you don the headset and are immersed in a different time and space, your body can get very confused. If your brain thinks you are moving (based on what you are seeing through the headset) but in fact you’re standing still, it creates a disconnect that causes enough confusion to make you feel nauseous. If this happens to your kids, consider reducing the time they spend with the headset, having fewer but smaller sessions to get your ‘VR legs’ and checking the VR headset is being worn correctly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, it’s over to you now parents: it’s time to get involved and understand this Metaverse once and for all. Always start with the games and experiences your kids spend their time on but when you’re ready, make sure you check out some of the more adult places such as </span><a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Decentraland</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/about/sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The Sandbox</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Who knows, you might just become a virtual real estate tycoon or set up a business that becomes quite the side hustle! The sky is the limit in the Metaverse!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Till next time!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Alex </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

They allow users to message their closest friends, family, and business partners without worrying about a stranger digitally eavesdropping on their conversation. The same people who message over encrypted services and apps are likely also diligent with securing their internet connections and using a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/vpn.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">VPN</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite all those safeguards, everyday people are left in the lurch when the companies with which they entrust their information are victims of cyberattacks. That was the case for users of the encrypted messaging app, Signal. Due to a phishing attack and subsequent leak of customer phone numbers, people are looking to identify potential consequences, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/learn/identity-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">protect themselve</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">s from SIM swapping, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/identity-theft/protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">monitor their identity,</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and take measures to make sure their information is safe in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What Happened? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A recent cyberattack targeted Signal, an end-to-end encrypted messaging service.</span><span data-contrast="auto">1</span><span data-contrast="auto"> The attackers exposed about 1,900 phone numbers belonging to Signal users. While other </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/take-it-personally-ten-tips-for-protecting-your-personally-identifiable-information-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">personally identifiable information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> (PII), message history, and contact lists were spared, valid phone numbers in the hands of a cybercriminal can be enough to wreak havoc on affected users. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is likely that another recent and successful phishing scheme at Twilio was the entry point for the Signal hackers. (Signal partners with Twilio to send SMS verification codes to people registering for the Signal app.) At Twilio, phishers tricked employees into divulging their credentials.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To rectify the situation and protect users, Signal is contacting affected users and asking them to re-register their devices. Also, the company is urging all users to enable registration lock, which is an additional security measure that requires a unique PIN to register a phone with Signal. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Lessons Learned</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are many lessons not only companies but everyday people can learn from the Signal and Twilio hacks. Here are some ways you can take action at the first signs of a compromised phone number and to help prevent cyber-events like this from happening to you. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Know the signs of SIM swapping </span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/what-is-sim-swapping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">SIM swapping</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> occurs when a cybercriminal gets ahold of your cellphone number and a few other pieces of your PII and registers your phone number to a device and a new SIM card that isn’t yours. If they successfully reregister your phone number, they can then access your data, change account passwords, and lock you out of your most important accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Luckily, since most of us use our phones every day, SIM swapping is usually detected quickly. If your phone isn’t connecting to the network and you’re not receiving calls and texts, it could be a sign that your wireless provider may have reassigned your number to an impersonator. In this case, contact your wireless provider immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To make SIM swapping nearly impossible, always turn on multifactor authentication. Also known as MFA, multifactor authentication is a method many online accounts use to ensure that only the authorized user can gain entry. This could entail sending a one-time code by email or text, prompting security questions, or scanning for fingerprint or facial recognition in addition to asking for the account password. MFA is an additional layer of security that’s quick to implement. The extra few seconds it takes to type in a code or stand still for a facial scan is well worth the frustration is causes cybercriminals. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Be selective with whom you share your PII</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These days, everyone has dozens of online accounts for everything from banking and shopping to streaming services and gaming. Since you can’t predict which company is going to be breached next, limit the number of possible doors a cybercriminal could break through to access your PII. In the Signal hack, it was their third-party vendor that was likely the cause of the leaked phone numbers. This unpredictability means it’s best to limit sharing your PII with as few accounts as possible. A great practice is to regularly </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/dont-let-old-accounts-haunt-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">organize your online accounts</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and deactivate the ones you no longer use.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Never share your passwords</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A phishing attack seems to have been the first domino to fall in the Twilio and Signal incident. It could’ve been prevented if everyone followed this absolute rule: Never share your password! Your employer nor your bank nor the IRS, for example, will ever ask you for your password to an online account. If you receive correspondence asking you to share your password, no matter how official it looks, do not comply. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Phishers often lace their electronic correspondences with an urgent or authoritarian tone, threatening severe consequences if they don’t receive a response within a short timeframe. This is a ploy to get people to act too quickly without thinking through the request. If you receive a message that outlines dire consequences for seemingly small infractions, step away from the message for at least 15 minutes and think it through. Stay calm and follow up through official channels, such as a listed phone number on the organization’s website or a customer service chat room, to iron out the alleged situation instead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stay Protected</span></b></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Diligent cybersecurity habits go a long way toward keeping you and your family’s PII out of the hands of malicious characters. However, in the case you trust a company with your information but it’s leaked in a breach, </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/mcafee-total-protection.html?path=blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">McAfee Total Protection</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> can give you peace of mind.

(Non-Fungible Tokens – think digital assets). </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But if you are confused about exactly what this all means and most importantly, what the metaverse actually is, then you are not alone. I’m putting together a 2-part series for parents that will help us get a handle on exactly what this new digital frontier promises and what we need to know to keep our kids safe. It will also ensure we don’t feel like dinosaurs! So, let’s get started.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">What is this Metaverse?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I think the best way of describing the Metaverse is that it’s a network of online 3D virtual worlds that mimic the real world. Once users have chosen their digital avatar, they can meet people, play games, do business, design fashion items, buy real estate, attend events, earn money, rear a pet – in fact, almost anything they can do in the ‘real’ world! And of course, all transactions are via cryptocurrencies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you are an avid Science Fiction reader, then you may have already come across the term in the 1992 novel </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">‘Snow Crash’</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> by Neal Stephenson. In the book, Stephenson envisions a virtual reality-based evolution of the internet in which his characters use digital avatars of themselves to explore the online world. Sounds eerily familiar, doesn’t it? </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Still confused? Check out either </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">the book</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Steven Spielberg’s movie adaption of Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Set in 2045, the book tells the story of people living in a war-ravaged world on the brink of collapse who turn to OASIS, a massively multiplayer online simulation game that has its own virtual world and currency. In the OASIS, they engage with each other, shop, play games and be transported to different locations. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Do You Access The Metaverse?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The best and most immersive way to access the metaverse is using a Virtual Reality (VR) headset and your internet connection, of course. VR headsets completely take over users’ vision and replace the outside world with a virtual one. Now, this maybe a game or a movie but VR headsets have their own set of apps which once downloaded, allows users to meditate, learn piano, work out at the gym or even attend a live concert in the metaverse! </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now access to the Metaverse is not just limited to those who own expensive headsets. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone (that is internet connected) can also have a metaverse experience. Of course, it won’t be as intense or immersive as the VR headset experience but it’s still a commonly used route to access the metaverse. Some of these ‘worlds’ suggest users can access their world using smartphones however experienced users don’t think this is a good idea as phones don’t have the necessary computational power to explore the metaverse properly.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As some of the most popular metaverse worlds can be accessed using your computer, why not check out </span><a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Decentraland</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The Sandbox</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://somniumspace.com/"><span data-contrast="none">Somnium</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> or even </span><a href="https://secondlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Second Life</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. In most of these worlds, users don’t have to create an account or spend money to start exploring however if you want the full experience then you’ll need to do so. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">How Much Does It Cost?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Entering the metaverse doesn’t cost anything, just like going on the internet doesn’t cost anything – apart from your internet connection and hardware, of course! And don’t forget that if you want a truly immersive 3D experience, then you might want to consider investing in a VR headset.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But, if you do want to access some of the features of the metaverse and invest in some virtual real estate or perhaps </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/01/19/how-luxury-brands-are-making-money-in-the-metaverse/?sh=1b5d201a5714" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">buy yourself a Gucci handbag</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, then you will need to put your hand into your virtual pocket and spend some of your virtual dollars. But the currency you will need depends entirely on the metaverse you are in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Decentraland</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">’s currency MANA is considered to be the most commonly used currency in the metaverse and also one of the best to invest in, according to some experts. MANA can be used to buy land, purchase avatars, names, wearables, and other items in the Decentraland marketplace.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/about/sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">The Sandbox</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> has a different currency, SAND, which is also used to buy items from The Sandbox marketplace. This is the second most popular currency however be prepared to buy the currency of the world you choose to spend your time in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, I totally appreciate that the whole concept of the Metaverse is a lot to get your head around. But if you have a tribe of kids, then chances are they are going to want to be part of it so don’t put it in the too-hard basket. Take some time to get your head around it: do some more reading, talk to your friends about it and check out some of the metaverses that you can access from your PC. Nothing beats experiencing it for yourself!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Part 2, I will be sharing my top tips and strategies to help us, parents, successfully guide our kids through the challenges and risks of the metaverse. So watch out for that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Till, next time – keep researching!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">If your child ever receives a suspicious-looking or -sounding email, they should start an entirely new email chain with the supposed sender and confirm that they sent the message.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">An excellent nugget of wisdom you can impart is the following: Never divulge your Social Security Number over online channels and never give out passwords. If someone needs your SSN for official purposes, they can follow up in a method other than email. And no one ever needs to know your password.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

Similar to phishing schemes, social media scams are usually “time sensitive” and attempt to inspire strong emotions in readers, whether that’s excitement, fear, sadness, or anger.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Alert your child that not everything they read on social media is true. Photos can be doctored and stories can be fabricated in order to prompt people to click on links to “donate” or “sign a petition.” You don’t have to discourage your child from taking a stand for causes they believe in; rather, urge them to follow up through official channels. For instance, if they see a social media post about contributing to save the rainforest, instead of donating through the post, contact a well-known organization, such as the World Wildlife Fund and inquire how to make a difference.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">More and more school systems are entrusting school-issued connected devices to students to use in the classroom and to bring home. Other districts have BYOD (or bring your own device) policies where students can use personal family devices for school activities. In either case, device security is key to keeping their information safe and maintaining the integrity of the school system’s network. Families don’t want to be the weakest link in the school system and are responsible for a town-wide education network breach.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">One finding that leaped out, in particular, is—cyberbullying occurs far more often than parents think.

<p><span data-contrast="none">Now with our follow-on research, we set out to answer many of the questions families have about cyberbullying. Where it happens most, who’s most affected, and are children cyberbullying others without even knowing it?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our report, “Hidden in Plain Sight: More Dangers of Cyberbullying Emerge,” provides insights into these questions and several more.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s talk about a few common </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto"> tactic </span><span data-contrast="auto">examples</span><span data-contrast="auto">, so you know the red flags to look out for when using </span><span data-contrast="auto">cash apps</span><span data-contrast="auto"> like </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Fake reward or cash prize</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In this type of </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto">, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will send you a </span><span data-contrast="auto">text message</span><span data-contrast="auto">, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">notification</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or an email with a link telling you that you won a cash prize or </span><span data-contrast="auto">trending</span> <span data-contrast="auto">concert tickets</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The link generally leads to a page that asks you to sign in or provide information about your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo account</span><span data-contrast="auto">. For example, the text could say something like, “As a long-time user of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">, you have received a $20 </span><span data-contrast="auto">gift card</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Sign in to redeem.” Filling in these details can lead to your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo account</span><span data-contrast="auto"> being hacked.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Prevent being </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> this way by never sharing your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto"> login information with any person or third-party website.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> may try to sign in to your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo account</span><span data-contrast="auto">, requiring them to enter a code sent to your mobile number. They will call you, pretend to be from the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span> <span data-contrast="auto">tech support</span><span data-contrast="auto"> or customer service team, and produce any plausible reason </span><span data-contrast="auto">they need you</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so you’ll share the code you received. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For example, this </span><span data-contrast="none">phone call</span><span data-contrast="none"> may sound like, “Hello, we have noticed some unauthorized transactions on your </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo account</span><span data-contrast="none">. This can lead to your account being blocked. To authorize the transactions, we need to confirm that you are the real owner of this account. For authentication purposes, we sent a code to your phone. Could you share that code with me, please?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When in the middle of a busy work day, this call might not seem like a big deal and you may share the code without suspecting the caller of </span><span data-contrast="none">smishing</span><span data-contrast="none">. However, this code might be part of </span><span data-contrast="none">multi-factor authentication</span><span data-contrast="none"> on </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="none"> and will give the </span><span data-contrast="none">scammer</span><span data-contrast="none"> access to your account. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This can also look a little different. For example, someone who claims to be a </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="none"> agent might ask you to transfer a sum of money into another account to “verify” your account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">To avoid being </span><span data-contrast="none">scammed</span><span data-contrast="none"> this way, keep in mind that a </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="none"> agent will never ask for a private code or try to gain access to your account. In addition, </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="none"> will never ask you to install a third-party app, redirect you to a different sign-in page, or ask you to send money to “verify” an account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As a rule of thumb, never share your </span><span data-contrast="none">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="none"> verification code with anyone, no matter who they claim to be.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Offers to make fast cash</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto"> has a few names, including pyramid scheme, money circle, or cash wheel. Here, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will persuade you to send them a small amount of money to earn back a larger sum within a short period. This is an easy </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to identify because you have no guarantee that the person will pay you back. However, </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can be extremely convincing, and you may fall for their words. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To avoid this </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/avoid-making-costly-mistakes-with-your-mobile-payment-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">mistake on the cash transfer app</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, don’t ever send money to strangers on </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it’s probably a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Someone posing as one of your friends</span></b></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In such a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto">, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will attempt to impersonate someone you know. For example, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is impersonating your friend “X.” They use any publicly available information about “X” and create an account using “X’s” name and picture. If “X’s” </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo account</span><span data-contrast="auto"> isn’t private, the </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> can access “X’s” transaction history. And, if “X” has transacted with you in the past, the </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> posing as “X” will connect with you and request money. Usually, these requests suggest an urgent need for money. Since you know “X,” you might consider lending them the amount.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Avoid this </span><span data-contrast="auto">scam</span><span data-contrast="auto"> by being wary of any unusual money requests from someone who looks like a friend. Before accepting the payment request, </span><span data-contrast="auto">double-check</span><span data-contrast="auto"> that the person requesting the money is your friend or a </span><span data-contrast="auto">family member</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Reach out to your friend outside of </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto"> through their phone or a credible </span><span data-contrast="auto">social media</span><span data-contrast="auto"> account to verify that it’s not a fake profile asking you for money. In addition, you should always keep your </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo </span><a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/217532217-Adding-Removing-Friends-" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">friend list</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/210413717-Payment-Activity-Privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">transaction history</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> private to avoid giving </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammers</span><span data-contrast="auto"> access to your data.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<h3 aria-level="3"><b><span data-contrast="none">Scams</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none"> when buying or selling things online</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134245418&quot;:false,&quot;134245529&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:280,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re selling goods online, a buyer might try to obtain your goods without actually paying for your product. So, they may send you a </span><span data-contrast="auto">screenshot</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of a </span><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/types-of-online-banking-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">fake payment</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to prove they have paid when you haven’t received any money. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sometimes, a </span><span data-contrast="auto">scammer</span><span data-contrast="auto"> will send a </span><span data-contrast="auto">screenshot</span><span data-contrast="auto"> showing that they accidentally paid you an extra sum of money, and may ask you to pay the money back. However, their payment was fake, and you will end up paying money from your pocket. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another example involves a seller who sends a message that seems like it’s from </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">. The message might say that the buyer made a payment, but it will only be fully processed once goods are shipped. Again, this is a red flag to watch out for because </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto"> doesn’t offer this feature.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re a buyer online, your seller may convince you to </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto"> them the entire payment, and then they may refuse to ship the purchased goods to you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To be protected from such </span><span data-contrast="auto">scams</span><span data-contrast="auto">, avoid selling and buying items using </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">. If you’re buying from strangers on </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">, ensure it is a </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">-approved business account so you have purchase protection for any eligible items covered under the </span><span data-contrast="auto">user agreement</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a rule, it’s best not to exchange </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo payments</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with strangers. Consider </span><a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/222478088" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">blocking the user</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> if you receive an unsolicited payment or a payment request from a stranger on </span><span data-contrast="auto">Venmo</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

In fact, some of us have probably even been known to roll our eyes or groan when we think about just how long our kids spend playing online games. But if there is one thing I’ve learned after 25 years of parenting, it’s that taking the time to look at a stressful family situation from the perspective of my children, can be very powerful. In fact, it can almost always fast track finding a mutually agreeable work-around for everyone – and gaming is the perfect example. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why Do Our Kids Love Gaming?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have all read about how </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2016/08/27/its-digital-heroin-how-screens-turn-kids-into-psychotic-junkies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">online gaming can provide players with regular hits of dopamine </span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> &#8211;  a neurotransmitter in the brain that becomes active when you participate in fun and pleasurable activities. Now I am not disputing this for a moment – I’ve witnessed it firsthand! However, it is important to remember that dopamine increases whenever we do anything enjoyable – pop a square of chocolate in our mouth or watch our favorite sporting team win &#8211; not just when we play online games.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many online games have cleverly designed built-in reward systems, and many experts believe that it is the combination of dopamine and reward that probably best explains why our kids are such gaming fans. Now, these reward systems are intentionally unpredictable so players are aware they will eventually get a reward, but they have no idea as to when or how often it is coming &#8211; so they are compelled to keep playing! Very clever!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In my opinion, gaming also fills several other needs in our children – the need to belong, to feel competent and be independent. And while we may have had these needs addressed very differently in the 70’s and 80’s &#8211; hanging at the bus stop, mastering the Rubix cube and not being helicopter parented, our batch of digital natives will often use gaming as their go-to solution.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">Why You Should See Gaming Through The Eyes of Your Child</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When many of us parents think about our kids’ online gaming, our initial thought is ‘how do we make our kids stop’. But I can you this isn’t the right approach. Online gaming isn’t going anywhere. So, taking the time to see gaming from your child’s perspective and understand why it is such a big part of their life is where you need to focus your energy. I guarantee this will further strengthen your relationship with your child and help you introduce rules that they will better respect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Let’s take a moment to channel the great Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird and focus on his words of inspiration for us all: ‘“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view&#8230;until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” Ah yes – very wise words!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="auto">My Top Tips For A Happy Gaming Family</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So, if you are keen to stop gaming being a negative issue in your family, here are my top tips to help you get it under control and stop it causing family tension:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">1. Change Your Thinking</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you find yourself thinking ‘how do I get my kids to stop gaming’, you’re barking up the wrong tree. Gaming isn’t going anywhere and as parents, we don’t want to drive an unnecessary wedge between ourselves and our kids. Instead, commit to having an open mind. Think ’Ok, let’s give this gaming thing a go’.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">2. Talk To Your Kids About Their Gaming – With No Tone</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When the time is right, ask your kids what their favourite games are and why. Your aim is to get them talking. You could even do your research in advance and drop in the names of a few popular games to ask them about. ‘My work friend’s son plays Roblox, do you know much about that?’</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">3. Play Along!</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Even if you aren’t that interested, I promise, playing along will open your eyes. You’ll better understand how the game’s reward system works and what it feels like to get a shot of digital dopamine! And most importantly, it will be great for your relationship with your child. By taking the time to play with them, you are showing that you are interested in their life and their hobbies.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">4. Educate Yourself About All Thing Gaming</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When your kids started their social media journey, chances are you spent a little time familiarising yourself with the various platforms they joined. Well, you need to adopt the same approach with their gaming life too. Here are a few areas to focus on: </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>

Having an open mind about gaming doesn’t mean it’s OK for them to play games that are not age-appropriate. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">5. Introduce Fair, Age-Appropriate Rules Around Gaming</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Once you’ve taken the time to understand your child’s gaming life, cleared your mind of any unnecessary negative gaming thoughts and done your research, why not put together a set of family rules for gaming? You may like to consider a </span><a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents/skills-and-advice/family-tech-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">family tech agreement</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and have a separate section for gaming. Or you may prefer to keep it more casual and have the rules written on the fridge or shared in the family group chat. Regardless of what you choose, ensure that you introduce these boundaries when everyone is calm and in a good head space NOT when you’re in the middle of a verbal stoush!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You could choose to give your children a set amount of time they can use each week on gaming and then let them choose when to use it or you allocate a small time everyday once they’ve completed homework and chores. When my boys were younger, I didn’t allow gaming Monday – Thursday but after school Friday was always quite the gaming fest – a reward for getting through the school week. Do what works for your family!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There’s no question that this digital parenting gig is complicated. Trying to help your kids find the right balance between embracing the online world and offline world can often feel hard to get right. But if you’re ever in doubt about whether you’re on track when it comes to managing your kids’ gaming, always ask yourself – have I kept an open mind? Have I taken the time to talk to my kids and understand their gaming life? Are the gaming rules fair? And, if you have answered yes, then I have every confidence that you have the right approach to ensuring gaming is a positive part of your family’s life. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
